&nbsp; Year: 2014

&nbsp; DOI: 10.1016/j.aan.2014.08.011

**Abstract:**

This review outlines anesthesia strategies for modern diagnostic and therapeutic bronchoscopy, emphasizing that case mix, procedure duration, and “shared airway” demands favor general anesthesia (often TIVA with neuromuscular blockade) over moderate sedation for most advanced procedures. It summarizes anesthetic implications for optical diagnostics, EBUS (including prolonged, systematic mediastinal staging), and electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy, then details management of malignant central airway obstruction: choosing rigid vs flexible bronchoscopy, combining rapid mechanical debulking with immediate or delayed ablative modalities, and placing airway stents when extrinsic or mixed lesions threaten early re-collapse. Practical pearls include using a large-ID endotracheal tube (8.5–9.0 mm) with a swivel adapter for simultaneous ventilation and scope manipulation (pp. 10–11), selecting a supraglottic airway for subglottic targets or small patients (p. 11), maintaining high fresh gas flows and titrating FiO₂ below ~40%—ideally ~30%—during airway laser/electrocautery (p. 12), and packing around rigid bronchoscopes to limit leaks during conventional positive-pressure ventilation (p. 13). Special sections address bronchial thermoplasty sessions and complex scenarios (e.g., Montgomery T-tubes), perioperative risk reduction (restrict fluids, cautious premedication), and common complications (hypoxemia/hypercapnia, pneumothorax, bleeding), with most patients suitable for same-day discharge after brief observation. The central message is meticulous pre-op assessment, continuous anesthesiologist–pulmonologist communication, and technique tailoring to patient, pathology, and device to optimize safety and outcomes. Keywords: advanced bronchoscopy, anesthesia, EBUS, electromagnetic navigation, rigid bronchoscopy, airway stent, FiO₂ management, TIVA.

&nbsp; Year: 2013

&nbsp; DOI: 10.1136/thoraxjnl-2013-203618

**Abstract:**

This BTS guideline updates evidence-based recommendations for adult diagnostic flexible bronchoscopy (FB), covering monitoring, complications, sedation/topical anesthesia, infection control, staffing, and key diagnostic procedures. It emphasizes continuous monitoring (pulse oximetry for all; ECG when at higher cardiac risk) and targeted oxygen supplementation during significant, sustained desaturation. Scope includes FB in special populations (e.g., ICU), diagnostic yield targets (e.g., visible endobronchial tumor), and patient-safety processes, while excluding training and advanced therapeutic techniques. Keywords: flexible bronchoscopy, monitoring, sedation, safety, diagnostic yield, guideline.

&nbsp; Title: British Thoracic Society Guideline for pleural disease

&nbsp; Year: 2025

&nbsp; DOI: 10.1136/thorax-2023-220304

**Abstract:**

This guideline synthesizes contemporary, GRADE-based recommendations across four domains—spontaneous pneumothorax, undiagnosed unilateral pleural effusion, pleural infection, and pleural malignancy—reflecting major evidence shifts since 2010. It details diagnostic pathways (e.g., mandatory image-guided thoracentesis; optimized pleural fluid sampling volumes) and treatment algorithms (e.g., small-bore drainage first-line in pleural infection, tPA+DNase for residual collections). For malignant pleural effusion, it advises not postponing definitive pleural intervention until after systemic therapy and offers either IPC or pleurodesis when lung is expandable; imaging recommendations clarify the complementary roles of ultrasound and CT. Keywords: pleural effusion, pneumothorax, pleural infection, malignant pleural effusion, GRADE, guideline.

&nbsp; Year: 2002

&nbsp; DOI: 10.1183/09031936.02.00204602

**Abstract:**

Defines the scope of interventional pulmonology (IP) and sets minimum standards for facilities, personnel, monitoring, and pre-procedure evaluation. Provides procedure-by-procedure summaries of indications, technique, outcomes, complications, and training requirements for rigid bronchoscopy, TBNA, autofluorescence bronchoscopy, EBUS, transthoracic needle aspiration/biopsy, laser therapy, electrosurgery/argon-plasma coagulation, cryotherapy, airway stents, endobronchial brachytherapy, photodynamic therapy, percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy, and transtracheal oxygen therapy. Emphasizes multimodality care for central airway disease and prescribes systematic outcome documentation (accuracy, symptom relief, QoL, complications) to support quality control. Keywords: interventional pulmonology, standards, training, airway obstruction, stents, ablative therapies.

&nbsp; Title: Endobronchial Epinephrine: Confusion Is in the Air

&nbsp; Year: 2013

&nbsp; DOI: 10.1164/rccm.201209-1682LE

**Abstract:**

A literature review highlights wide variation in topical epinephrine dosing/dilution for bronchoscopic bleeding and the potential for arrhythmias even at low doses. The authors’ pragmatic recommendations: try iced saline first; if epinephrine is used, monitor continuously, use small aliquots of 1:100,000 up to 0.6 mg total, switch early to tamponade/adjuncts if bleeding persists, consider norepinephrine to limit tachycardia, and avoid use in high-risk patients (coronary disease, arrhythmia, carcinoid). The accompanying reply underscores that peripheral instillation (e.g., via guide sheath during TBLB) may cause greater systemic absorption—epinephrine should not be instilled into distal airways; manage TBLB bleeding with iced saline and bronchoscopic tamponade, with major adverse events from TBLB bleeding being rare. Keywords: bronchoscopy, bleeding control, epinephrine dosing, safety, iced saline, tamponade.

&nbsp; DOI: 10.1136/thx.2010.137026

**Abstract:**

Practice standard for pleural aspiration and chest drain insertion. Key safety points: train with simulation + supervision; use full asepsis; strongly favor bedside ultrasound for all pleural fluid procedures to reduce pneumothorax and “dry taps”; prefer small-bore over large-bore needles; avoid routine post-tap CXR unless difficult/air aspirated. Therapeutic taps: stop if symptoms arise, no more fluid can be withdrawn, or after ~1.5 L in the first hour to reduce re-expansion edema risk; pleural manometry can guide large-volume drainage when available. Chest tubes: small-bore drains first-line for pneumothorax, effusions, and empyema; avoid clamping a bubbling drain; ultrasound-guided placement reduces malposition; routine antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended (except selected trauma). Includes analgesia/sedation guidance and “triangle of safety” insertion site. Keywords: pleural aspiration, ultrasound guidance, chest tubes, re-expansion edema, small-bore drains, safety.

&nbsp; Year: 2010

&nbsp; DOI: 10.1136/thx.2010.136978

**Abstract:**

Algorithmic approach to diagnosis: in clear transudates (e.g., heart failure) avoid aspiration unless atypical or non-responsive; otherwise perform US-guided diagnostic tap with routine protein/LDH (apply Light’s criteria), microbiology, and cytology. Highlights: ultrasound increases success and reduces complications; cytology diagnoses malignant effusion in ~60% (limited added yield beyond two samples); NT-proBNP in serum or pleural fluid helps identify misclassified cardiac effusions; CT with contrast (before complete drainage) refines malignant vs benign features; thoracoscopy is preferred after non-diagnostic aspiration if malignancy is suspected. Covers TB work-up (ADA as useful rule-out, thoracoscopic biopsy for culture/histology), chylothorax vs pseudochylothorax differentiation (triglycerides/chylomicrons vs cholesterol crystals), and when “watchful waiting” is reasonable after non-specific pleuritis. Keywords: pleural effusion, Light’s criteria, NT-proBNP, thoracoscopy, ADA, chylothorax.

&nbsp; Year: 2018

&nbsp; DOI: 10.21037/jtd.2018.05.140

**Abstract:**

Reviews indications, selection, placement, and aftercare of silicone Montgomery T-tubes for subglottic/upper tracheal benign stenosis, particularly when surgery is not feasible. Pre-op planning includes CT (±3D), laryngoscopy, and sizing (commonly 11–14 mm diameter), aiming to position the upper limb ≥0.5–1 cm below the glottis; stenoses <2 cm from the glottis are poor candidates. Describes three insertion strategies under general anesthesia (including methods that maintain ventilation), and the need to first recanalize obstructed segments (balloon, mechanical, or thermal). Early issues: cough, mucus, transient dyspnea; late issues: proximal granulation from micromotion, mucus impaction/dry crusts, secondary infection—mitigated by humidification, hydration, and periodic toilet. Extubation timing is individualized (literature: ~6–18 months), with airway reassessment and backup tracheostomy access if needed. Keywords: tracheal stenosis, T-tube, airway stenting, rigid bronchoscopy, complications, extubation **timing.**

&nbsp; Year: 2024

&nbsp; DOI: 10.1016/j.jtho.2024.07.010

**Abstract:**

The forthcoming 9th IASLC TNM lung cancer classification subdivides N2 disease into N2a (single mediastinal nodal station) and N2b (multiple mediastinal stations), a change that directly affects invasive mediastinal staging strategies. The authors argue that, to stage T1–T3 tumors accurately under this schema, endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) should systematically sample all ipsilateral mediastinal and subcarinal stations—expanding beyond a single most-suspicious N2 node—and, when indicated by PET-CT uptake, extend to inferior mediastinal stations via EUS-b. They further note Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE) remains valuable for ensuring representativeness and reducing unnecessary passes, even as more stations are sampled. The letter calls for prospective validation of PET-CT and sonographic features that might safely exempt minute or low-SUV N2 nodes from biopsy. Keywords: EBUS, TNM 9th edition, N2a/N2b, systematic sampling, ROSE.

&nbsp; Year: 1994

&nbsp; DOI: 10.1097/00128594-199404000-00006

**Abstract:**

In this single-center series (1982–1993), 1,585 lung cancer patients underwent 2,253 rigid-bronchoscopic Nd:YAG laser treatments for malignant central airway obstruction. Immediate clinical/radiologic/endoscopic improvement occurred in 93%; median time to retreatment was 100 days, reflecting tumor regrowth as the chief limitation. Major complications were uncommon (hemorrhage n=18, transient pneumothorax n=6) with mortality 0.44%; laser debulking also facilitated curative or lesser surgery in select cases and was curative for a small subset with carcinoma in situ. The authors conclude Nd:YAG photoresection is a rapid, repeatable, palliative modality that restores airway patency and can be combined with radiotherapy, brachytherapy, stenting, or surgery. Keywords: airway obstruction, interventional bronchoscopy, laser debulking, outcomes, safety.

&nbsp; DOI: 10.1164/ajrccm.185.9.1028

**Abstract:**

Two otherwise low-risk patients developed immediate ventricular fibrillation seconds after endobronchial epinephrine (5 mL of 1:20,000; total 0.25 mg) was instilled via a radial-EBUS guide sheath to control transbronchial lung biopsy bleeding; both were cardioverted successfully and had no structural heart disease. The authors note that major adverse outcomes from TBLB bleeding are rare and the hemostatic benefit of endobronchial epinephrine is uncertain. They recommend iced saline and bronchoscopic tamponade as first-line therapy and advise against administering epinephrine into the lung periphery via a guide sheath because of the risk of malignant arrhythmia.

&nbsp; DOI: 10.1016/j.chpulm.2024.100128

**Abstract:** 

BACKGROUND: Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (BLVR) has emerged as a promising therapeutic option for patients with COPD. The development of a dedicated BLVR program requires significant resources, both from an interventional pulmonology (IP) team and from the medical center. The financial value of this program is important to assess to develop a feasible and sustainable plan for providing this service in the future. RESEARCH QUESTION: Can a BLVR program bring value to a medical center in terms of patient referrals, revenue, and contribution margin? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients who were referred for BLVR to the interventional pulmonology clinic at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC). Patient demographics were obtained. Outpatient services used to determine candidacy for endobronchial valve placement were analyzed and revenue was estimated. For patients who had valve placement, revenue from the bronchoscopic procedure and subsequent inpatient hospitalization was calculated and the contribution margin of the procedure was estimated. RESULTS: An estimated total of $1 to 1.4 million in revenue was generated in the workup and placement of endobronchial valves for 37 patients. The total revenue for the care of 52 patients deemed not to be candidates for the valve procedure was $144,000 to $170,000. The contribution margin for the procedure was estimated to be 25%. The median length of stay was 3 days. Among all 89 patients referred for BLVR, 26 referrals were made to other specialties at BIDMC during workup. Of these patients, 69.6% were new patients referred to BIDMC for BLVR. INTERPRETATION: In addition to the established therapeutic benefit of BLVR for patients with COPD, a BLVR program in a dedicated, specialized center is economically valuable and sustainable, attracts referrals from other medical centers and health care systems, and generates internal referrals within the medical center.

&nbsp; Title: Risks of and Recommendations for Flexible Bronchoscopy in Pregnancy\* A Review

&nbsp; Year: 2004

&nbsp; DOI: 10.1378/chest.126.6.1974

**Abstract:**

This review outlines physiologic respiratory changes in pregnancy relevant to FB, catalogs procedure- and sedation-related maternal/fetal risks, and offers pragmatic recommendations for case selection and intra-procedure monitoring. Evidence (largely small or indirect) suggests endoscopy during pregnancy is feasible when clinically indicated, but attention to hypoxemia, hypercapnia, aspiration risk, and drug safety is essential; the review stresses continuous monitoring (e.g., pulse oximetry), minimization of sedatives, left-lateral positioning in late gestation, and individualized risk–benefit decisions (including limited use of fluoroscopy). Keywords: pregnancy, bronchoscopy safety, sedation, monitoring, fetal risk.

&nbsp; Year: 2010

&nbsp; DOI: 10.1136/thx.2010.136994

**Abstract:**

Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) signifies disseminated disease with median survival typically 3–12 months, varying by primary tumor. The guideline recommends tailoring management to symptoms, performance status, and lung re-expandability, with complete drainage plus pleurodesis as the cornerstone to prevent recurrence; observation may be reasonable if asymptomatic, while repeated aspiration alone is discouraged due to high 1-month recurrence. The document also summarizes common primaries leading to MPE and provides a structured set of therapeutic options—including intercostal tube drainage with sclerosant, thoracoscopy with pleurodesis, and indwelling pleural catheters. Keywords: malignant pleural effusion, pleurodesis, indwelling pleural catheter, guideline, prognosis.

**Abstract:**

Editorial overview of the IASLC process and proposals for the 9th-edition TNM staging (planned for 2025). Using large international databases (~100k lung cancers; additional thymic and mesothelioma cohorts), the Staging and Prognostic Factors Committee proposes key refinements including subdivision of mediastinal nodal disease into single-station N2a versus multi-station N2b, and metastatic disease into M1c1 (single organ system) versus M1c2 (multiple organ systems). Thymic tumors gain size-based and invasion-based T refinements; no changes are proposed for esophageal cancer; mesothelioma analyses are ongoing. The piece underscores guiding principles (data-driven changes, multi-tier validation, clinical practicality) and reminds readers that stage remains an anatomic nomenclature to be used alongside other prognostic and therapeutic factors. Keywords: lung cancer staging, TNM 9th edition, IASLC, N2a/N2b, M1c1/M1c2, thymic tumors, methodology.

&nbsp; Year: 2024

&nbsp; DOI: 10.1016/j.jtho.2024.06.003

**Abstract:**

Summarizes new evidence supporting subdivision of mediastinal nodal disease into single-station (N2a) vs multi-station (N2b) to reduce prognostic heterogeneity and sharpen treatment decisions. Notes clinical implications for surgical candidacy amid growing use of neoadjuvant chemo-immunotherapy, while cautioning about real-world challenges: variability in invasive mediastinal staging, difficulty differentiating N2a/N2b after induction therapy, and non-standardized lymph-node assessment. Calls for consistent nodal evaluation methods and for integrating molecular factors as databases evolve. Keywords: lung cancer staging, TNM 9th edition, N2a/N2b, mediastinal staging, prognosis, standardization.
