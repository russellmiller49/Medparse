The technological advancement of 3D printing has far exceeded its implementation in medicine. The application of 3D printing technology has the potential of playing a major role within interventional pulmonology; specifically, in the management of complex airway disease. Tailoring management to the patient-specific anatomical malformation caused by benign or malignant disease is a major challenge faced by interventional pulmonologists. Such cases often require adjunctive therapeutic procedures with thermal therapies followed by dilation and airway stenting to maintain the patency of the airway. Airway-stent size matching is one key to reducing stent-related complications. A major barrier to matching is the expansion of the stent in two dimensions (fixed sizes in length and diameter) within the deformed airway. Additional challenges are created by the subjective oversizing of the stent to reduce the likelihood of migration. Improper sizing adversely affects the stability of the stent. The stent-airway mismatch can be complicated by airway erosion, perforation, or the formation of granulation tissue. Stents can migrate, fracture, obstruct, or become infected. The use of patient-specific 3D printed airway stents may be able to reduce the stent airway mismatch. These stents allow more precise stent-airway sizing and minimizes high-pressure points on distorted airway anatomy. In theory, this should reduce the incidence of the well-known complications of factory manufactured stents. In this article, the authors present the brief history of 3D printed stents, their consideration in select patients, processing steps for development, and future direction.","2019-02","2025-09-01 18:44:38","2025-09-01 18:44:38","2025-09-01 18:44:38","14-14","","","4","","AME Med.

Methods: 1214 pediatric patients (≤3 years old) undergoing rigid bronchoscopy for AFB from June 2014 to December 2020 were enrolled in this study. The primary outcome was the occurrence of mPRAEs, including laryngospasm and bronchospasm. Following that, a nomogram prediction model for the mPRAEs was developed. Results: The incidence of mPRAEs was 84 (6.9%) among 1214 subjects. American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status (ASA-PS), intraoperative desaturation (SpO2 < 90%), procedural duration and ventilatory approach were all independent risk factors of mPRAEs. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value of the nomogram for predicting mPRAEs was 0.815 (95% CI: 0.770–0.861), and the average AUC for ten-fold cross-validation was 0.799. These nomograms were well calibrated by Hosmer-Lemshow (p = 0.607). Decision curve analysis showed that the nomogram prediction model is effective in clinical settings. Conclusions: Combining ASA-PS, intraoperative desaturation, procedural duration, and ventilatory approach, the nomogram model is adequate for predicting the risk of developing mPRAEs, followed by rigid bronchoscopy for AFB removal and exploration.","2023-08-25","2025-09-01 18:44:41","2025-09-01 18:44:41","2025-09-01 18:44:41","5552","","17","12","","JCM","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/NBERM6HV/Yi et al. - 2023 - A Predictive Model of Major Postoperative Respiratory Adverse Events in Pediatric Patients Undergoin.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They were prospectively followed for survival, QOL, and toxicity endpoints. QOL measures were captured using the Quality of Life QuestionnaireeLung Cancer 30 and eLung Cancer 13. RESULTS: At 1-year follow-up, no signiﬁcant toxicities were seen. Overall survival was 13.4% at 12 months (mean 192 days). Performance status, additional treatment after HDREBBT and treatment intent affected overall survival on univariate analysis ( p ! 0.05). Mean hemoptysis-free survival for all patients was 232.3 days, cough-free survival was 140.3 days, and dyspnea-free survival was 173.5 days. There was no impact of any treatment- or patient-related factors of these outcomes on multivariate analysis, including additional treatment modalities and HDREBBT dose. CONCLUSIONS: HDREBBT is a safe and effective way to palliate endobronchial symptoms. Additional external-beam radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or chemoradiation after HDREBBT improves survival, but does not affect QOL measures.

Methods: Patients with conﬁrmed or suspected non–small cell lung cancer who required mediastinoscopy to determine suitability for lung cancer resection were entered into the trial. All patients underwent EBUSTBNA followed by mediastinoscopy under general anesthesia. If both were negative for N2 or N3 disease, the patient underwent pulmonary resection and mediastinal lymphadenectomy. Results: Between July 2006 and August 2010, 190 patients were registered in the study, 159 enrolled, and 153 were eligible for analysis. EBUS-TBNA and mediastinoscopy sampled an average of 3 and 4 lymph node stations per patient, respectively. The mean short axis of the lymph node biopsied by EBUS-TBNAwas 6.9 2.9 mm. The prevalence of N2/N3 disease was 35% (53/153). There was excellent agreement between EBUS-TBNA and mediastinoscopy for mediastinal staging in 136 patients (91%; Kappa, 0.8; 95% conﬁdence interval, 0.7–0.9). Speciﬁcity and positive predictive value for both techniques were 100%. The sensitivity, negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy for mediastinal lymph node staging for EBUS-TBNA and mediastinoscopy were 81%, 91%, 93%, and 79%, 90%, 93%, respectively. No signiﬁcant differences were found between EBUS-TBNA and mediastinoscopy in determining the true pathologic N stage (McNemar’s test, P ¼ .78). There were no complications from EBUS-TBNA. Minor complications from mediastinoscopy were observed in 4 patients (2.6%). Conclusions: EBUS-TBNA and mediastinoscopy achieve similar results for the mediastinal staging of lung cancer. As performed in this study, EBUS-TBNA can replace mediastinoscopy in patients with potentially resectable non–small cell lung cancer.

Metal stents can be placed using ﬂexible bronchoscopy under local anesthesia but may be diﬃcult to remove. Silicone stents require rigid bronchoscopy and general anesthesia to place but they are relatively easy to remove. A new hybrid stent, the AERO stent (Alveolus Inc, Charlotte, NC), has a completely covered nitinol framework. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the eﬃcacy and safety of this new hybrid stent for the treatment of malignant airway obstruction. Methods: This was a prospective multicenter intention to treat study. Eligible patients with malignant airway obstruction underwent self-expanding hybrid stent placement at 11 centers between June 2005 and December 2006. Patients were evaluated immediately postprocedure and at 7, 30, and 90 days postprocedure. Ease of deployment was assessed on a 4-point Likert scale. Luminal patency was visually assessed preimplant and postimplant by investigators and veriﬁed in blinded review of photographs taken during the procedure. Quality of life was measured using the Baseline Dyspnea Index and Transitional Dyspnea Index. Results: Fifty-six patients (53% male, 47% female, median age 65.7) underwent stent placement. Physicians rated ease of deployment at 3.6 on a 1 to 4 scale with 1 being poor and 4 being excellent. Eighty-eight percent of patients had a lumen patency improvement of >50% (P&<0.05). Dyspnea indices demonstrated quality of life improvement postimplant as compared with baseline values (average improvement in Transitional Dyspnea Index of 2.9 at 7 d and 3.2 at 30 d, P<0.05) Complications included hemoptysis, infection, granulation tissue formation, stent migration, and pain at rates comparable with previously published studies. Stent removal, when clinically indicated, was accomplished without diﬃculty or complication in 7 patients. Conclusions: In patients with malignant airway obstruction, selfexpanding hybrid stent were easy to deploy and remove and improved luminal patency and quality of life with an acceptable complication rate. Further trials are needed to assess the longterm outcomes of this new stent technology.","2008","2025-09-01 18:44:45","2025-09-01 18:44:45","","","","4","15","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/VJ6IUDQ6/Gildea et al. - 2008 - A Prospective Multicenter Trial of a Self-expanding Hybrid Stent in Malignant Airway Obstruction.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This randomized controlled trial compared the efficacy and safety of 1% and 2% lignocaine solution for topical anesthesia during FB. METHODS: Consecutive patients were randomized to receive either 1% or 2% lignocaine solution through the bronchoscope by the “spray-as-you-go” technique. The primary outcome of the study was the assessment of cough by the operator and the patient using the visual analog scale (VAS) and pain assessment using the faces pain rating scale. The secondary outcomes included total lignocaine dose, oxygenation status, adverse reactions related to lignocaine, and others. RESULTS: Five hundred patients were randomized (median age, 51 years; 71% men) 1:1 to either group. The median operator VAS score for cough was significantly higher (25 vs 21, P 5 .015) in the 1% group; however, the patient VAS score was not significantly different (32 vs 27, P5.065). The pain rating was similar between the two groups. The median cumulative dose of lignocaine was significantly higher in the 2% group (397 mg vs 312 mg, P 5 .0001; 7.1 mg/kg vs 5.7 mg/kg, P 5 .0001). About 28% of patients in the 2% group exceeded the maximum recommended dose (. 8.2 mg/kg) of lignocaine. No adverse event related to lignocaine overdose was seen in either group. CONCLUSIONS: One percent lignocaine was found to be as effective as 2% solution for topical anesthesia during FB, albeit at a significantly lower dose as the latter.

This systemic review and meta-analysis investigated the effectiveness of small-bore pigtail catheter (PC) drainage compared with that of large-bore chest tube (LBCT) drainage as the initial treatment approach for all subtypes of pneumothorax. METHODS: PubMed and Embase were systematically searched for observational studies and randomized controlled trials published up to October 9, 2017, that compared PC and LBCT as the initial treatment for pneumothorax. The investigative outcomes included success rates, recurrence rates, complication rates, drainage duration, and hospital stay. RESULTS: Of the 11 included studies (875 patients), the success rate was similar in the PC (79.84%) and LBCT (82.87%) groups, with a risk ratio of 0.99 (95% CI, 0.93 to 1.05; I2 ¼ 0%). Speciﬁcally, PC drainage was associated with a signiﬁcantly lower complication rate following spontaneous pneumothorax than LBCT drainage (Peto odds ratio: 0.49 [95% CI, 0.28 to 0.85]; I2 ¼ 29%). In the spontaneous subgroup, PC drainage was associated with a signiﬁcantly shorter drainage duration (mean difference, 1.51 [95% CI, 2.93 to 0.09]) and hospital stay (mean difference: 2.54 [95% CI, 3.16 to 1.92]; P < .001) than the LBCT group. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, results of the meta-analysis suggest PC drainage may be considered as the initial treatment option for patients with primary or secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. Ideally, randomized controlled trials are needed to compare PC vs LBCT among different subgroups of patients with pneumothorax, which may ultimately improve clinical care and management for these patients.","2018-05","2025-09-01 18:44:51","2025-09-01 18:44:51","2025-09-01 18:44:51","1201-1212","","5","153","","Chest","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/DK2T2L2L/Chang et al. - 2018 - A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Comparing Pigtail Catheter and Chest Tube as the Initial Treat.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods:               The Trustworthy Consensus-Based Statement approach was utilized to develop unbiased, scientifically valid guidance for the management of patients with malignant effusions treated with indwelling pleural catheters. A comprehensive electronic database search of PubMed was performed based on a priori crafted PICO questions (Population/Intervention/Comparator/Outcomes paradigm). Manual searches of the literature were performed to identify additional relevant literature. Dual screenings at the title, abstract, and full-text levels were performed. Identified studies were then assessed for quality based on a combination of validated tools. Appropriateness for data pooling and formation of evidence-based recommendations was assessed using predetermined criteria. All panel members participated in development of the final recommendations utilizing the modified Delphi technique.

Lung cancer biomarker adequacy, defined as successful testing of guidelinerecommended biomarkers including, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR); serine/threonine protein kinase B-Raf (BRAF); anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK); proto-oncogene tyrosine protein kinase ROS (ROS1); Rearranged during Transfection (RET); Tyrosine protein kinase Met (MET); and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), was evaluated. Results A total of 865 cases were evaluated in this study, 785 of which included testing of all lung cancer biomarkers. Lung tissue was adequate for biomarker testing in 84% of cases; this rate increased to 87% when biomarker testing was combined with concurrently acquired FNA or CNB specimens. Biomarker testing success correlated strongly with DNA concentration (p<0.0001) and the use of 22G needles in endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) procedures (p=0.0035). Biomarker testing of CNB specimens showed a significantly higher success rate than did biomarker testing of cytology FNA specimens (p=0.0005). The adequacy of EBUS-TBNA samples was not significantly different from that of the transthoracic needle aspiration samples (p=0.40). Variables such as age, gender, lesion size, site, diagnosis and number of needle passes showed no significant correlation with success rates in lung cancer biomarker testing.

While surgical resection of malignant nodules is still the preferred treatment option, it may not be feasible for all patients. We aimed to discuss the advances in the treatment of pulmonary nodules, especially stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and interventional pulmonology technologies, and provide a range of recommendations based on our expertise and experience. <b><i>Summary:</i></b> Interventional pulmonology is an increasingly important approach for the management of pulmonary nodules. While more studies are needed to fully evaluate its long-term outcomes and benefits, the available evidence suggests that this technique can provide a minimally invasive and effective alternative for treating small malignancies in selected patients. We conducted a systematic literature review in PubMed, designed a framework to include the advances in surgery, SBRT, and interventional pulmonology for the treatment of pulmonary nodules, and provided a range of recommendations based on our expertise and experience. <b><i>Key Messages:</i></b> As such, alternative therapeutic options such as SBRT and ablation are becoming increasingly important and viable. With recent advancements in bronchoscopy techniques, ablation via bronchoscopy has emerged as a promising option for treating pulmonary nodules. This study reviewed the advances of interventional pulmonology in the treatment of peripheral lung cancer patients that are not surgical candidates. We also discussed the challenges and limitations associated with ablation, such as the risk of complications and the potential for incomplete nodule eradication.

Methods: A prospective observational study in which baseline measurements were compared to those obtained 10 to 14 days after stent placement. Measurements and main results: Of 75 referred patients, 58 had severe disease and underwent therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy with stent placement. Mean age was 69 years (range, 39 to 91 years), 34 were men, 33 had COPD, and 13 had asthma. Almost all patients (n 57) had dyspnea as a sole symptom or in combination with cough and recurrent infections; four patients required mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure. In 45 of 58 patients, there was reported symptomatic improvement; quality of life scores improved in 19 of 27 patients (p 0.002); dyspnea scores improved in 22 of 24 patients (p 0.001); functional status scores improved in 18 of 26 patients (p 0.002); and mean exercise capacity improved from baseline, although not significantly. The 49 complications included mainly 21 partial stent obstructions, 14 infections, and 10 stent migrations. Most patients with concomitant COPD also improved on most measures. Conclusions: In the short term, airway stabilization with silicone stents in patients with severe TBM can improve respiratory symptoms, quality of life, and functional status.

Prior studies have suggested that digital drainage systems permit a shorter chest tube duration and hospital length of stay (LOS) by earlier detection of air leak cessation. We conducted a systematic review to assess the impact of digital drainage on chest tube duration and hospital LOS following pulmonary surgery and spontaneous pneumothorax. Methods: Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched from inception through January 2019. We included randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and case series of adult patients using digital or traditional drainage devices for air leaks of either postsurgical or spontaneous pneumothorax origin. Results: Of 1,272 references reviewed, 23 articles were included. Nineteen articles addressed post-operative air leak, while 4 articles pertained to air leak after spontaneous pneumothorax. Thirteen studies were randomized controlled trials. Digital drainage resulted in significantly shorter chest tube duration in 8 of 18 studies and shorter hospital LOS in 6 of 14 studies for post-operative air leak. For postpneumothorax air leak, digital drainage resulted in a significantly shorter chest tube duration in 2 of 3 studies and hospital LOS in 1 of 2 studies with an analog control group. Conclusions: Most studies show no significant differences in chest tube duration and hospital LOS with digital versus analog drainage systems for patients with air leak after pulmonary resection. For post spontaneous pneumothorax air leak, the limited published evidence suggests a shorter chest tube duration and hospital LOS with analog drainage systems.","2020-05","2025-09-01 18:45:17","2025-09-01 18:45:17","2025-09-01 18:45:17","1346-1353","","5","157","","Chest","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/PDSIR8HL/Aldaghlawi et al. - 2020 - A Systematic Review of Digital vs Analog Drainage for Air Leak After Surgical Resection or Spontaneo.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They are performed to facilitate care and promote healing. They also help prevent complications from prolonged endotracheal intubation and malnutrition. In most cases, both are performed simultaneously. Physicians performing them require knowledge of local anatomy, tissue and vascular relationships, along with advance bronchoscopy and endoscopy skills. Although PDTs and PEGs are considered relatively low-risk procedures, operators need to have the knowledge and skill to recognize and prevent adverse outcomes. Current published literature on post-procedural care and stoma wound management was reviewed. Available recommendations for the routine care of tracheostomy and PEG tubes are included in this review. Signs and symptoms of early PDTand PEG-related complications and their management are discussed in detail.

RESULTS: The American Brachytherapy Society consensus guidelines recommend the use of endobronchial brachytherapy for disease palliation in patients with central obstructing lesions, particularly in patients who have previously received external beam radiotherapy. The use of interstitial implants after incomplete resection may improve outcomes and provide enhanced palliation. Early reports support the use of CT-guided intratumoral volume implants within clinical studies. The use of brachytherapy routinely after sublobar resection is not generally recommended, unless within the conﬁnes of a clinical trial or a registry. CONCLUSIONS: American Brachytherapy Society recommendations for thoracic brachytherapy are provided.

In its contemporary form, tracheostomy encompasses both surgical and percutaneous approaches. The primary indications for tracheostomy are centered around ensuring a secure airway in the case of airway compromise or the need for prolonged airway support. While there are only a few absolute contraindications for percutaneous dilation tracheostomies (PDTs), the list of relative contraindications is continually being reevaluated as new data emerges. This review article provides an updated review of percutaneous tracheostomy with more recent literature including studies from the pandemic which saw increased use of percutaneous tracheostomies as well as complications from them. Here we additionally reviewed the most recent literature surrounding of optimal timing and continued lack real world data favoring mortality for early intubation despite further randomized controlled trial testing, including neuro-intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Both surgical and percutaneous methods continue to have their roles, but the percutaneous approach is increasingly favored in the right setting due to factors such as smaller incisions, reduced infection risk, and improved bedside convenience and safety data. Over time the PDT technique has undergone various refinements. One widely utilized method involves employing a single dilator. In this review, practical evidence based guidance is included for the performance of the procedure as well as the aftercare.","2024-12","2025-09-01 18:45:25","2025-09-01 18:45:25","2025-09-01 18:45:25","33-33","","","9","","AME Med J","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/MQV7MNYG/Moore et al. - 2024 - An updated review in percutaneous tracheostomy.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The new procedures introduced in the last decade pose unique challenges, and anesthesiologists need to readapt to their specific demands. In this review, we extensively discuss the pathophysiology, technical aspects, preprocedural preparation, anesthetic management, and postprocedural challenges of many new procedures such as navigational bronchoscopy, endobronchial valve deployment, and bronchial thermoplasty. Majority of these procedures are performed under general anesthesia with an endotracheal tube. Total intravenous anesthesia with rocuronium as a muscle relaxant seems to be the standard US practice. The easy availability and proven safety and efficacy of sugammadex as a reversal agent of rocuronium has decreased the need for high-dose remifentanil as an agent to avoid muscle relaxants. Additional research is available with regard to the utility of nebulized lidocaine and is discussed. Finally, two newer drugs administered for conscious sedation (typically without the need of an anesthesiologist) are likely to gain popularity in the future. Remimazolam is a new short-acting benzodiazepine with a relatively faster offset of clinical effects. Dexmedetomidine, a selective adrenergic agonist, is increasingly employed in bronchoscopy as a sedative during bronchoscopic procedures.","2024-10-29","2025-09-01 18:45:30","2025-09-01 18:45:30","2025-09-01 18:45:30","6471","","21","13","","JCM","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/FJQCYX25/Goudra et al. - 2024 - Anesthesia for Bronchoscopy—An Update.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The test’s performance characteristics in routine clinical practice were evaluated by auditing clinical outcomes of 1613 US patients deemed at high risk for lung cancer by their physician, who ordered the EarlyCDT-Lung test for their patient. Methods: Clinical outcomes for all 1613 patients who provided HIPAA authorization are reported. Clinical data were collected from each patient’s treating physician. Pathology reports when available were reviewed for diagnostic classiﬁcation. Staging was assessed on histology, otherwise on imaging. Results: Six month follow-up for the positives/negatives was 99%/93%. Sixty-one patients (4%) were identiﬁed with lung cancer, 25 of whom tested positive by EarlyCDT-Lung (sensitivity = 41%). A positive EarlyCDT-Lung test on the current panel was associated with a 5.4-fold increase in lung cancer incidence versus a negative. Importantly, 57% (8/14) of non-small cell lung cancers detected as positive (where stage was known) were stage I or II. Conclusions: EarlyCDT-Lung has been extensively tested and validated in case–control settings and has now been shown in this audit to perform in routine clinical practice as predicted.

Pleurodesis with the administration of talc in hospitalized patients is the most common treatment, but indwelling pleural catheters placed for drainage offer an ambulatory alternative. We examined whether talc administered through an indwelling pleural catheter was more effective at inducing pleurodesis than the use of an indwelling pleural catheter alone. METHODS Over a period of 4 years, we recruited patients with malignant pleural effusion at 18 centers in the United Kingdom. After the insertion of an indwelling pleural catheter, patients underwent drainage regularly on an outpatient basis. If there was no evidence of substantial lung entrapment (nonexpandable lung, in which lung expansion and pleural apposition are not possible because of visceral fibrosis or bronchial obstruction) at 10 days, patients were randomly assigned to receive either 4 g of talc slurry or placebo through the indwelling pleural catheter on an outpatient basis. Talc or placebo was administered on a single-blind basis. Follow-up lasted for 70 days. The primary outcome was successful pleurodesis at day 35 after randomization. RESULTS The target of 154 patients undergoing randomization was reached after 584 patients were approached. At day 35, a total of 30 of 69 patients (43%) in the talc group had successful pleurodesis, as compared with 16 of 70 (23%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 2.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.23 to 3.92; P=0.008). No significant between-group differences in effusion size and complexity, number of inpatient days, mortality, or number of adverse events were identified. No significant excess of blockages of the indwelling pleural catheter was noted in the talc group. CONCLUSIONS Among patients without substantial lung entrapment, the outpatient administration of talc through an indwelling pleural catheter for the treatment of malignant pleural effusion resulted in a significantly higher chance of pleurodesis at 35 days than an indwelling catheter alone, with no deleterious effects.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Open-label, randomized clinical trial conducted at 17 UK hospitals. A total of 330 participants were enrolled from August 2012 to April 2018 and followed up until October 2018. Patients were eligible if they were older than 18 years, had a confirmed diagnosis of MPE, and could undergo thoracoscopy with local anesthesia. Patients were excluded if they required a thoracoscopy for diagnostic purposes or had evidence of nonexpandable lung. INTERVENTIONS Patients randomized to the talc poudrage group (n = 166) received 4 g of talc poudrage during thoracoscopy while under moderate sedation, while patients randomized to the control group (n = 164) underwent bedside chest tube insertion with local anesthesia followed by administration of 4 g of sterile talc slurry.

Secondary outcomes included pleurodesis failure at 30 and 180 days; time to pleurodesis failure; number of nights spent in the hospital over 90 days; patient-reported thoracic pain and dyspnea at 7, 30, 90, and 180 days; health-related quality of life at 30, 90, and 180 days; all-cause mortality; and percentage of opacification on chest radiograph at drain removal and at 30, 90, and 180 days. RESULTS Among 330 patients who were randomized (mean age, 68 years; 181 [55%] women), 320 (97%) were included in the primary outcome analysis. At 90 days, the pleurodesis failure rate was 36 of 161 patients (22%) in the talc poudrage group and 38 of 159 (24%) in the talc slurry group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.54-1.55]; P = .74; difference, –1.8% [95% CI, –10.7% to 7.2%]). No statistically significant differences were noted in any of the 24 prespecified secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with malignant pleural effusion, thoracoscopic talc poudrage, compared with talc slurry delivered via chest tube, resulted in no significant difference in the rate of pleurodesis failure at 90 days. However, the study may have been underpowered to detect small but potentially important differences.","2020-01-07","2025-09-01 18:45:50","2025-09-01 18:45:50","2025-09-01 18:45:50","60","","1","323","","JAMA","Effect of Thoracoscopic Talc Poudrage vs Talc Slurry via Chest Tube on Pleurodesis Failure Rate Among Patients With Malignant Pleural Effusions","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/VV5ED7C7/Bhatnagar et al. - 2020 - Effect of Thoracoscopic Talc Poudrage vs Talc Slurry via Chest Tube on Pleurodesis Failure Rate Amon.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Data were extracted from the medical records of a consecutive series of patients with benign airway stenosis secondary to granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) (n = 13), prior tracheotomy or tracheal intubation (n = 8), and idiopathic strictures (n = 5) treated from September 1, 2013, to September 30, 2015, at a tertiary care hospital. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Airway narrowing was quantified on a standard quartile grading scale. Response to treatment was assessed by improvement in airway caliber and the time interval for reintervention. EXPOSURES Delivery of 4 5-second SCT cycles and 2 balloon dilatations. RESULTS Twenty-six patients (median [range] age, 53 [16-83] years; 20 [77%] female) underwent 48 SCT sessions. Spray cryotherapy was successfully used without any substantial intraoperative or postoperative complications in all patients. In a median (range) follow-up of 11 (1-26) months, all patients had improvement in symptoms. Before the institution of SCT, 23 patients (88%) had grade III or IV stenosis. At the last evaluation after induction of SCT, 4 (15%) had grade III or IV stenosis, with a mean (SD) change of 1.39 (0.51) (P < .001). Patients with GPA required significantly fewer SCT procedures (mean [SD], 1.38 [0.96] vs 2.31 [1.18]; P = .03) during the study period. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Spray cryotherapy was a safe adjunct modality to accomplish airway patency in patients with benign tracheal stenosis. Although efficacy evidence is limited for SCT, it may be useful for patients who have experienced treatment failure with conventional modalities. Further analysis of this cohort will determine the physiologic durability of the reported short-term changes. Additional trials are warranted for further evaluation of this modality.","2016-11-01","2025-09-01 18:45:52","2025-09-01 18:45:52","2025-09-01 18:45:52","1082","","11","142","","JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/LCU3GDYZ/Bhora et al. - 2016 - Treatment of Benign Tracheal Stenosis Using Endoluminal Spray Cryotherapy.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Electromagnetic navigation with or without endobronchial ultrasound for diagnosis of the above has been well described. Bronchoscopic Trans Bronchial Access Tool is a novel endoscopic technique that creates a virtual pathway to the lesion and is less limited by location of the airway. The CrossCountryTM Transbronchial Access Tool (CovidienTM, Plymouth, MN, USA) is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved off airway device that utilizes a catheter equipped guide sheath for a transparenchymal approach to a distal lesion. Cone beam computer tomography (CBCT) is a real-time onsite extrathoracic navigational modality used in the bronchoscopy suite that allows for an open working channel. All three of the above modalities can have reasonable diagnostic yields when used independently. While utilizing the above tools we frequently found ourselves in situations where one technique was not enough, prompting the use of a combination of modalities to obtain the most efficient and accurate diagnosis. We are reporting the feasibility and safety of utilizing these three modalities in conjunction with one another. Methods: Patients with peripheral pulmonary nodules on chest computed tomography underwent a navigation bronchoscopy under general anesthesia. CBCT and radial ultrasound was used in every case to confirm navigation to the target lesion. Lesions without definitive airways leading to them were accessed with the transbronchial access tool (TBAT). Results: Electromagnetic bronchoscopy using CBCT and radial US was performed on 22 patients from April 2016 to September 2016. The TBAT tool was used in 7 patients. The overall diagnostic yield was 77.2% (17 of 22). Diagnostic yield of with use TBAT was 100% (7 of 7). There were no complications. Average case length was 79.95 (range, 50–124) minutes and average fluoroscopy time was 10.39 (1–21.7) minutes. Conclusions: TBAT is a useful and safe tool when accessing peripheral pulmonary nodules and is used in conjunctions with electromagnetic navigation and CBCT.","2018-10","2025-09-01 18:45:56","2025-09-01 18:45:56","2025-09-01 18:45:56","5953-5959","","10","10","","J.

The use of a traditional endoscope can be difficult in cases of esophageal stenosis and theoretically confers an increased risk of infection due to its complex architecture. We describe a technique using the bronchoscope, which allows navigation through stenotic esophageal lesions and also minimizes the risk of endoscopy-associated infections. Methods: Prospective series of patients who had PEG tube placement guided by a bronchoscope. Procedural outcomes including successful placement, duration of the entire procedure, time needed for passage of the bronchoscope from the oropharynx to the major curvature, PEG tube removal rate, and mortality were collected. Procedural adverse events, including infections and long-term PEG-related complications, were recorded. Results: A total of 84 patients underwent bronchoscope-guided PEG tube placement. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube insertion was completed successfully in 82 (97.6%) patients. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement was performed immediately following percutaneous tracheostomy in 82.1%. Thirty-day mortality and 1-year mortality were 11.9% and 31%, respectively. Overall, minor complications occurred in 2.4% of patients, while there were no major complications. No serious infectious complications were identified and no endoscope-associated hospital acquired infections were documented. Conclusions: The use of the bronchoscope can be safely and effectively used for PEG tube placement. The use of bronchoscope rather than a gastroscope has several advantages, which include the ease of navigating through complex aerodigestive disorders such as strictures and fistulas as well as decreased health-care utilization. In addition, it may have a theoretical advantage of minimizing infections related to complex endoscopes.","2020-09","2025-09-01 18:46:06","2025-09-01 18:46:06","2025-09-01 18:46:06","851-857","","9","35","","J Intensive Care Med","Bronchoscope-Guided Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy Tube Placement by Interventional Pulmonologists","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/KTW6YUJ2/Folch et al. - 2020 - Bronchoscope-Guided Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy Tube Placement by Interventional Pulmonologi.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We have developed a novel procedure which allows sampling of SPNs via a transparenchymal approach, and report the results from this as a ﬁrst in human trial. Methods This study was a prospective single-arm interventional study. We recruited patients with a SPN detected on CT imaging, which was suspicious for lung cancer, who were suitable for surgical resection. Using the subject’s CT, an optimal airway wall point of entry (POE), and an avascular path through lung tissue from the POE to the SPN was calculated. A tunnel tract was created from the POE to the nodule using a set of catheter-based tools under fused ﬂuoroscopy guidance. The patients proceeded to surgical resection immediately after the biopsy. The participants were followed-up for 6 months after the procedure. The primary endpoint of the study was to evaluate the feasibility to access and biopsy the nodule. Results Twelve patients were recruited, and a tunnel pathway created in 10 patients. There were no adverse events during the procedures. Adequate biopsies were obtained from 10 patients (83%), which correlated with the histological ﬁndings from the surgical resection. Inspection of the resected lobes did not raise any safety concerns and indicated appropriately tunnelled pathways to the nodule.

Our study aims to determine whether the novel combination of bronchoscopic approach and microwave ablation in management of lung nodules is technically feasible, safe and effective. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of a single center experience in electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy microwave ablation in hybrid operating room. Patients had high surgical risks while lung nodules were either proven malignant or radiologically suspicious. Primary endpoints include technical feasibility and safety. Results: Total of 30 lung nodules from 25 patients were treated. Mean nodule size was 15.1 mm, and bronchus directly leads to the nodules (bronchus sign positive) in only half of them. Technical success rate was 100%, although some nodules required double ablation for adequate coverage. Mean minimal ablation margin was 5.51 mm. The mean actual ablation zone volume was −21.4% compared to predicted, likely due to significant tissue contraction ranging from 0–43%. There was no significant heat sink effect. Mean hospital stay was 1.73 days, and only 1 patient stayed for more than 3 days. Complications included pain (13.3%), pneumothorax requiring drainage (6.67%), post-ablation reaction (6.67%), pleural effusion (3.33%) and hemoptysis (3.33%). After median follow up of 12 months, none of the nodules had evidence of progression. Conclusions: Bronchoscopic transbronchial microwave ablation is safe and feasible for treatment of malignant lung nodules.

Meanwhile, local ablation using photodynamic therapy (PDT) has shown increasing promise in the realm of lung cancer treatment. The purpose of this study was to explore an alternative ablation method using PDT with SuperDimension ENB localization in a hybrid operating theater. Methods: Our study includes patients with primary or metastatic lung cancer who underwent PDT via ENB in the hybrid operating room (OR) of National Taiwan University Hospital between January 2016 and January 2017. ENB with the SuperDimension Navigation System (7th edition) was performed before PDT ablation to localize the target lesions. PDT ablation was performed with the assistance of intraoperative Dyna-computed tomography (Dyna-CT). Tumor response was evaluated by CT 3 months after the procedure. Results: Three patients underwent lung interstitial PDT via the aid of ENB during the study period. The mean size of the nodules was 21.3 mm. The mean navigation time was 14.3 minutes. In all cases, the target pulmonary nodule was ablated by PDT successfully. No major procedure-related complications occurred. One patient suffered from skin hypersensitivity one month after the procedure. The follow-up CT showed significant tumor shrinkage for all the patients. They were all discharged without incident a few days after the procedure as scheduled. Conclusions: PDT with SuperDimension ENB guidance in the hybrid OR is a novel and feasible approach to control peripheral lung malignancy.","2018-04","2025-09-01 18:46:27","2025-09-01 18:46:27","2025-09-01 18:46:27","S725-S730","","s6","10","","J.

The management of CAO is dependent on provider training and local resources, which may make the clinical approach and outcomes highly variable. We reviewed the current literature and provided evidence-based recommendations for the management of CAO. METHODS: A multidisciplinary expert panel developed key questions using the Patient, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcomes format and conducted a systematic literature search using MEDLINE (PubMed) and the Cochrane Library. The panel screened references for inclusion and used vetted evaluation tools to assess the quality of included studies and extract data, and graded the level of evidence supporting each recommendation. A modiﬁed Delphi technique was used to reach consensus on recommendations. RESULTS: A total of 9,688 abstracts were reviewed, 150 full-text articles were assessed, and 31 studies were included in the analysis. One good practice statement and 10 graded recommendations were developed. The overall certainty of evidence was very low. CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic bronchoscopy can improve the symptoms, quality of life, and survival of patients with malignant and nonmalignant CAO. Multi-modality therapeutic options, including rigid bronchoscopy with general anesthesia, tumor/tissue debridement, ablation, dilation, and stent placement, should be utilized when appropriate. Therapeutic options and outcomes are dependent on the underlying etiology of CAO. A multidisciplinary approach and shared decision-making with the patient are strongly encouraged.","2025-01","2025-09-01 18:46:29","2025-09-01 18:46:30","2025-09-01 18:46:29","283-295","","1","167","","CHEST","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/YC67TPL8/Mahmood et al. - 2025 - Management of Central Airway Obstruction.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Clinicians are now surrounded by a plethora of different types of systems, but little is known about the way that they work and perform. Thus, we sought to test the performance of the most commonly used chest drainage units under conditions that are relevant to clinical practice. Methods: A pleural space environment simulator was built. Thirty-two units were tested under four clinical scenarios: air leak interpretation during quiet breathing and after obstructed inspiration (−5 to −150 cmH2O), a buildup of negative pressure (−100 cmH2O), a bronchopleural ﬁstula (10 L/min) and the need for effective external suction in the presence of air leakage. Twenty-ﬁve units were “traditional” thoracic drainages, ﬁve were “digital” low-ﬂow/low-vacuum pumps and two were hybrids (a combination of the two). According to the design of the seal and of the suction control, the units were classiﬁed as wet-wet, wet-dry and dry-dry. Results: All wet units showed reverse air ﬂow, with the potential to mimic an air leak when there was none. Ten wet units showed no automatic negative pressure relief features, while ﬁve dry-dry did but were slow to react. Ten wet and ﬁve dry-dry units showed no capability to handle a 10 L/min leak, as they were restrictive to ﬂow (peak pressure up to 55 cmH2O). Only seven dry-suction units were able to maintain the set suction at high airﬂow rates (>20 L/min). Conclusions: Different chest drainage unit designs lead to different performances, some of which may negatively impact patient outcomes. This sounds the call to tailor our clinical practice for the individual patient. A paradigm shift to better understand all components of pleural physiology post-surgical intervention on this relatively neglected topic is needed to improve our daily practice.","2022-09-09","2025-09-01 18:46:31","2025-09-01 18:46:31","2025-09-01 18:46:31","5311","","18","11","","JCM","Chest Drainage Therapy","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/F3VVXNJ4/Antonicelli et al. - 2022 - Chest Drainage Therapy What Comes out of Pandora’s Box Can Affect Patient Outcomes.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Materials and methods: Ninety-nine patients presenting de novo with lung cancer were randomized to receive EBT or XRT. Eleven key symptoms or clinical signs were assessed by clinicians and patient ratings using self-assessment questionnaires were obtained at the same time. The primary endpoints were a comparison of EBT and XRT for symptom relief and acute and late side-effects (palliation) and their effect on patients' functional status and patient-rated QL outcomes. A secondary objective was a comparison of clinician assessments with patient self-reported symptoms. Results: Both treatments produced good levels of symptom relief. They were better for XRT at the expense of more acute morbidity. Late side-effects were similar. The functional status of patients was well maintained and changed similarly with time in both groups. XRT gave a better duration of palliation. Twenty-eight percent of XRT patients required EBT (at a median time of 304 days) whereas 51% of EBT patients subsequently had XRT (at a median of 125 days). There was a signiÆcant modest gain in median survival with initial XRT (287 vs. 250 days). When clinician and patient assessments were compared, doctors were found to underestimate the severity of breathlessness, anorexia, tiredness and nausea. Conclusions: Fractionated XRT is preferred to EBT as an initial treatment in better performance patients because it provides better overall and more sustained palliation with fewer retreatments and a modest gain in survival time. QL assessment is required in the evaluation of palliative treatments because clinicians frequently underestimate the incidence and severity of key symptoms. q 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Historically, distal bronchial stenting within lobar and segmental bronchi has not been amenable to stenting. In addition, there are questionable beneﬁts to stenting small airways. The Atrium iCast stent is a polytetraﬂuoroethylene covered stainless steel balloon deployed stent which can be deployed through a ﬂexible bronchoscope under direct visualization. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility, complications, and long-term impact of using this stent in patients with lobar bronchial stenosis either secondary to malignancy or benign etiologies. Methods: All records of patients who had the placement of an iCast stent were reviewed over 3.5 years. For each patient the age, sex, location, histology, stent size, duration of stent placement, radiographic improvement, and complications were collected. Results: A total of 122 iCast stents were deployed in 38 patients with lobar bronchial stenosis. The average age was 58 years with 50% male. The etiology included 45% malignant and 55% due to benign conditions. In total, 18.5% patients had stents placed in >1 segment. There was an average of 4 procedures per patient with a mean time to stent revision or removal of 85 days. All patients had symptomatic or radiographic improvement.

We developed a new laser probe, the composite-type optical ﬁberscope (COF), which allows accurate laser irradiation of a cancer lesion with simultaneous visualization of the lesion. In this study, we attempted a new endobronchial PDT technique using the new laser probe, and evaluated the eﬀectiveness and feasibility of this novel PDT technique for peripheral lung cancers. Methods: This phase I study was conducted in 7 patients with peripheral lung cancers (primary tumor ≤20 mm in diameter). We performed endobronchial PDT for these patients using the new laser probe and talaporﬁn sodium as the photosensitizer. Results: We performed PDT for 3 patients with peripheral lung cancer using a laser dose of 50 J/cm2 at 120 mW, and conﬁrmed the feasibility of using this dose. Then, we escalated the laser dose to 100 J/cm2 in 4 additional patients. A total of 7 patients met our inclusion criteria. Evaluation at 2 weeks and 3 months after the PDT revealed no complication such as pneumonia or pneumothorax. At the evaluation conducted 6 months later, we found CR in 3 cases and SD in the remaining 4 cases. Conclusion: PDT was found to be a feasible and non-invasive treatment modality for early peripheral-type lung cancer. In the future, PDT could become a standard treatment option for peripheral-type lung cancer.","2020-06","2025-09-01 18:46:39","2025-09-01 18:46:39","2025-09-01 18:46:39","101698","","","30","","Photodiagnosis and Photodynamic Therapy","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/KCDA4HF8/Usuda et al. - 2020 - Clinical trial of photodynamic therapy for peripheral-type lung cancers using a new laser device in.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A bronchial genomic classiﬁer was previously validated to identify patients at low risk for lung cancer after an inconclusive bronchoscopy. In this study, we evaluated the potential of the classiﬁer to reduce invasive procedure utilization in patients with suspected lung cancer. METHODS: In two multicenter trials of patients undergoing bronchoscopy for suspected lung cancer, the classiﬁer was measured in normal-appearing bronchial epithelial cells from a mainstem bronchus. Among patients with low and intermediate pretest probability of cancer (n ¼ 222), subsequent invasive procedures after an inconclusive bronchoscopy were identiﬁed. Estimates of the ability of the classiﬁer to reduce unnecessary procedures were calculated. RESULTS: Of the 222 patients, 188 (85%) had an inconclusive bronchoscopy and follow-up procedure data available for analysis. Seventy-seven (41%) patients underwent an additional 99 invasive procedures, which included surgical lung biopsy in 40 (52%) patients. Benign and malignant diseases were ultimately diagnosed in 62 (81%) and 15 (19%) patients, respectively. Among those undergoing surgical biopsy, 20 (50%) were performed in patients with benign disease. If the classiﬁer had been used to guide decision making, procedures could have been avoided in 50% (21 of 42) of patients undergoing further invasive testing. Further, among 35 patients with an inconclusive index bronchoscopy who were diagnosed with lung cancer, the sensitivity of the classiﬁer was 89%, with 4 (11%) patients having a false-negative classiﬁer result. CONCLUSIONS: Invasive procedures after an inconclusive bronchoscopy occur frequently, and most are performed in patients ultimately diagnosed with benign disease. Using the genomic classiﬁer as an adjunct to bronchoscopy may reduce the frequency and associated morbidity of these invasive procedures.","2016-07","2025-09-01 18:46:40","2025-09-01 18:46:40","2025-09-01 18:46:40","210-218","","1","150","","Chest","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/99DJZUI8/Vachani et al. - 2016 - Clinical Utility of a Bronchial Genomic Classifier in Patients With Suspected Lung Cancer.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, endobrochial brachytherapy was introduced to extend the duration of palliation and reduce the number of endoscopic treatments. This trial compares Nd-YAG laser alone and associated to high dose rated (HDR)-brachytherapy. Patients and Methods: From 1995 to 1998, 29 consecutive patients, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and central airway involvement, were randomized in two groups: group 1 (15 patients) received Nd-YAG laser only; group 2 (14 patients) underwent a combined Nd-YAG laser/ HDR brachytherapy treatment. Results: There was no mortality or morbidity related to the treatment. The period free from symptoms was 2.8 months for group 1 and increased to 8.5 months in group 2 (PB 0.05). The disease’s progression free period grew from 2.2 months of group 1 to 7.5 months of group 2 (PB 0.05) and the number of further endoscopic treatment reduced from 15 to 3 (PB0.05). Conclusion: The results conﬁrm the potential of brachytherapy to prolong relief from symptoms, lessen disease progression and reduce costs of treatment.

Two types of valves are established in clinical practice: Zephyr endobronchial valves (EBVs) and Spiration Valve System (SVS). We aimed to compare outcomes and the safety associated with these two types of one-way valves. Methods: Data were collected from three German lung emphysema centers as part of a prospective observational study focusing on lung volume reduction. Two groups were formed based on valve types. In both groups, lung function (FEV<sub>1</sub>, RV, diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, pCO<sub>2</sub>), 6-min walking distance (6MWD), quality of life (SGRQ, mMRC, CAT), and complication rate were recorded at baseline and at follow-up 3 to 6 months later. Results: A total of 54 patients were treated with SVS valves and 99 patients with EBV. There were no significant differences between both groups at baseline. Notably, both types of valves exhibited significant enhancements in lung function and quality of life. Interestingly, there were no significant differences in the median change of all measured parameters for both groups, suggesting comparable improvements in EBV and SVS. Pneumothorax was the most common complication for both valve types. The incidence of adverse events did not differ significantly between groups. Conclusion: Our study suggests that both types of valves are safe and effective in the treatment of severe lung emphysema. We recommend choosing the valve type based on individual bronchial anatomy. However, further randomized studies are needed to confirm our results.","2024-11-25","2025-09-01 18:46:50","2025-09-01 18:46:50","2025-09-01 18:46:50","281-289","","4","104","","Respiration","","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/Y7DXKKUU/Sgarbossa et al. - 2024 - Comparison of Efficacy and Safety of Different Types of One-Way Valves in Endoscopic Lung Volume Red.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Different treatment approaches are unilateral valve placement with the goal of complete occlusion and subsequent atelectasis leading to true volume reduction vs bilateral partial closure aiming for redistribution of ventilation but avoiding atelectasis. In this prospective pilot trial, we compared the efﬁﬁcacy of these treatment approaches. Methods: Patients with severe bilateral heterogeneous emphysema were randomized to two groups. In the ﬁﬁrst group, patients received unilateral valves aiming for total occlusion of one lobe. In the other group, valves were placed in two contralateral lobes with incomplete closure. In all cases, one-way valves were placed via a ﬂﬂexible bronchoscope. Patients were followed at 30 and 90 days, end points being change in pulmonary function tests (PFTs), 6-min walk distance (6MWD), and dyspnea score as measured by the modiﬁﬁed Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea score, as well as quality of life as measured by the St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Results: Twenty-two patients were treated in this study, 11 patients in each arm. At 30 days and 90 days, signiﬁﬁcant differences were seen in PFT and 6MWD, as well as in mMRC and SGRQ scores, in favor of unilateral treatment. At 90 days, FEV1 was improved by 21.4% 10.7% in this group, but not in the bilateral group (20.03% 13.9%, P 5 .002). One patient in the unilateral group experienced a pneumothorax, and two patients in the bilateral group were treated for transient respiratory failure. Conclusions: Unilateral intrabronchial valve placement with complete occlusion appears superior to bilateral partial occlusion.

Relatively few studies have compared how these approaches affect the incidence of complications. METHODS: We used the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) Quality Improvement Registry, Evaluation, and Education (AQuIRE) program registry to conduct a multicenter study of patients undergoing therapeutic bronchoscopy for malignant central airway obstruction. The primary outcome was the incidence of complications. Secondary outcomes were incidence of bleeding, hypoxemia, respiratory failure, adverse events, escalation in level of care, and 30-day mortality. RESULTS: Fifteen centers performed 1,115 procedures on 947 patients. There were significant differences among centers in the type of anesthesia (moderate vs deep or general anesthesia, P , .001), use of rigid bronchoscopy (P , .001), type of ventilation (jet vs volume cycled, P , .001), and frequency of stent use (P , .001). The overall complication rate was 3.9%, but significant variation was found among centers (range, 0.9%-11.7%; P 5 .002). Risk factors for complications were urgent and emergent procedures, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score . 3, redo therapeutic bronchoscopy, and moderate sedation. The 30-day mortality was 14.8%; mortality varied among centers (range, 7.7%-20.2%, P 5 .02).

Surgical airways can be achieved either through a cricothyroidotomy or tracheostomy. The current literature has limited data regarding complications of cricothyroidotomy and tracheostomy in an emergency situation. The objective of this systematic review is to analyze complications following cricothyroidotomy and tracheostomy in airway emergencies. Methods: This synthesis of literature was exempt from ethics approval. Eight databases were searched from inception to October 2018, using a comprehensive search strategy. Studies were included if they were randomized controlled trials or observational studies reporting complications following emergency surgical airway. Complications were classified as minor (evolving to spontaneous remission or not requiring intervention or not persisting chronically), major (requiring intervention or persisting chronically), early (from the start of the procedure up to 7 days) and late (beyond 7 days of the procedure). Results: We retrieved 2659 references from our search criteria. Following the removal of duplicates, title and abstract review, 33 articles were selected for full-text reading. Twenty-one articles were finally included in the systematic review. We found no differences in minor, major or early complications between the two techniques. However, late complications were significantly more frequent in the tracheostomy group [OR (95% CI) 0.21 (0.20–0.22), p < 0.0001]. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that cricothyroidotomies performed in emergent situations resulted in fewer late complications than tracheostomies. This finding supports the recommendations from the latest Difficult Airway Society (DAS) guidelines regarding using cricothyroidotomy as the technique of choice for emergency surgical airway. However, emergency cricothyroidotomies should be converted to tracheostomies in a timely fashion as there is insufficient evidence to suggest that emergency cricothyrotomies are long term airways.","2020-12","2025-09-01 18:47:01","2025-09-01 18:47:01","2025-09-01 18:47:01","216","","1","20","","BMC Anesthesiol","Complications of cricothyroidotomy versus tracheostomy in emergency surgical airway management","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/6RQKSQBE/Zasso et al. - 2020 - Complications of cricothyroidotomy versus tracheostomy in emergency surgical airway management a sy.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Data on prospectively enrolled patients undergoing EBUS-TBNA in the American College of Chest Physicians Quality Improvement Registry, Evaluation, and Education (AQuIRE) database were extracted and analyzed for the incidence, consequences, and predictors of complications. Results: We enrolled 1,317 patients at six hospitals. Complications occurred in 19 patients (1.44%; 95% CI, 0.87%-2.24%).

More recently, CBCT has emerged as an important imaging tool for bronchoscopists, primarily used during transbronchial biopsy of peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLS). For this application CBCT has proved useful in navigating devices to a target lesion, in confirming device tool-in-lesion, as well as during tissue acquisition. In addition, CBCT is poised to play an important role in trials evaluating bronchoscopic ablation by helping to determine the location of the ablative probe relative to the target lesion. Before adopting this technology, it is key for bronchoscopists to learn some basic concepts that will allow them to have a safer and more successful experience with CBCT. Hence, in the current manuscript, we will focus on both technical and practical aspects of CBCT imaging, ranging from systems considerations, image quality, radiation dose and dose-reduction strategies, procedure room set-up, and best practices for CBCT image acquisition.","2020-12","2025-09-01 18:47:10","2025-09-01 18:47:10","2025-09-01 18:47:10","7416-7428","","12","12","","J Thorac Dis","Cone beam CT imaging for bronchoscopy","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/WDMIC3K4/Setser et al. - 2020 - Cone beam CT imaging for bronchoscopy a technical review.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is a lack of comparative studies of such platforms using CBCT guidance to overcome computed tomography to body divergence. The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic yield of ENB- and ssRAB-guided CBCT for biopsy of pulmonary nodules. Methods: We conducted a retrospective comparative study of consecutive patients undergoing ENBCBCT and ssRAB-CBCT. Navigational success was defined as biopsy tool within lesion confirmed during CBCT. Diagnostic yield was assessed using two methods: (I) presence of malignancy or benign histological findings that lead to a specific diagnosis at the time of bronchoscopy, and (II) longitudinal follow-up of patients with nonspecific benign finding during bronchoscopy. Results: ENB-CBCT was used to biopsy 97 nodules and ssRAB-CBCT was used to biopsy 111 nodules. Median size of the lesion for the ENB-CBCT group was 16.5 mm [interquartile range (IQR), 12–22 mm] as compared to 12 mm (IQR, 9–16 mm) in the ssRAB-CBCT group (P<0.001).

METHODS In this open-label, multicenter, noninferiority trial, we recruited patients 14 to 50 years of age with a first-known, unilateral, moderate-to-large primary spontaneous pneumothorax. Patients were randomly assigned to immediate interventional management of the pneumothorax (intervention group) or a conservative observational approach (conservative-management group) and were followed for 12 months. The primary outcome was lung reexpansion within 8 weeks. RESULTS A total of 316 patients underwent randomization (154 patients to the intervention group and 162 to the conservative-management group). In the conservativemanagement group, 25 patients (15.4%) underwent interventions to manage the pneumothorax, for reasons prespecified in the protocol, and 137 (84.6%) did not undergo interventions. In a complete-case analysis in which data were not available for 23 patients in the intervention group and 37 in the conservative-management group, reexpansion within 8 weeks occurred in 129 of 131 patients (98.5%) with interventional management and in 118 of 125 (94.4%) with conservative management (risk difference, −4.1 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], −8.6 to 0.5; P=0.02 for noninferiority); the lower boundary of the 95% confidence interval was within the prespecified noninferiority margin of −9 percentage points. In a sensitivity analysis in which all missing data after 56 days were imputed as treatment failure (with reexpansion in 129 of 138 patients [93.5%] in the intervention group and in 118 of 143 [82.5%] in the conservative-management group), the risk difference of −11.0 percentage points (95% CI, −18.4 to −3.5) was outside the prespecified noninferiority margin. Conservative management resulted in a lower risk of serious adverse events or pneumothorax recurrence than interventional management. CONCLUSIONS Although the primary outcome was not statistically robust to conservative assumptions about missing data, the trial provides modest evidence that conservative management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax was noninferior to interventional management, with a lower risk of serious adverse events.

We sought to evaluate the current practice patterns in the management of exudative pleural effusion in the interventional pulmonary (IP) community. Methods: A questionnaire was developed and was disseminated to all listed American Association of Bronchology and Interventional Pulmonology (AABIP) members. Survey addressed the approach to the management of recurrent exudative pleural effusions with emphasis on the roles of Semi-rigid and rigid thoracoscopy. Results: Of 388 members who opened the survey, 165 (43%) completed it. The majority were interventional pulmonologists representing academic and private practice in the United States (US), with approximately one third of respondents from other countries. Almost two thirds (61%) of them perform thoracoscopy. For those who do perform thoracoscopy, 93% would perform thoracoscopy for recurrent undiagnosed exudate. Equal numbers perform rigid and semi-rigid thoracoscopy and 31 (44%) perform both procedures, there was no statistically significant difference. There was a slight preference for Semirigid thoracoscopy although opinion was skewed slightly in favor of rigid thoracoscopy when asked about diagnostic yield. TPCs play a large role in management patterns, sometimes without and sometimes after thoracoscopy, 59% of the respondents chose a TPC alone for the management of known malignant effusion, while a 16% would combine it with MT (P value <0.0001). Conclusions: Thoracoscopy is accepted as the diagnostic procedure of choice for undiagnosed exudative effusion. TPCs play a dominant role in management even when thoracoscopy is performed.","2018-06","2025-09-01 18:47:26","2025-09-01 18:47:26","2025-09-01 18:47:26","3874-3878","","6","10","","J. Thorac.

The PEG complication rate varies from 0.4% to 22.5% of cases, with minor complications being three times more frequent. Buried bumper syndrome (BBS) is a severe complication of this method, in which the internal fixation device migrates alongside the tract of the stoma outside the stomach. Excessive compression of tissue between the external and internal fixation device of the gastrostomy tube is considered the main etiological factor leading to BBS. Incidence of BBS is estimated at around 1% (0.3%-2.4%). Inability to insert, loss of patency and leakage around the PEG tube are considered to be a typical symptomatic triad. Gastroscopy is indicated in all cases in which BBS is suspected. The depth of disc migration in relation to the lamina muscularis propria of the stomach is critical for further therapy and can be estimated by endoscopic or transabdominal ultrasound. BBS can be complicated by gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation, peritonitis, intra-abdominal and abdominal wall abscesses, or phlegmon, and these complications can lead to fatal outcomes. The most important preventive measure is adequate positioning of the external bolster. A conservative approach should be applied only in patients with high operative risk and dismal prognosis. Choice of the method of release is based on the type of the PEG set and depth of disc migration. A disc retained inside the stomach and completely covered by the overgrowing tissue can be released using some type of endoscopic dissection technique (needle knife, argon plasma coagulation, or papillotome through the cannula). Proper patient selection and dissection of the overgrowing tissue are the major determinants for successful endoscopic therapy. A disc localized out of the stomach (lamina muscularis propria) should be treated by a surgeon.","2016","2025-09-01 18:47:28","2025-09-01 18:47:28","2025-09-01 18:47:28","618","","2","22","","WJG","Buried bumper syndrome","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/LBFU4LJ2/Cyrany - 2016 - Buried bumper syndrome A complication of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design Unblinded randomized controlled trial (Second Therapeutic Intervention in Malignant Effusion Trial [TIME2]) comparing IPC and talc (1:1) for which 106 patients with malignant pleural effusion who had not previously undergone pleurodesis were recruited from 143 patients who were treated at 7 UK hospitals. Patients were screened from April 2007-February 2011 and were followed up for a year. Intervention Indwelling pleural catheters were inserted on an outpatient basis, followed by initial large volume drainage, education, and subsequent home drainage. The talc group were admitted for chest tube insertion and talc for slurry pleurodesis. Main Outcome Measure Patients completed daily 100-mm line visual analog scale (VAS) of dyspnea over 42 days after undergoing the intervention (0 mm represents no dyspnea and 100 mm represents maximum dyspnea; 10 mm represents minimum clinically significant difference). Mean difference was analyzed using a mixed-effects linear regression model adjusted for minimization variables. Results Dyspnea improved in both groups, with no significant difference in the first 42 days with a mean VAS dyspnea score of 24.7 in the IPC group (95% CI, 19.3-30.1 mm) and 24.4 mm (95% CI, 19.4-29.4 mm) in the talc group, with a difference of 0.16 mm (95% CI, −6.82 to 7.15; P=.96). There was a statistically significant improvement in dyspnea in the IPC group at 6 months, with a mean difference in VAS score between the IPC group and the talc group of −14.0 mm (95% CI, −25.2 to −2.8 mm; P=.01). Length of initial hospitalization was significantly shorter in the IPC group with a median of 0 days (interquartile range [IQR], 0-1 day) and 4 days (IQR, 2-6 days) for the talc group, with a difference of −3.5 days (95% CI, −4.8 to −1.5 days; P .001). There was no significant difference in quality of life. Twelve patients (22%) in the talc group required further pleural procedures compared with 3 (6%) in the IPC group (odds ratio [OR], 0.21; 95% CI, 0.040.86; P=.03). Twenty-one of the 52 patients in the catheter group experienced adverse events vs 7 of 54 in the talc group (OR, 4.70; 95% CI, 1.75-12.60; P=.002).

We investigated the feasibility, safety and efﬁcacy of LVR coil treatment in a prospective multicentre cohort trial in patients with severe emphysema. Methods Patients were treated in 11 centres. Safety was evaluated by recording all adverse events, efﬁcacy by the St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) as primary endpoint, and pulmonary function testing, modiﬁed Medical Research Council dyspnoea score (mMRC) and 6-min walk distance (6MWD) up to 12 months after the ﬁnal treatment. Results Sixty patients (60.9 ± 7.5 years, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) 30.2 ± 6.3% pred) were bronchoscopically treated with coils (55 bilateral, 5 unilateral), with a median of 10 (range 5–15) coils per lobe. Within 30 days post-treatment, seven chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations (6.1%), six pneumonias (5.2%), four pneumothoraces (3.5%) and one haemoptysis (0.9%) occurred as serious adverse events. At 6 and 12 months, respectively, ΔSGRQ was −12.1±12.9 and −11.1±13.3 points, Δ6MWD was +29.7±74.1 m and +51.4±76 m, ΔFEV1 was +0.11 ±0.20 L and +0.11±0.30 L, and ΔRV (residual volume) was −0.65±0.90 L and −0.71±0.81 L (all p<0.01). Post hoc analyses showed signiﬁcant responses for SGRQ, 6MWD and RV in patients with both heterogeneous and homogeneous emphysema.

SpO2 values, heart rate (HR), systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), patients' cough scores and discomfort scores as determined by patients and bronchoscopists, levels of sedation, number of times that additional lidocaine was required, elapsed time until recovery, and adverse events were recorded. The mean SpO2 values in the DF group were significantly higher than those in the PF group (P<0.01), and HR, SBP and DBP were significantly lower in the DF group than in the PF group (P<0.05). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of cough scores or discomfort scores, sedation levels, or number of times that additional lidocaine was required (P>0.05).

Recently, EBUS elastography has been introduced as a complementary modality in the evaluation of intrathoracic lymphadenopathy. We evaluated the ability of EBUS elastography to differentiate between benign and malignant LNs. Methods: A prospective study was conducted on patients sent for evaluation of intrathoracic lymphadenopathy. LNs were classiﬁed qualitatively according to elastographic colour pattern: type 1, predominantly non-blue; type 2, partly blue, partly non-blue and type 3, predominantly blue. Quantitative elastography of LNs was measured by the strain ratio (SR). Qualitative and quantitative elastographies were compared for the ﬁnal diagnosis of LNs. Results: There were 120 LNs from 72 patients who underwent EBUS elastography. The ﬁnal diagnosis included 96 malignant and 24 benign LNs. All of the 16 type 1 LNs proved to be benign diseases, while 95 of the 101 type 3 LNs were ﬁnally diagnosed as malignancies. Three LNs classiﬁed as type 2 proved to be two benign and one malignant. Malignant LNs presented a higher median SR than benign LNs (73.50 vs 1.29, P = 0.001). An SR of >2.5 and non-type 1 elastographic pattern achieved similar diagnostic performance in benign/malignant differentiation (sensitivity, 100% vs 100%; speciﬁcity, 70.8% vs 66.7%; positive predictive value, 93.2% vs 92.3%; negative predictive value, 100% vs 100%).

The diagnostic yield and bleeding complications associated with bronchoscopic biopsy of bronchial carcinoid tumors remain unclear. Materials and Methods: Patients with bronchial carcinoid tumors that were bronchoscopically visualized and biopsied at our tertiary referral medical center, over an 8-year period from 2010 to 2017, were retrospectively identiﬁed and reviewed to assess diagnostic yield and bleeding complications. Correlations with patient characteristics and carcinoid tumor features were analyzed. Results: Forty-nine patients were included (57% female). Tumors were predominantly (71%) located in proximal airways (mainstem and lobar bronchi). Bronchoscopic biopsy was diagnostic in 45 patients (92%). Thirteen patients (27%) experienced moderate (n = 12, 25%) or severe (n = 1, 2%) bleeding. Among these, 6 tumors (46%) had a vascular appearance and 4 patients (31%) had experienced recent hemoptysis. However, neither vascularity nor hemoptysis was associated with bleeding at biopsy (P = 0.68 and 0.73, respectively). Carcinoid tumors were classiﬁed as typical in 79% and atypical in 21% with no difference in diagnostic yield or bleeding risk (P = 0.28 and 0.92, respectively). Tumor size was also not associated with increased diagnostic yield or bleeding risk (P = 0.54 and 0.39, respectively). Conclusion: Bronchoscopic biopsy of endobronchial carcinoid is associated with a high diagnostic yield and severe bleeding is rarely encountered. Diagnostic yield and bleeding seemed independent of vascular tumor appearance or history of recent hemoptysis.","2020-07","2025-09-01 18:47:45","2025-09-01 18:47:45","2025-09-01 18:47:45","184-189","","3","27","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/MK69Z3HL/Gao et al. - 2020 - Diagnostic Yield and Bleeding Complications Associated With Bronchoscopic Biopsy of Endobronchial Ca.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This systematic review analyses the diagnostic yield and safety of navigation bronchoscopy for the diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary nodules suspected of lung cancer. Methods: An extensive search was performed in Embase, Medline and Cochrane CENTRAL in May 2022. Eligible studies used cone-beam CT-guided navigation (CBCT), electromagnetic navigation (EMN), robotic navigation (RB) or virtual bronchoscopy (VB) as the primary navigation technique. Primary outcomes were diagnostic yield and adverse events. Quality of studies was assessed using QUADAS-2. Random effects meta-analysis was performed, with subgroup analyses for different navigation techniques, newer versus older techniques, nodule size, publication year, and strictness of diagnostic yield definition. Explorative analyses of subgroups reported by studies was performed for nodule size and bronchus sign. Results: A total of 95 studies (n = 10,381 patients; n = 10,682 nodules) were included. The majority (n = 63; 66.3%) had high risk of bias or applicability concerns in at least one QUADAS-2 domain. Summary diagnostic yield was 70.9% (95%-CI 68.4%-73.2%). Overall pneumothorax rate was 2.5%. Newer navigation techniques using advanced imaging and/or robotics (CBCT, RB, tomosynthesis guided EMN; n = 24 studies) had a statistically significant higher diagnostic yield compared to longer established techniques (EMN, VB; n = 82 studies): 77.5% (95%-CI 74.7%-80.1%) vs 68.8% (95%-CI 65.9%-71.6%) (p < 0.001). Explorative subgroup analyses showed that larger nodule size and bronchus sign presence were associated with a statistically significant higher diagnostic yield. Other subgroup analyses showed no significant differences. Conclusion: Navigation bronchoscopy is a safe procedure, with the potential for high diagnostic yield, in particular using newer techniques such as RB, CBCT and tomosynthesis-guided EMN. Studies showed a large amount of heterogeneity, making comparisons difficult. Standardized definitions for outcomes with relevant clinical context will improve future comparability.","2023-06","2025-09-01 18:47:47","2025-09-01 18:47:47","2025-09-01 18:47:47","107196","","","180","","Lung Cancer","Diagnostic yield and safety of navigation bronchoscopy","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/F2BNDVAL/Kops et al. - 2023 - Diagnostic yield and safety of navigation bronchoscopy A systematic review and meta-analysis.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, its efficiency in diagnosis of sarcoidosis when combined with endobronchial biopsy (EBB) and transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) has not been studied. This randomized controlled trial compares diagnostic yield of EBUS-TBNA vs cTBNA in combination with EBB and TBLB. METHODS: Patients with clinical diagnosis of sarcoidosis were randomized 1:1 to EBUS-TBNA or cTBNA. All patients underwent TBLB and EBB. The primary outcome was detection of granulomas. The secondary end points were the individual and cumulative yields of various procedures, serious adverse events, and procedure time. RESULTS: Of the 130 patients, sarcoidosis was diagnosed in 117 (62 cTBNA, 55 EBUS-TBNA). The two groups were similar at baseline. Granulomas were demonstrated in 104 (53 cTBNA, 51 EBUS-TBNA) patients and were similar in two groups (85.5% vs 92.7%, P 5 .34). Individually, EBUS-TBNA had the highest yield (41 of 55, 74.5%), which was better than cTBNA (30 of 62, 48.4%, P 5 .004) or EBB (40 of 111, 36.3%, P , .0001) but not TBLB (78 of 112, 69.6%, P 5 .54). Adding EBB/TBLB to cTBNA led to an increase in granuloma detection, whereas the addition of TBLB (but not EBB) significantly enhanced the yield of EBUS-TBNA. The procedure time was significantly longer with EBUS-TBNA. No major adverse events occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Individually, EBUS-TBNA has the highest diagnostic yield in sarcoidosis, but it should be combined with TBLB for the optimal yield. The diagnostic yield of cTBNA (plus EBB and TBLB) is similar to EBUS-TBNA plus TBLB.","2014-09","2025-09-01 18:47:57","2025-09-01 18:47:58","2025-09-01 18:47:57","547-556","","3","146","","Chest","","","","","","","","en","https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/EFINPUSN/Gupta et al. - 2014 - Endobronchial Ultrasound-Guided Transbronchial Needle Aspiration vs Conventional Transbronchial Need.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aims of this study were to investigate the diagnostic value of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography for distinguishing the difference between benign and malignant lymph nodes among mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes. Materials and Methods: From June 2015 to August 2015, 47 patients confirmed of mediastinal and hilar lymph node enlargement through examination of Computed tomography (CT) were enrolled, and a total of 78 lymph nodes were evaluated by endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA). EBUS-guided elastography of lymph nodes was performed prior to EBUS-TBNA. A convex probe EBUS was used with a new EBUS processor to assess elastographic patterns that were classified based on color distribution as follows: Type 1, predominantly non-blue (green, yellow and red); Type 2, part blue, part non-blue (green, yellow and red); Type 3, predominantly blue. Pathological determination of malignant or benign lymph nodes was used as the gold standard for this study. The elastographic patterns were compared with the final pathologic results from EBUS-TBNA. Results: On pathological evaluation of the lymph nodes, 45 were benign and 33 were malignant. The lymph nodes that were classified as Type 1 on endobronchial ultrasound elastography were benign in 26/27 (96.3%) and malignant in 1/27 (3.7%); for Type 2 lymph nodes, 15/20 (75.0%) were benign and 5/20 (25.0%) were malignant; Type 3 lymph nodes were benign in 4/31 (12.9%) and malignant in 27/31 (87.1%). In classifying Type 1 as ‘benign’ and Type 3 as ‘malignant,’ the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and diagnostic accuracy rates were 96.43%, 86.67%, 87.10%, 96.30%, 91.38%, respectively. Conclusion: EBUS elastography of mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes is a noninvasive technique that can be performed reliably and may be helpful in the prediction of benign and malignant lymph nodes among mediastinal and hilar lymph node during EBUS-TBNA.","2017","2025-09-01 18:48:03","2025-09-01 18:48:04","2025-09-01 18:48:03","1843-1848","","10","8","","J.

Follow-up assessments were conducted to determine the clinical efficacy and safety of the interventions, with survival and quality of life as the primary endpoints. Results: By the end of the follow-up, 98 of 111 patients (88.3%) had died, leaving 13 survivors (11.7%). Patients with esophageal cancer-associated AEF had an overall mean survival time of 147.4 (95% CI, 123.9–170.9) days. Patients in the stent placement group had a mean survival of 192.5 (95% CI, 151.2–233.7) days, which was significantly longer than the 110.0 (95% CI, 88.1–131.8) days in the conservative treatment group (p < 0.001). Sex (p = 0.017), tumor stage (p = 0.030), surgery (p = 0.005), pulmonary infection (p < 0.001), fistula size (p < 0.001), and pre-Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) (p < 0.001) were the independent risk factors affecting survival. Furthermore, patients in the stent placement group demonstrated improved KPS scores post-treatment, increasing from 48.2 to 57.9 (p = 0.017). Conclusion: Airway stent placement is beneficial in alleviating the symptoms, quality of life, and survival of patients with esophageal cancer-associated AEF.","2025-02-17","2025-09-01 18:48:05","2025-09-01 18:48:05","2025-09-01 18:48:05","476-484","","7","104","","Respiration","","","","","","","","en","https://karger.com/pages/terms-and-conditions","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/9WIFZ7N3/Li et al. - 2025 - Efficacy and Safety of Airway Stent Placement in the Treatment of Airway Esophageal Fistula.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We carried out the meta-analysis for assessing the efficacy and safety of CBCT-guided bronchoscopy for PPLs. Methods: An extensive search in several databases was conducted to identify relevant articles. We evaluated the quality of studies with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. The pooled diagnostic yield (DY) and adverse event rate with the 95% confidence interval (CI) were computed. Subgroup analyses were performed according to additional use of navigation, use of radial endobronchial ultrasound (rEBUS), use of fixed or mobile CBCT, whether computed tomography (CT) spin was performed before biopsy to affirm tool-in-lesion, use of rapid onsite cytologic examination (ROSE), strictness of the definition of DY, and study design. Further analysis was performed to explore the association between odds of diagnosis with CBCT guided bronchoscopy and PPLs characteristics (>20 vs. ≤20 mm, non-upper lobe vs. upper lobe, with bronchus sign vs. without bronchus sign, and solid vs. non-solid) as well as sampling methods (forceps vs. fine needle aspiration, forceps vs. cryoprobe sampling). The pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI were calculated. The significance level was set at 0.05. All analyses were performed by using meta package in R version 4.3.2. Results: We included 23 studies involving 1,769 patients and 1,863 PPLs in the meta-analysis. The overall pooled DY of CBCT-guided bronchoscopy was 80.2% (95% CI: 76.0–84.1%). Subgroup analysis showed that the DY was highest when CBCT was used with robotic-assisted navigation bronchoscopy (pooled DY 87.5%; 95% CI: 81.5–92.4%), the DY was 78.9% (95% CI: 70.8–85.9%) when CBCT was used alone without other navigation techniques. Lesion size >20 mm, presence of bronchus sign and solid lesions were associated with significant increase in the odds of diagnosis with CBCT-guided bronchoscopy. Pooled adverse event rate was 2.3% (95% CI: 1.2–3.6%). Conclusions: CBCT-guided bronchoscopy is a safe technique with high DY in diagnosing PPLs. ^ ORCID: Ziling Li, 0000-0001-5309-722X; Shuyun Xu, 0000-0002-2647-754X; Yong Zhang, 0000-0003-2593-1277; Jing Shi, 0009-00049767-3486.","2025-02","2025-09-01 18:48:07","2025-09-01 18:48:07","2025-09-01 18:48:07","551-563","","2","17","","J Thorac Dis","Efficacy and safety of cone-beam computed tomography-guided bronchoscopy for peripheral pulmonary lesions","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/E3GXP5UU/Li et al. - 2025 - Efficacy and safety of cone-beam computed tomography-guided bronchoscopy for peripheral pulmonary le.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Clinicians performing bronchoscopy have utilized various forms of navigation technology ranging from fluoroscopy or computed tomography (CT)-aided guidance in earlier years, now to virtual bronchoscopy and real-time tracking using electromagnetic navigation (EMN) platforms. EMN bronchoscopy relies on a pre-procedural CT of the chest to create a three-dimensional (3D) virtual airway map. This approach is utilized for diagnostic sampling of lung and mediastinal lesions, placement of fiducial markers, or dye marking of the overlying pleura. The diagnostic yield, using this technology, is superior to conventional bronchoscopy techniques and is discussed. The respiratory motion of the airways, lung, and nodule hysteresis creates unique challenges for targeting the lesion. Use of fluoroscopy and radial-probe ultrasound provide meaningful information and additional confirmation with difficult lesions. We continue to evolve in our understanding of how best to utilize the technology, modify diagnostic tools, and improve nextgeneration platforms. Even so, EMN bronchoscopy has changed the landscape of tissue acquisition for peripheral lung lesions. This review provides important principles and practical aspects of pre-procedure preparation, assessment of airway-lesion relationships, procedural workflow and performance, and points for consideration when contemplating acquisition of an EMN system. The future is in development of intuitive platforms that will allow consistent targeting with higher accuracy so ablation techniques could be performed safely via the endobronchial approach.","2018-12","2025-09-01 18:48:10","2025-09-01 18:48:10","2025-09-01 18:48:10","117-117","","","3","","AME Med.

Methods: NAVIGATE is a prospective, multicenter study of the superDimension™ navigation system. A prespecified 1-month interim analysis of the first 1,000 primary cohort subjects enrolled at 29 sites in the United States and Europe is described. Enrollment and 24-month follow-up are ongoing. Results: ENB index procedures were conducted for lung lesion biopsy (n = 964), fiducial marker placement (n = 210), pleural dye marking (n = 17), and/or lymph node biopsy (n = 334; primarily endobronchial ultrasound-guided). Lesions were in the peripheral/middle lung thirds in 92.7%, 49.7% were <20 mm, and 48.4% had a bronchus sign. Radial EBUS was used in 54.3% (543/1,000 subjects) and general anesthesia in 79.7% (797/1,000). Among the 964 subjects (1,129 lesions) undergoing lung lesion biopsy, navigation was completed and tissue was obtained in 94.4% (910/964). Based on final pathology results, ENB-aided samples were read as malignant in 417/910 (45.8%) subjects and non-malignant in 372/910 (40.9%) subjects. An additional 121/910 (13.3%) were read as inconclusive. One-month follow-up in this interim analysis is not sufficient to calculate the true negative rate or diagnostic yield. Tissue adequacy for genetic testing was 80.0% (56 of 70 lesions sent for testing). The ENB-related pneumothorax rate was 4.9% (49/1,000) overall and 3.2% (32/1,000) CTCAE Grade ≥2 (primary endpoint). The ENB-related Grade ≥2 bronchopulmonary hemorrhage and Grade ≥4 respiratory failure rates were 1.0 and 0.6%, respectively. Conclusions: One-month results of the first 1,000 subjects enrolled demonstrate low adverse event rates in a generalizable population across diverse practice settings. Continued enrollment and follow-up are required to calculate the true negative rate and delineate the patient, lesion, and procedural factors contributing to diagnostic yield.

ENB has been evaluated primarily in small, single-center studies; thus, the diagnostic yield in a generalizable setting is unknown. Methods: NAVIGATE is a prospective, multicenter, cohort study that evaluated ENB using the superDimension navigation system (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota). In this United States cohort analysis, 1215 consecutive subjects were enrolled at 29 academic and community sites from April 2015 to August 2016. Results: The median lesion size was 20.0 mm. Fluoroscopy was used in 91% of cases (lesions visible in 60%) and radial endobronchial ultrasound in 57%. The median ENB planning time was 5 minutes; the ENB-speciﬁc procedure time was 25 minutes. Among 1157 subjects undergoing ENBguided biopsy, 94% (1092 of 1157) had navigation completed and tissue obtained. Follow-up was completed in 99% of subjects at 1 month and 80% at 12 months. The 12month diagnostic yield was 73%. Pathology results of the ENB-aided tissue samples showed malignancy in 44% (484 of 1092). Sensitivity, speciﬁcity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for malignancy were 69%, 100%, 100%, and 56%, respectively. ENB-related Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 2 or higher pneumothoraces (requiring admission or chest tube placement) occurred in 2.9%. The ENB-related Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 2 or higher bronchopulmonary hemorrhage and grade 4 or higher respiratory failure rates were 1.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Conclusions: NAVIGATE shows that an ENB-aided diagnosis can be obtained in approximately three-quarters of evaluable patients across a generalizable cohort based on prospective 12-month follow-up in a pragmatic setting with a low procedural complication rate.","2019-03","2025-09-01 18:48:12","2025-09-01 18:48:13","2025-09-01 18:48:12","445-458","","3","14","","Journal of Thoracic Oncology","Electromagnetic Navigation Bronchoscopy for Peripheral Pulmonary Lesions","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/2W3RDQXK/Folch et al. - 2019 - Electromagnetic Navigation Bronchoscopy for Peripheral Pulmonary Lesions One-Year Results of the Pr.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At present, CT-guided percutaneous techniques are used to locate pulmonary nodules, but this method has many limitations. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the accuracy and feasibility of electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy (ENB) with pleural dye to locate small peripheral pulmonary nodules before video-associated thoracic surgery (VATS). Methods The ENB localisation procedure was performed under general anaesthesia in an operating room. Once the locatable guide wire, covered with a sheath, reached the ideal location, it was withdrawn and 0.2–1.0 mL of methylene blue/indocyanine green was injected through the guide sheath. Thereafter, 20–60 mL of air was instilled to disperse the dye to the pleura near the nodules. VATS was then performed immediately. Results Study subjects included 25 patients with 28 nodules. The mean largest diameter of the pulmonary nodules was 11.8 mm (range, 6.0–24.0 mm), and the mean distance from the nearest pleural surface was 13.4 mm (range, 2.5–34.9 mm). After the ENB-guided localisation procedure was completed, the dye was visualised in 23 nodules (82.1%) using VATS. The average duration of the ENB-guided pleural dye marking procedure was 12.6 min (range, 4–30 min). The resection margins were negative in all malignant nodules. Complications unrelated to the ENBguided localisation procedure occurred in two patients, including one case of haemorrhage and one case of slow intraoperative heart rate. Conclusion ENB can be used to safely and accurately locate small peripheral pulmonary nodules and guide surgical resection.

We performed this analysis to determine the usefulness, efﬁcacy, and safety of the ﬂexible cryorecanalization in a large population under routine conditions. Methods: We identiﬁed 225 bronchoscopic interventions that were done as cryorecanalization with a ﬂexible cryoprobe. All patients had symptomatic airway stenosis. We determined the endoscopic success rate and safety (bleeding and perforation) of the procedure. Results: Successful cryorecanalization was achieved in 205 (91.1%) of 225 patients. The ﬂexible cryoprobe was used with all patients, in most patients in combination with ﬂexible bronchoscopy and only in a minority (n = 31, 13.8%) in combination with a rigid bronchoscope. Additional interventional techniques used were endobronchial stents (n ¼ 11, 4.9%) and argon plasma coagulation (n ¼ 37, 16.4%). Mild bleeding (if ice-cold NaCl or epinephrine solution was necessary) occurred in 9 (4.0%) patients, moderate bleeding (if argon plasma coagulation or a bronchus blocker was required) occurred in 18 (8.0%) patients, and severe bleeding (events with hemodynamic instability) never occurred. Conclusions: Cryorecanalization with the ﬂexible cryoprobe for treatment of symptomatic endobronchial tumor stenosis is a safe technique with a high success rate and immediate treatment effect.

To date, the benefits have been modest but have been hypothesized to be much larger in patients without interlobar collateral ventilation than in those with collateral ventilation. METHODS We randomly assigned patients with severe emphysema and a confirmed absence of collateral ventilation to bronchoscopic endobronchial-valve treatment (EBV group) or to continued standard medical care (control group). Primary outcomes were changes from baseline to 6 months in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and 6-minute walk distance. RESULTS Eighty-four patients were recruited, of whom 16 were excluded because they had collateral ventilation (13 patients) or because lobar segments were inaccessible to the endobronchial valves (3 patients). The remaining 68 patients (mean [±SD] age, 59±9 years; 46 were women) were randomly assigned to the EBV group (34 patients) or the control group (34). At baseline, the FEV1 and FVC were 29±7% and 77±18% of the predicted values, respectively, and the 6-minute walk distance was 374±86 m. Intention-to-treat analyses showed significantly greater improvements in the EBV group than in the control group from baseline to 6 months: the increase in FEV1 was greater in the EBV group than in the control group by 140 ml (95% confidence interval [CI], 55 to 225), the increase in FVC was greater by 347 ml (95% CI, 107 to 588), and the increase in the 6-minute walk distance was greater by 74 m (95% CI, 47 to 100) (P<0.01 for all comparisons). By 6 months, 23 serious adverse events had been reported in the EBV group, as compared with 5 in the control group (P<0.001). One patient in the EBV group died.

However, bronchoscopic treatment may provide a complete cure in selected patients. The aim of the study was to review the results of laser treatment of bronchial carcinoids and to compare the outcome after laser resection against the outcome after surgical resection. Methods: Seventy-three patients, 29 men and 44 women, median age 53 years (range, 23 to 78 y), with bronchial carcinoids were treated by surgical resection (n = 48) or endobronchial ablation (n = 25). Bronchoscopic treatment was also performed in 5 of 48 surgical patients as a part of the surgical treatment strategy. Results: Among 25 patients treated endoscopically, 16 were successfully treated with laser, whereas 9 were operated subsequently. One major complication was registered, as an inadvertent ventilation caused a nonfatal ﬁre of the bronchoscope during Nd:YAG laser procedure. Forty-eight patients underwent surgical resection. Most of the patients underwent lobectomy and bilobectomy (30 and 5 patients, respectively). Four of the patients were dead by the end of the study, 1 was treated with laser, and 3 treated with surgical resection. The overall survival was 94.5% in the surgical group and 94.4% in the group treated with endoscopic ablation (P = 0.9). None of the 69 survivors had any sign of recurrence on computed tomographic scans and bronchoscopy by the end of the study. Conclusions: This is a retrospective study and no randomization has been performed. However, the results add evidence to the view that transbronchial laser treatment may be oﬀered as a safe, stand-alone procedure in the treatment of typical carcinoid tumor in the central airways.","2012","2025-09-01 18:48:21","2025-09-01 18:48:21","","","","1","19","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/GVLSKMKU/Neyman et al. - 2012 - Endoscopic Treatment of Bronchial Carcinoids in Comparison to Surgical Resection A Retrospective St.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A prospective randomized study was initiated to test the hypothesis that the addition of EBB to XRT provides higher levels of palliation of dyspnea and other RS and improvement of quality of life (QoL) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with endobronchial tumour. Materials and methods: Patients with previously untreated NSCLC, stages I-IIIb, WHO-performance status of 0±3 and with biopsy proven endobronchial tumour in the proximal airways were eligible. EBB consisted of two fractions of 7.5 Gy at 1 cm on day 1 and 8. XRT started at day 2. The XRT dose was 30 Gy (2 weeks) or 60 Gy (6 weeks). The EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13 were assessed before treatment and 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment. Re-expansion of collapsed lung was tested by the inspiratory vital capacity (IVC) and CT scan of the chest. Results: Ninety-Æve patients were randomized between arm 1 (XRT alone) (n à 48) or arm 2 (XRT 1 EBB) (n à 47). The arms were well balanced regarding pre-treatment characteristics and QoL scores. The compliance for QoL-assessment was .90% at all times. No signiÆcant difference between the trial arms was observed with respect to response of dyspnea. However, a beneÆcial effect of EBB was noted concerning the mean scores of dyspnea over time (P à 0:02), which lasted for 3 months. This beneÆt was only observed among patients with an obstructing tumour of the main bronchus. A higher rate of re-expansion of collapsed lung was observed in arm 2 (57%) compared to arm 1 (35%) (P à 0:01). The inspiratory vital capacity (IVC) assessed 2 weeks after radiotherapy improved with 493 cm3 in arm 2 and decreased 50 cm3 in arm 1 (P à 0:03). No difference was noted regarding the incidence of massive haemoptysis (13 vs. 15%). Conclusion: The addition of EBB to XRT in NSCLC is safe and provides higher rates of re-expansion of collapsed lung resulting in a transient lower levels of dyspnea. This beneÆcial effect was only observed among patients with obstructing tumours in the main bronchus. q 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

We report the safety, accuracy, and practice patterns of FM placement utilizing electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB). Methods: NAVIGATE is a global, prospective, multicenter, observational cohort study of ENB using the superDimension™ navigation system. This prospectively collected subgroup analysis presents the patient demographics, procedural characteristics, and 1-month outcomes in patients undergoing ENB-guided FM placement. Follow up through 24 months is ongoing. Results: Two-hundred fifty-eight patients from 21 centers in the United States were included. General anesthesia was used in 68.2%. Lesion location was confirmed by radial endobronchial ultrasound in 34.5% of procedures. The median ENB procedure time was 31.0 min. Concurrent lung lesion biopsy was conducted in 82.6% (213/258) of patients. A mean of 2.2 ± 1.7 FMs (median 1.0 FMs) were placed per patient and 99.2% were accurately positioned based on subjective operator assessment. Follow-up imaging showed that 94.1% (239/254) of markers remained in place.

This can increase post-operative morbidity, cost, and hospital length of stay. The management of post-pulmonary resection air leaks remains challenging. Minimally invasive effective interventions are necessary. The Spiration Valve System (SVS, Olympus/Spiration Inc., Redmond, WA, US) is approved by the FDA under humanitarian use exemption for management of prolonged air leaks. Methods This is a prospective multicenter registry of 39 patients with air leaks after lobectomy, segmentectomy, and LVRS managed with an intention to use bronchoscopic SVS to resolve air leaks. Results Bronchoscopic SVS placement was feasible in 82.1% of patients (32/39 patients) and 90 valves were placed with a median of 2 valves per patient (mean of 2.7±1.5 valves, range of 1 to 7 valves). Positive response to SVS placement was documented in 76.9% of all patients (30/39 patients) and in 93.8% of patients when SVS placement was feasible (30/32 patients). Air leaks ultimately resolved when SVS placement was feasible in 87.5% of patients (28/32 patients), after a median of 2.5 days (mean±SD of 8.9±12.4 days). Considering all patients with an intention to treat analysis, bronchoscopic SVS procedure likely contributed to resolution of air leaks in 71.8% of patients (28/39 patients). The post-procedure median hospital stay was 4 days (mean 6.0 ±6.1 days). Conclusions This prospective registry adds to the growing body of literature supporting feasible and effective management of air leaks utilizing one-way valves.","2019-10","2025-09-01 18:48:45","2025-09-01 18:48:45","2025-09-01 18:48:45","627-633","","5","197","","Lung","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/FKT2L9A9/Abu-Hijleh et al. - 2019 - Intrabronchial Valves for Air Leaks After Lobectomy, Segmentectomy, and Lung Volume Reduction Surger.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of airway stent insertion on MTEF patients. Methods: A total of 63 MTEF patients were included, 12 patients with lung cancer and 46 patients with esophageal cancers. Eight zones were proposed to classify various ﬁstula locations. Airway stents were selected based on the various zones and ﬁstula size. Results: Airway stents were successfully inserted in all patients, and both airway and esophageal stents in 8 patients. Most ﬁstula were located in locations II (18/63, 28.6%), III (22/63, 34.9%), then VII (9/63, 14.3%). The stents included 10 (15.9%) I shaped, 8 (12.7%) L shaped and 45 (71.4%) Y shaped.

This study describes the clinical effects of airway ultraﬂex stenting as an alternative method for ERF caused by esophageal cancer. Methods: In an university-afﬁliated hospital, consecutive patients with ERF caused by esophageal cancer and conﬁrmed by bronchoscopy were included. The demography, clinical manifestations and survival between groups with and without airway stenting were compared by case-control study. Results: From 2001 to 2007, 817 patients with esophageal cancer received bronchoscopy. Among these patients, 59 patients with ERF were included in this study. The demography and clinical manifestations between groups with and without airway stenting were similar, but survival improved in group with airway stenting, which was compared using log-rank test [P 5 0.04; hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% conﬁdence interval (CI), 0.31–0.99].

We described the endoscopic management of benign ERF. The aim of the study was to describe outcomes of endoscopic treatment of nonmalignant ERF and to analyze factors associated with its success. Methods This is a retrospective study involving patients managed for benign ERF in our center between 2012 and 2016. The ERFs were classified into three groups of sizes: (I) punctiform, (II) medium, and (III) large. The primary aim was to document the endoscopic success (= fistula’s healing after 6 months). The secondary objectives were characteristics of endoscopic treatment, the functional success and death, and identifying factors associated with success and death. Results 22 patients were included. The etiologies of ERF were surgery in 12 patients, esophageal dilatation in 3, invasive ventilation in 3, radiation therapy in 2, and tracheostomy in 2. Ninety-three procedures were performed (mean of number: 4.2 ± 4.5/patient). Twenty-one patients had stent placement, eight over-the-scope clips (OTSC), and seven a combined therapy. The endoscopic success rate was 45.5% (n = 10; 67% in punctiform, 50% in medium, and 14% in large ERF), and the functional success was 55% (n = 12). Serious adverse events occurred in 9 patients (40.9%). Six patients died (27%). The persistence of the orifice after 6 months of endoscopic treatment was associated with failure (OR 44; IC95: 3.38–573.4; p = 0.004 multivariate analysis). The orifice’s size was associated with mortality [71% of death if large fistulas (p = 0.001) univariate analysis]. Conclusion Endoscopic treatment of ERF leads to 45.5% of successful endoscopic closure and 55.5% of functional success, depending on fistula’s orifice size. After 6 months without healing, the chances for success dramatically decrease.","2019-02","2025-09-01 18:48:51","2025-09-01 18:48:52","2025-09-01 18:48:51","549-556","","2","33","","Surg Endosc","Endoscopic treatment of nonmalignant tracheoesophageal and bronchoesophageal fistula","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/JCPAPRYG/Debourdeau et al. - 2019 - Endoscopic treatment of nonmalignant tracheoesophageal and bronchoesophageal fistula results and pr.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: It was a retrospective multicenter study including consecutive patients with PALs for alveolar pleural fistula (APF) undergoing valve treatment. We assessed the efficacy and the cost of the procedure. Results: Seventy-four patients with persistent air leaks due to various etiologies were included in the analysis. In all cases the air leaks were severe and refractory to standard treatments. Sixty-seven (91%) patients underwent valve treatment obtaining a complete resolution of air-leaks in 59 (88%) patients; a reduction of air-leaks in 6 (9%); and no benefits in 2 (3%). The comparison of data before and after valve treatment showed a significant reduction of air-leak duration (16.2±8.8 versus 5.0±1.7 days; P<0.0001); chest tube removal (16.2±8.8 versus 7.3±2.7 days; P<0.0001); and length of hospital stay (LOS) (16.2±8.8 versus 9.7±2.8 days; P=0.004). Seven patients not undergoing valve treatment underwent pneumo-peritoneum with pleurodesis (n=6) or only pleurodesis (n=1). In only 1 (14%) patient, the chest drainage was removed 23 days later while the remaining 6 (86%) were discharged with a domiciliary chest drainage removed after 157±41 days. No significant difference was found in health cost before and after endobronchial valve (EBV) implant (P=0.3). Conclusions: Valve treatment for persistent air leaks is an effective procedure. The reduction of hospitalization costs related to early resolution of air-leaks could overcome the procedural cost.","2018-11","2025-09-01 18:48:55","2025-09-01 18:48:55","2025-09-01 18:48:55","6158-6167","","11","10","","J.

This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of customized airway stenting in the treatment of bronchopleural fistula. Methods A series of airway stents for dedicated bronchopleural fistula occlusion were designed after taking into account the anatomical and pathophysiological features of post-pulmonary resection fistulas and the shortcomings of airway stents currently available. The fistulas were occluded with the bullet head or a special part of the covered airway stent. Successful stenting was defined as immediate cessation of air leak from the residual cavity after stenting. The results were retrospectively analyzed. Results Airway occlusion stenting was successful on the first attempt in 143/148 (96.6%) patients with bronchopleural fistulas. In the remaining 5 patients, occlusion was successful only on the second try. At follow-up 30 days after stenting, 141 patients reported relief in symptoms.

Its management can be complex and challenging. Although conservative treatment with chest drain and observation is usually effective, other invasive techniques are needed when conservative treatment fails. Surgical management and medical pleurodesis have long been the usual treatments for PAL. More recently numerous bronchoscopic procedures have been introduced to treat PAL in those patients who are poor candidates for surgery or who decline surgery. These techniques include bronchoscopic use of sealants, sclerosants, and various types of implanted devices. Recently, removable one-way valves have been developed that are able to be placed bronchoscopically in the affected airways, ameliorating air-leaks in patients who are not candidates for surgery. Future comparative trials are needed to refine our understanding of the indications, effectiveness, and complications of bronchoscopic techniques for treating PAL.

Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to determine the association between neoadjuvant therapy and risk of bronchopleural fistula in patients undergoing lung cancer surgery. Methods: We searched PubMed and EMBASE to identify the full-text literatures that met our eligibility criteria. Odds ratio with 95% confidence interval served as the summarized statistics. Heterogeneity within this meta-analysis was evaluated by Q-test and I2 statistic. Sensitivity analysis was performed for further assessments of robustness. Publication bias was detected by Begg’s test and Egger’s test. Results: Thirty studies enrolling 14 912 lung cancer cases were included into this meta-analysis. The incidence of bronchopleural fistula was 2.4% (354/14 912) in the large scale. Overall, neoadjuvant therapy significantly increased the risk of bronchopleural fistula after pulmonary resections (odds ratio: 2.166; 95% confidence interval: 1.398–3.357; P = 0.001). In subgroup analysis, neoadjuvant radiotherapy (odds ratio: 3.914; 95% confidence interval: 1.401–10.935; P = 0.009) and chemo-radiation (odds ratio: 2.533; 95% confidence interval: 1.353–4.741; P = 0.004) were significantly associated with the bronchopleural fistula risk but neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not (odds ratio: 1.857; 95% confidence interval: 0.881–3.911; P = 0.104). The impact of neoadjuvant therapy on bronchopleural fistula occurrence remains statistically prominent in the other subgroups. Conclusions: Neoadjuvant therapy is significantly associated with the occurrence of bronchopleural fistula after lung cancer surgery. Both neoadjuvant radiotherapy and chemo-radiation significantly increase the bronchopleural fistula risk but neoadjuvant chemotherapy does not. Some limitations still exist in this meta-analysis.

Methods Reports on early bronchopleural fistula after anatomical lung resection in adults, including information on risk factors, published between 2006 and 2016 were reviewed and our institutional data were evaluated. The early period was defined as within 30 days from surgery or as described early in the manuscript. Results A total of seven retrospective observational articles were selected. Four articles investigated lobectomy and pneumonectomy, while the other three articles investigated only pneumonectomy. The surgical procedure, preoperative therapy, complications after surgery, right side, patient age, past history, and tumor residuals were mentioned as risk factors of bronchopleural fistula. Our data concluded that neoadjuvant therapy and a right lower lobe location were risk factors after a lobectomy, while a right side and complete pneumonectomy were risk factors after a pneumonectomy. Conclusions Although recent studies have reached nearly the same conclusions as older reports, continuous research of potential risk factor is needed as therapeutic procedures continue to evolve.","2017-12","2025-09-01 18:49:11","2025-09-01 18:49:11","2025-09-01 18:49:11","679-685","","12","65","","Gen Thorac Cardiovasc Surg","Risk factor of bronchopleural fistula after general thoracic surgery","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/VJ6IJDZ5/Okuda et al. - 2017 - Risk factor of bronchopleural fistula after general thoracic surgery review article.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our data showed high technical success rates (97.1% of procedures) and with good, but not ideal, clinical success rates (60% of procedures, 80% of patients), which were deﬁned as ﬁstula closure conﬁrmed by radiographic or repeat endoscopic evaluation and/or a lack of recurrent episodes of clinical aspiration to focus on durable ERF closure as opposed to only initial success. Proximal ERF were the most difﬁcult to manage with the lowest overall clinical success rates, highest rates of recurrent aspiration despite endoscopic therapy, highest adverse events, and shortest survival times.

Patients may present with acute onset cough, chest pain, breathlessness or sub-acutely with unexplained hemoptysis, non-resolving pneumonia and at times, as an incidental finding on imaging. Patients with iatrogenic FB such as an aspirated broken tooth during difficult intubation or a broken instrument are more common scenarios in the intensive care unit (ICU). Patients with post-obstructive pneumonia with or without sepsis, or variable degree of hemoptysis often require ICU level of care and bronchoscopic interventions. Rigid bronchoscopy has traditionally been the modality of choice; however, with the innovation in instrumentation and wider availability of flexible bronchoscopes, most of the FB removal is now successfully performed using flexible bronchoscopy. Proceduralists choose instruments in accordance with their training and expertise. We describe the use of most common instruments including forceps, balloon catheters, and baskets. Role of cryoprobe and LASER in FB removal is reviewed as well. In general, larger working channel bronchoscopes are preferred; however, smaller working channel bronchoscopes may be used in situations when the patients are intubated with a smaller diameter endotracheal or tracheostomy tubes. Large size FB are removed en bloc with the grasping tool, bronchoscope, and endotracheal or tracheostomy tube, requiring preparation to safely re-establish the airway. After FB removal, bronchoscopy is re-performed to identify any residual FB, assess any injury to the airway, suction post-obstructive secretions or pus, control any active bleeding and remove granulation tissue that may be obstructing the airway. Additional interventions like balloon dilatation may be required to dislodge an impacted FB or to maintain patency of bronchial lumen. If bronchoscopic methods fail, surgery may be required for retrieval of FB in symptomatic patients or to resect suppurative or necrotizing lung process. Multidisciplinary approach involving intensivists, surgeons, and anesthesiologists is the key to optimal patient outcomes.","2021-08","2025-09-01 18:49:21","2025-09-01 18:49:21","2025-09-01 18:49:21","5159-5175","","8","13","","J Thorac Dis","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/KRXRX9PZ/Bajaj et al. - 2021 - Foreign body aspiration.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, metered cryospray (MCS) delivering liquid nitrogen to the tracheobronchial airways ablates abnormal epithelium and facilitates healthy mucosal regeneration. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and safety of MCS in chronic bronchitis. Methods: Patients with a forced expiratory volume in 1 s of 30–80% predicted who were taking optimal medication were recruited. Primary outcomes were feasibility (completion of treatments), efficacy (3-month change in St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)) and safety (incidence of adverse events). Secondary outcomes were lung function, exercise capacity and additional patient-reported outcomes. Results: 35 patients, 19 male/16 female, aged 47–76 years, Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease grade I (n=3), II (n=10) and III (n=22), underwent staggered liquid nitrogen treatments to the tracheobronchial tree. 34 patients completed three treatments, each lasting 34.3±12.1 min, separated by 4–6 weeks; one withdrew after the first treatment. ∼1800 doses of MCS were delivered. Clinically meaningful improvements in patient-reported outcomes were observed at 3 months: change in SGRQ −6.4 (95% CI −11.4 to −1.3; p=0.01), COPD Assessment Test (CAT) −3.8 (95% CI −6.4 to −1.3; p<0.01) and Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) 21.6 (95% CI 7.3 to 35.9; p<0.01). Changes in CAT were durable to 6 months (−3.4, 95% CI −5.9 to −0.9; p=0.01); changes in SGRQ and LCQ were durable to 9 months (−6.9, 95% CI −13.0 to −0.9; p=0.03 and 13.4, 95% CI 2.1 to 24.6; p=0.02, respectively. At 12 months, 14 serious adverse events were recorded in 11 (31.4%) subjects; six (43%) moderate and eight (57%) severe. Nine were respiratory-related: six exacerbations of COPD, two pneumonias and one case of increased coughing; all recovered without sequelae. None were serious device- or procedure-related adverse events.

However, there is no consensus on the optimal timing of tracheostomy in ICU patients. Ultrasound (US) and bronchoscopy are useful adjunct tools to optimize procedural performance. US can be used pre-procedurally to identify vascular structures and to select the optimal puncture site, intra-procedurally to assist with accurate placement of the introducer needle, and post-procedurally to evaluate for a pneumothorax. Bronchoscopy provides real-time visual guidance from within the tracheal lumen and can reduce complications, such as paratracheal puncture and injury to the posterior tracheal wall. A step-by-step detailed procedural guide, including preparation and procedural technique, is provided with a team-based approach. Technical aspects, such as recommended equipment and selection of appropriate tracheostomy tube type and size, are discussed. Certain procedural considerations to minimize the risk of complications should be given in circumstances of patient obesity, coagulopathy, or neurologic illness.

No studies have compared the incidence rates of infection in patients with stents with those without stents. We hypothesized that patients with stents would have a higher incidence of lower respiratory tract infections than would patients without stents. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study, covering the period September 2009 to August 2011, of patients who had therapeutic bronchoscopy for malignant airways disease. Outcomes recorded were lower respiratory tract infection and airway restenosis by tumor. Results: Seventy-two patients had therapeutic bronchoscopy for malignant airways disease. Twentyfour of these patients had one or more stents placed. Twenty-three of the 72 patients (32%) developed lower respiratory tract infections. Stents were associated with an increased risk of infection (hazard ratio [HR], 3.76; 95% CI, 1.57-8.99; P 5 .003). The incidence rate of lower respiratory tract infection was 0.0057 infections per person-day in patients with stents vs 0.0011 infections per person-day in patients without stents. The incidence rate difference, 0.0046 infections per person-day, was signiﬁcant (95% CI, 0.0012-0.0081; P 5 .0002). Restenosis due to tumor overgrowth was associated with more severe obstruction at baseline (obstruction 50% vs , 50% preprocedure; HR, 13.71; 95% CI, 1.75-107.55; P 5 .013). Conclusion: Therapeutic bronchoscopy with stent placement is associated with a higher risk of infection than is therapeutic bronchoscopy alone.

By assessing risk factors associated with a MSSP recurrence, there is potential to identify patients who could benefit from early intervention intended to prevent recurrence. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with MSSP. The primary outcome was time to MSSP recurrence. We used a competing risk model to identify risk factors associated with MSSP recurrence. Results: A total of 2,532 patients were diagnosed with pneumothorax, with 114 having MSSP but only 96 were evaluable for the time-to-recurrence analysis. Of the 96 patients, 9 (9.4%) patients experienced recurrent MSSP, and 58 (60.4%) patients died during the study’s follow-up period. The estimated cumulative incidence (CI) of MSSP considering death as a competing risk was 10.1% at 15 months. The univariable model identified the following covariates as associated with MSSP recurrence: mediastinal shift (HR 12.30, 95% CI: 3.44–43.91, P<0.001), distance from lung apex to thoracic cupola (HR 1.02, 95% CI: 1.00–1.03, P=0.003), and distance between visceral and chest wall at the hilum (HR 1.02, 95% CI: 1.00–1.03, P=0.026). Conclusions: Although the incidence of MSSP recurrence was found to be low, clinical factors such as sarcoma, the associated mediastinal shift, greater distance from lung apex to thoracic cupola, greater distance between visceral and chest wall at the hilum were found to be risk factors for MSSP recurrence.","2019-04","2025-09-01 18:49:36","2025-09-01 18:49:36","2025-09-01 18:49:36","1495-1505","","4","11","","J.

These therapies are in an early phase of clinical research and larger randomised controlled trials are needed to confirm the pilot data available and to evaluate the treatment durability. The fourth technique, targeted lung denervation (TLD), aims to decrease the release of acetylcholine, which regulates smooth muscle tone and mucus production by ablating the parasympathetic nerves running alongside the main bronchi.

Methods and Materials: We reviewed the treatment outcomes between 1988 and 1997 in 175 lung cancer patients who underwent HDR EBBT for recurrent or metastatic tumors at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. One hundred sixty of these patients had previously received thoracic external-beam irradiation. This updated report includes 74 patients from a previous series. Most patients received 3,000-cGy EBBT delivered at a distance of 6 mm and divided into 2 fractions over 2 weeks. Subjective response was assessed by questionnaire at follow-up. Objective response was assessed by physical examination, bronchoscopy, and chest radiograph. Results: The median actuarial survival for the entire group was 6 months from the time of the ﬁrst EBBT treatment session. Of the 115 patients (66%) who showed symptomatic improvement, 32% were much improved and 34% were slightly improved. Patients showing improvement survived for signiﬁcantly longer than those who showed no change or worsening symptoms (7 vs. 4 months, p 5 0.0032). Repeat bronchoscopy demonstrated a 78% overall objective response rate that correlated signiﬁcantly with subjective response and symptom relief. Complications occurred in 19 patients (11% crude rate) with an actuarial complication rate of 13% at 1 year from the time of the ﬁrst EBBT treatment session. The actuarial hazard for fatal hemoptysis due to EBBT was 5%. Conclusion: HDR EBBT effectively palliates most patients’ symptoms caused by endobronchial lesions. This relief correlates signiﬁcantly with an overall survival beneﬁt.

Indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) are tunneled catheters that allow ambulatory intermittent drainage of pleural ﬂuid without repeated thoracentesis. Despite the efﬁcacy and safety of IPCs, data supporting postplacement follow-up is limited and variable. Our study aims to characterize the impact of a dedicated pleural clinic (PC) on patient outcomes as they relate to IPCs. Methods: Patients who underwent IPC placement between 2015 and 2021 were included in this retrospective study. Differences in outcomes were analyzed between patients with an IPC placed and managed by Interventional Pulmonology (IP) through the PC and those placed by non-IP services (non-PC providers) before and after the PC implementation. Results: In total, 371 patients received IPCs. Since the implementation of the PC, there was an increase in ambulatory IPC placement (31/133 pre-PC vs. 96/238 post-PC; P = 0.001). There were fewer admissions before IPC placement (18/103 vs. 43/133; P = 0.01), and fewer thoracenteses per patient (2.7 ± 2.5 in PC cohort vs. 4 ± 5.1 in non-PC cohort; P < 0.01). The frequency of pleurodesis was higher in the PC cohort (40/103 vs. 41/268; P < 0.001). A Fine and Gray competing risks model indicated higher likelihood of pleurodesis in the PC cohort (adjusted subhazard ratio 3.8, 95% CI: 2.5-5.87).

One explanation for this is divergence between the nodule location on the preprocedure CT scan and its actual location during the procedure. Fluoroscopic ENB (F-ENB) consists of digital tomosynthesis using a conventional C-arm to re-register the target lesion based on near real-time imaging. We performed a retrospective review of ENB cases at our institution before and after introduction of F-ENB to assess diagnostic yield. Methods: All consecutive ENB procedures performed at our institution from 25 December 2017 to 25 August 2018 were reviewed. F-ENB was introduced on 25 April 2018. Two cohorts were analysed: standard ENB (S-ENB) from 25 December 2017 to 24 April 2018 and F-ENB from 25 April 2018 to 25 August 2018. All procedural, demographic and diagnostic data were collected. Descriptive statistics, chi-square, Wilcoxon test and Student’s t-test were used where appropriate. A multivariable regression analysis was performed to assess factors associated with diagnostic yield. Results: A total of 101 and 67 nodules were biopsied in the S-ENB and F-ENB groups, respectively. Diagnostic yield was 54% in S-ENB cohort and 79% in the F-ENB group (P = 0.0019). Factors independently associated with a positive diagnosis were F-ENB and a positive radial ultrasound view (odds ratio (OR): 3.57, 95% CI: 1.56–8.18 and OR: 3.74, 95% CI: 1.37–11.05, respectively).

Additionally, when there is concern for malignancy, guidelines have recommended performing the least invasive evaluation. Conventional bronchoscopy diagnostic yields for PPLs have reportedly been quite low and prior electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) studies have reported variable yields. Navigation bronchoscopy in addition to endobronchial ultrasound allows a physician to evaluate peripheral lung lesions along with mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes for the diagnosis and staging of suspected malignancy in one procedure. More recent advances in navigational bronchoscopy including the use of augmented fluoroscopy (AF), cone beam CT, and robotic bronchoscopy have pushed the boundaries of capability in evaluating PPLs. These added bronchoscopic technologies have shown to improve diagnostic yield especially when modalities are used in combination. The ultimate goal of endoscopically localized ablative and therapeutic treatment for peripheral lung lesions will require a high level of physician confidence, accuracy, and precision.

While BLVR is often effective for improving dyspnea by causing target lobe atelectasis, the treatment effect can sometimes be lost. This study reviews the incidence of revision bronchoscopies in patients who lost or never achieved target lobe atelectasis following BLVR. Methods: This retrospective, single-center analysis reviewed patients who underwent BLVR over a 5-year period. All patients were determined to be collateral ventilation negative by an intraprocedural Chartis system assessment. Treatment success was deﬁned as radiographic target lobe atelectasis. For patients who underwent revision bronchoscopies, the EMR was used to review procedure notes, radiographic imaging, post-BLVR analyses, and outpatient clinic notes to collect data on the indication for revision bronchoscopy, intraprocedural observations accounting for loss of treatment effect, revision interventions performed, and outcomes of revision bronchoscopies. After a minimum of 10 postoperative days, at the discretion of the treating physician, an EBV revision bronchoscopy could be performed if target lobe atelectasis was lost or never developed after initial treatment. Results: Forty-three total valve revision procedures were performed, based on ﬁrst, second, and third bronchoscopies combined. The most common cause for revision bronchoscopy based on the intraoperative assessment was air leaking around one or more valves from either incorrect sizing of previous valves or airway stretching in 18 revision procedures (42%). Thirty-four revision procedures (79%) were performed for loss of previous atelectasis, and 24 (70%) resulted in the redevelopment of target lobe atelectasis. Nine revision procedures (21%) were performed for lack of initial target lobe atelectasis. Two of the 9 revision procedures (22%) performed for failure to achieve initial atelectasis resulted in new target lobe atelectasis. Conclusion: Post-BLVR revision bronchoscopies are necessary in ∼20% of patients for either loss of target lobe atelectasis or failure to achieve atelectasis after the initial BLVR procedure. In many cases, especially when atelectasis is lost, revision bronchoscopies can reestablish post-BLVR atelectasis.","2025-01","2025-09-01 18:50:05","2025-09-01 18:50:05","2025-09-01 18:50:05","","","1","32","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/9B2FM63K/Mahajan et al. - 2025 - Incidence and Outcomes of Revision Bronchoscopies Following Bronchoscopic Lung Volume Reduction (BLV.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most cases are autoimmune and are associated with an autoantibody against granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) that prevents clearing of pulmonary surfactant by alveolar macrophages. An open-label, phase 2 study showed some therapeutic efficacy of inhaled recombinant human GM-CSF in patients with severe pulmonary alveolar proteinosis; however, the efficacy in patients with mild-to-moderate disease remains unclear. METHODS We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of daily inhaled recombinant human GM-CSF (sargramostim), at a dose of 125 μg twice daily for 7 days, every other week for 24 weeks, or placebo in 64 patients with autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis who had a partial pressure of arterial oxygen (Pao2) while breathing ambient air of less than 70 mm Hg (or <75 mm Hg in symptomatic patients). Patients with severe pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (Pao2 <50 mm Hg) were excluded to avoid possible exacerbation of the disease in patients who were assigned to receive placebo. The primary end point was the change in the alveolar–arterial oxygen gradient between baseline and week 25. RESULTS The change in the mean (±SD) alveolar–arterial oxygen gradient was significantly better in the GM-CSF group (33 patients) than in the placebo group (30 patients) (mean change from baseline, −4.50±9.03 mm Hg vs. 0.17±10.50 mm Hg; P = 0.02). The change between baseline and week 25 in the density of the lung field on computed tomography was also better in the GM-CSF group (between-group difference, −36.08 Hounsfield units; 95% confidence interval, −61.58 to −6.99, calculated with the use of the Mann–Whitney U test and the Hodges–Lehmann estimate of confidence intervals for pseudo-medians). Serious adverse events developed in 6 patients in the GM-CSF group and in 3 patients in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS In this randomized, controlled trial, inhaled recombinant human GM-CSF was associated with a modest salutary effect on the laboratory outcome of arterial oxygen tension, and no clinical benefits were noted.

To date, there have been no prospective studies of the effectiveness of inhaled TA for the treatment of hemoptysis. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to prospectively assess the effectiveness of TA inhalations (ie, nebulized TA) for hemoptysis treatment. METHODS: This analysis was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of treatment with nebulized TA (500 mg tid) vs placebo (normal saline) in patients admitted with hemoptysis of various etiologies. Patients with massive hemoptysis (expectorated blood > 200 mL/24 h) and hemodynamic or respiratory instability were excluded. Mortality and hemoptysis recurrence rate were assessed at 30 days and following 1 year. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were randomized to receive TA inhalations (n ¼ 25) or normal saline (n ¼ 22). TA was associated with a signiﬁcantly reduced expectorated blood volume starting from day 2 of admission. Resolution of hemoptysis within 5 days of admission was observed in more TA-treated patients than in those receiving placebo (96% vs 50%; P < .0005). Mean hospital length of stay was shorter for the TA group (5.7 2.5 days vs 7.8 4.6 days; P ¼ .046), with fewer patients requiring invasive procedures such as interventional bronchoscopy or angiographic embolization to control the bleeding (0% vs 18.2%; P ¼ .041). No side effects were noted in either group throughout the follow-up period. In addition, a reduced recurrence rate was noted at the 1-year follow-up (P ¼ .009).

Drainage of infected fluid is key to successful treatment, but intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy did not improve outcomes in an earlier, large, randomized trial. Methods We conducted a blinded, 2-by-2 factorial trial in which 210 patients with pleural infection were randomly assigned to receive one of four study treatments for 3 days: double placebo, intrapleural tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and DNase, t-PA and placebo, or DNase and placebo. The primary outcome was the change in pleural opacity, measured as the percentage of the hemithorax occupied by effusion, on chest radiography on day 7 as compared with day 1. Secondary outcomes included referral for surgery, duration of hospital stay, and adverse events. Results The mean (±SD) change in pleural opacity was greater in the t-PA–DNase group than in the placebo group (−29.5±23.3% vs. −17.2±19.6%; difference, −7.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], −13.4 to −2.4; P = 0.005); the change observed with t-PA alone and with DNase alone (−17.2±24.3 and −14.7±16.4%, respectively) was not significantly different from that observed with placebo. The frequency of surgical referral at 3 months was lower in the t-PA–DNase group than in the placebo group (2 of 48 patients [4%] vs. 8 of 51 patients [16%]; odds ratio for surgical referral, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.87; P = 0.03) but was greater in the DNase group (18 of 46 patients [39%]) than in the placebo group (odds ratio, 3.56; 95% CI, 1.30 to 9.75; P=0.01). Combined t-PA–DNase therapy was associated with a reduction in the hospital stay, as compared with placebo (difference, −6.7 days; 95% CI, −12.0 to −1.9; P=0.006); the hospital stay with either agent alone was not significantly different from that with placebo. The frequency of adverse events did not differ significantly among the groups. Conclusions Intrapleural t-PA–DNase therapy improved fluid drainage in patients with pleural infection and reduced the frequency of surgical referral and the duration of the hospital stay. Treatment with DNase alone or t-PA alone was ineffective.

It remains unclear which therapeutic bronchoscopic modality [laser, stenting, external beam radiation, brachytherapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT)] used for restoring airway patency positively affects outcomes in these patients. We analyzed the effectiveness of PDT in terms of mortality, and time to subsequent treatments in patients with stage III and IV NSCLC. Methods: Study used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Medicare linked data. We categorized NSCLC patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2011 and with stage III and IV, into three treatment groups: PDT + radiation ± chemotherapy, non-PDT ablation therapy + radiation ± chemotherapy, and radiation + chemotherapy. We analyzed all-cause and cause-specific mortality using Cox proportional hazard models with an inverse probability weighted propensity score adjustment. Time to subsequent treatment was analyzed using GLM model. Results: For the PDT group, hazard for all-cause and cause-specific mortality was comparable to the radiation + chemotherapy group (HR =1.03, 95% CI: 0.73–1.45; and HR =1.04, 95% CI: 0.71–1.51, respectively). The non-PDT ablation group had higher hazard for all-cause (HR =1.22, 95% CI: 1.13–1.33) and cause-specific mortality (HR =1.10, 95% CI: 1.01–1.20), compared to the radiation + chemotherapy group. The PDT group had longer time to follow-up treatment, compared to non-PDT ablation group. Conclusions: In our exploratory study of stage III and IV NSCLC patients with CAO, addition of PDT demonstrated hazard of mortality comparable to radiation + chemotherapy group. However, addition of non-PDT ablation showed higher mortality compared to the radiation + chemotherapy group. Future studies should investigate the efficacy and effectiveness of multimodal therapy including radiation, chemo, immunotherapy and bronchoscopic interventions.","2019-10","2025-09-01 18:50:27","2025-09-01 18:50:28","2025-09-01 18:50:27","4389-4399","","10","11","","J.

Precise staging is imperative for the development of successful treatment approaches and improvement of patient outcomes. Traditionally, lung cancer staging has depended on the TNM staging system, and the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) has recently recommended modifications. The updated classification for the ninth edition of the TNM staging system (TNM-9), slated to take effect in January 2025, is derived from a thorough analysis of a newly established large international database of lung cancer cases compiled by the IASLC. Proposed changes in TNM-9 include the following: (a) The mediastinal nodal category (N2) was split into single-station (N2a) and multiple-station (N2b) subcategories, and (b) multiple extrathoracic metastatic lesions (M1c) were split into single organ system (M1c1) and multiple organ systems (M1c2) subcategories. Considering these revisions, adjustments have been made to the established stage groups. In terms of pathologic nodal staging, patients in the post-neoadjuvant ypN category demonstrated worse prognosis than those in the similar non-neoadjuvant pN category. Understanding the fundamental changes introduced in TNM-9 enables radiologists to precisely determine the clinical stage of lung cancer and enhance therapeutic approaches.             © RSNA, 2024","2024-12-01","2025-09-01 18:50:38","2025-09-01 18:50:38","2025-09-01 18:50:38","e240057","","12","44","","RadioGraphics","Proposed Ninth Edition TNM Staging System for Lung Cancer","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/NE64G4T3/Klug et al. - 2024 - Proposed Ninth Edition TNM Staging System for Lung Cancer Guide for Radiologists.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditionally it is performed in three separate treatment sessions, targeting different portions of the lung, and each requires an anaesthetic and hospital admission. Compression of treatment into 2 sessions would present a more convenient alternative for patients. In this prospective observational study, the safety of compressing BT into two treatment sessions was compared with the traditional 3 treatment approach. Methods: Sixteen patients meeting ERS/ATS criteria for severe asthma consented to participate in an accelerated treatment schedule (ABT), which treated the whole left lung followed by the right lung four weeks later. The shortterm outcomes of these patients were compared with 37 patients treated with conventional BT scheduling (CBT). The outcome measures used to assess safety were (1) the requirement to remain in hospital beyond the electively planned 24-h admission and (2) the need for re-admission for any cause within of 30 days of treatment. Results: The total number of radiofrequency activations delivered in the ABT group was similar to CBT (187 ± 21 vs 176 ± 40, p = 0.326). With ABT, 11 in 31 admissions (37.9%) required prolonged admission due to wheezing, compared to 5.4% with CBT (p = 0.0025). The mean hospital length of stay with ABT was 1.8 ± 1.3 days, compared to 1.1 ± 0.4 days (p < 0.001). ICU monitoring was required on 5 occasions with ABT (16.1%), compared to 0.9% with CBT (p = 0.002). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that females were more likely to require prolonged admission (OR 11.6, p = 0.0025). The 30-day hospital readmission rate was similar for both groups (6.4% vs 5.4%, p = 0.67). All patients made a complete recovery after treatment with similar outcomes at the 6-month follow-up reassessment. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that ABT results in greater short-term deterioration in lung function associated with a greater risk of prolonged hospital and ICU stay, predominantly affecting females. Therefore, in females, these risks need to be balanced against the convenience of fewer treatment sessions. In males, it may be an advantage to compress treatment.","2021-12","2025-09-01 18:50:41","2025-09-01 18:50:41","2025-09-01 18:50:41","307","","1","22","","Respir Res","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/R5KP6D49/Koshy et al. - 2021 - Safety of delivering bronchial thermoplasty in two treatment sessions.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objectives: To assess the efficacy and safety of Zephyr valves in such a population. Methods: Studies were identified from MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. All searches were current until June 2018. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy and safety of Zephyr. We defined as outcome: change in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), in the 6-min walking test (6MWT), in the St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), and in residual volume (RV). Safety analysis included relative risk (RR) of pneumothorax. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. Results: 7 RCTs reported on Zephyr valves and 5 RCTs included only patients without CV. Zephyr improved FEV1 with a mean difference (MD) of 17.36% (CI, 9.28–25.45, I2 = 78%).

The goal of this consensus statement is to examine the current evidence for performing tracheostomy in patients with respiratory failure from COVID-19 and offer guidance to physicians on the preparation, timing, and technique while minimizing the risk of infection to health care workers (HCWs). METHODS: A panel including intensivists and interventional pulmonologists from three professional societies representing 13 institutions with experience in managing patients with COVID-19 across a spectrum of health-care environments developed key clinical questions addressing speciﬁc topics on tracheostomy in COVID-19. A systematic review of the literature and an established modiﬁed Delphi consensus methodology were applied to provide a reliable evidence-based consensus statement and expert panel report. RESULTS: Eight key questions, corresponding to 14 decision points, were rated by the panel. The results were aggregated, resulting in eight main recommendations and ﬁve additional remarks intended to guide health-care providers in the decision-making process pertinent to tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19-related respiratory failure. CONCLUSION: This panel suggests performing tracheostomy in patients expected to require prolonged mechanical ventilation. A speciﬁc timing of tracheostomy cannot be recommended. There is no evidence for routine repeat reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing in patients with conﬁrmed COVID-19 evaluated for tracheostomy. To reduce the risk of infection in HCWs, we recommend performing the procedure using techniques that minimize aerosolization while wearing enhanced personal protective equipment. The recommendations presented in this statement may change as more experience is gained during this pandemic.","2020-10","2025-09-01 18:50:44","2025-09-01 18:50:44","2025-09-01 18:50:44","1499-1514","","4","158","","Chest","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/93783PW9/Lamb et al. - 2020 - Use of Tracheostomy During the COVID-19 Pandemic.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

During the procedure, a feeding tube that delivers either a liquid diet, or medication, via a clean or sterile delivery system, is placed surgically through the anterior abdominal wall. Those undergoing PEG tube placement are often vulnerable to infection because of age, compromised nutritional intake, immunosuppression, or underlying disease processes such as malignancy and diabetes mellitus. The increasing incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) contributes both an additional risk to the placement procedure, and to the debate surrounding antibiotic prophylaxis for PEG tube placement. The aim of surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis is to establish a bactericidal concentration of an antimicrobial drug in the patient's serum and tissues, via a brief course of an appropriate agent, by the time of PEG tube placement in order to prevent any peristomal infections that might result from the procedure.","2013-11-14","2025-09-01 18:50:49","2025-09-01 18:50:50","2025-09-01 18:50:49","","","11","2013","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/CM8XF77H/Lipp and Lusardi - 2013 - Systemic antimicrobial prophylaxis for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy.pdf","","","","Cochrane Wounds Group","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This prospective randomized study compares PEG with SG in terms of eﬀectiveness and safety. Methods: This study enrolled 70 patients with swallowing disorders, mainly attributable to neurologic impairment. All the patients, eligible for both techniques, were randomized to PEG (pull method) or SG. The groups were comparable in terms of age, body mass index, and underlying diseases. Complications were reported 7 and 30 days after the operative procedure. Results: The procedures were successfully completed for all the patients. The median operative time was 15min for PEG and 35min for SG ( p < 0.001). The rate of complications was lower for PEG (42.9%) than for SG (74.3%; p < 0.01). The 30-day mortality rates were 5.7% for PEG and 14.3% for SG (nonsigniﬁcant diﬀerence).

Consensus statements were developed to guide clinicians managing lung cancer screening programs and patients with lung nodules during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An expert panel of 24 members, including pulmonologists (n ¼ 17), thoracic radiologists (n ¼ 5), and thoracic surgeons (n ¼ 2), was formed. The panel was provided with an overview of current evidence, summarized by recent guidelines related to lung cancer screening and lung nodule evaluation. The panel was convened by video teleconference to discuss and then vote on statements related to 12 common clinical scenarios. A predeﬁned threshold of 70% of panel members voting agree or strongly agree was used to determine if there was a consensus for each statement. Items that may inﬂuence decisions were listed as notes to be considered for each scenario. RESULTS: Twelve statements related to baseline and annual lung cancer screening (n ¼ 2), surveillance of a previously detected lung nodule (n ¼ 5), evaluation of intermediate and high-risk lung nodules (n ¼ 4), and management of clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer (n ¼ 1) were developed and modiﬁed. All 12 statements were conﬁrmed as consensus statements according to the voting results. The consensus statements provide guidance about situations in which it was believed to be appropriate to delay screening, defer surveillance imaging of lung nodules, and minimize nonurgent interventions during the evaluation of lung nodules and stage I non-small cell lung cancer.

SVS showed an overall change of 0.03 L (–0.07 to 0.13, I2 = 90%) in the in FEV1 (L) and a 2.03% (–2.50 to 6.57, I2 = 96%) in the predicted FEV1 (%) compared to baseline; however, studies without collateral ventilation (CV) showed an improvement of 0.12 L (95% CI 0.09–0.015, I2 = 0%), This subgroup also reported better results in SGRQ –12.27 points (95% CI –15.84 to –8.70, I2 = 0%) and mMRC –0.54 (95% CI –0.74 to –0.33, I2 = 0%). We found no benefit in 6MWT mean difference = 4.56 m (95% CI –21.88 to 31.00, I2 = 73%). Relative risk of mortality was 2.54 (95% CI 0.81–7.96, I2 = 0%), for pneumothorax 3.3 (95% CI 0.61–18.12, I2 = 0%) and AECOPD 1.68 (95% CI 1.04–2.70, I2 = 0%). Conclusion: In patients with severe heterogeneous emphysema and hyperinflation without CV, SVS is an alternative that showed an improvement in pulmonary function, quality of life, and dyspnea score with an acceptable risk profile.","2020","2025-09-01 18:51:01","2025-09-01 18:51:01","2025-09-01 18:51:01","62-72","","1","99","","Respiration","Efficacy of the Spiration Valve System in Patients with Severe Heterogeneous Emphysema","","","","","","","en","https://karger.com/pages/terms-and-conditions","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/C75BIT9J/Majid et al. - 2020 - Efficacy of the Spiration Valve System in Patients with Severe Heterogeneous Emphysema A Systematic.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this study is to analyze the efﬁcacy and safety of IPC use in the management of refractory nonmalignant effusions. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the published literature. Retrospective cohort studies, case series, and reports that used IPCs for the management of pleural effusion were included in the study. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included in the analysis, with a total of 325 patients. Congestive heart failure (49.8%) was the most common cause of BPE requiring IPC placement. The estimated average rate of spontaneous pleurodesis was 51.3% (95% CI, 37.1%-65.6%). The estimated average rate of all complications was 17.2% (95% CI, 9.8%-24.5%) for the entire group. The estimated average rate of major complications included the following: empyema, 2.3% (95% CI, 0.0%-4.7%); loculation, 2.0% (95% CI, 0.0%4.7%); dislodgement, 1.3% (95% CI, 0.0%-3.7%); leakage, 1.3% (95% CI, 0.0%-3.5%); and pneumothorax, 1.2% (95% CI, 0.0%-4.1%). The estimated average rate of minor complications included the following: skin infection, 2.7% (95% CI, 0.6%-4.9%); blockage and drainage failure, 1.1% (95% CI, 0.0%-3.5%); subcutaneous emphysema, 1.1% (95% CI, 0.0%-4.0%); and other, 2.5% (95% CI, 0.0%-5.2%). One death was directly related to IPC use. CONCLUSIONS: IPCs are an effective and viable option in the management of patients with refractory BPE. The quality of evidence to support IPC use for BPE remains low, and highquality studies such as randomized controlled trials are needed.","2017-03","2025-09-01 18:51:03","2025-09-01 18:51:04","2025-09-01 18:51:03","626-635","","3","151","","CHEST","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/BBYPENWJ/Patil et al. - 2017 - Management of Benign Pleural Effusions Using Indwelling Pleural Catheters.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Depending on the etiology and severity, one can tailor the treatment modality and therapeutic intervention(s). The grading of severity of hemoptysis varies greatly in the literature; however, unlike hemorrhage in other scenarios, small amounts of blood can significantly impair oxygenation and ventilation leading to cardiovascular collapse. Importantly, the initial evaluation and management should focus on airway and hemodynamic stabilization along with maintenance of oxygenation and ventilation. In this review, we discuss commonly encountered etiologies, vascular anatomy, diagnostic evaluation, and therapeutic interventions. We examine the evolving trends in etiologies of life-threating hemoptysis over the years. The role of flexible and rigid bronchoscopy as both a diagnostic and therapeutic modality is explored, as well as the use and indications of several bronchoscopic techniques, such as topical hemostatic agents, endobronchial tamponade, and tranexamic acid (TXA). In addition, we assess the use of multi-row detector computed tomography as the initial rapid diagnostic method of choice and its use in planning for definitive treatment. The efficacy and long-term results of bronchial artery embolization (BAE) are evaluated, as well as indications for surgical intervention. Furthermore, the importance of a multidisciplinary approach is emphasized. The necessary interplay between intensivists, consultative services, and radiologists is described in detail and an algorithmic management strategy incorporating the above is outlined. Given the complexity in management of life-threatening hemoptysis, this paper aims to summarize the available diagnostic and therapeutic methods and provide a standardized approach for the management of patients with this often difficult to treat condition.","2021-08","2025-09-01 18:51:05","2025-09-01 18:51:05","2025-09-01 18:51:05","5139-5158","","8","13","","J Thorac Dis","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/FJ7FWAQ9/Charya et al. - 2021 - Management of life-threatening hemoptysis in the ICU.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this study was to compare main types of stents (silicone, balloon-dilated metal, self-expanding metal, and covered self-expanding metal) in terms of their mechanical properties and the radial forces they exert on the trachea. Mechanical measurements were carried out using a force gauge and specially designed adaptors fabricated in our lab. Numerical simulations were performed for eight different stent geometries, inserted into trachea models. The results show a clear correlation between stent diameter (oversizing) and the levels of stress it exerts on the trachea. Compared with uncovered metal stents, metal stents that are covered with less stiff material exert signiﬁcantly less stress on the trachea while still maintaining strong contact with it. The use of such stents may reduce formation of mucosa necrosis and ﬁstulas while still preventing stent migration. Silicone stents produce the lowest levels of stress, which may be due to weak contact between the stent and the trachea and can explain their propensity for migration. Unexpectedly, stents made of the same materials exerted different stresses due to differences in their structure. Stenosis signiﬁcantly increases stress levels in all stents.","2015-04","2025-09-01 18:51:12","2025-09-01 18:51:12","2025-09-01 18:51:12","408-415","","4","37","","Medical Engineering & Physics","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/4GXLIE2S/Ratnovsky et al. - 2015 - Mechanical properties of different airway stents.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A clear understanding of pathophysiology and existing classification systems is needed to determine the appropriate treatment options and predict clinical course. Clinically significant airway strictures can involve the upper and central airways extending from the subglottis to the lobar airways. Optimal evaluation includes a proper history and physical examination, neck and chest computed tomography, pulmonary function testing, endoscopy and serology. Available treatments include medical therapy, endoscopic procedures and open surgery which are based on the stricture’s extent, location, etiology, morphology, severity of airway narrowing and patient’s functional status. The acuity of the process, patient’s comorbidities and operability at the time of evaluation determine the need for open surgical or endoscopic interventions. The optimal management of patients with benign airway strictures requires the availability, expertise and collaboration of otolaryngologists, thoracic surgeons and interventional pulmonologists. Multidisciplinary airway teams can facilitate accurate diagnosis, guide management and avoid unnecessary procedures that could potentially worsen the extent of the disease or clinical course. Implementation of a complex airway program including multidisciplinary clinics and conferences ensures that such collaboration leads to timely, patient-centered and evidence-based interventions.

We aimed to establish benchmarks for complication rates in RTB. Methods: A multicentric retrospective analysis of RTB performed between 2009 and 2015 in eight participating centres was performed. Results: A total of 1546 RTB were performed over the study period. One hundred and thirty-one non-lethal complications occurred in 103 procedures (6.7%, 95% CI: 5.5–8.0%). The periprocedural mortality rate was 1.2% (95% CI: 0.6–1.8%). The 30-day mortality rate was 5.6% (95% CI: 4.5–6.8%). Complication rate increases further when procedures were performed in an emergency setting. Procedures in patients with MAO are associated with a higher 30-day mortality (8.1% vs 2.7%, P < 0.01) and a different complication proﬁle when compared to procedures performed for BAS.

We performed a literature and internet search for reports addressing seven clinically relevant PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome) questions pertaining to the management of adult patients with chylothorax. This consensus statement, consisting of best practice statements based on expert consensus addressing these seven PICO questions, was formulated by a systematic and rigorous process involving the evaluation of published evidence, augmented with provider experience. Panel members participated in the development of the final best practice statements using the modified Delphi technique. Our consensus statement aims to offer guidance in clinical decision making when managing patients with chylothorax while also identifying gaps in knowledge and informing future research.","2024-11","2025-09-01 18:51:25","2025-09-01 18:51:25","2025-09-01 18:51:25","2400470","","5","64","","Eur Respir J","Multidisciplinary management of adult patients with chylothorax","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/UP9DMUSU/Agrawal et al. - 2024 - Multidisciplinary management of adult patients with chylothorax a consensus statement.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, no studies have reported prospective 24-month follow-up from a large, multinational, generalizable cohort. This study evaluated ENB safety, diagnostic yield, and usage patterns in an unrestricted, real-world observational design. Methods: The NAVIGATE single-arm, pragmatic cohort study (NCT02410837) enrolled subjects at 37 academic and community sites in seven countries with prospective 24-month follow-up. Subjects underwent ENB using the superDimension navigation system versions 6.3 to 7.1. The prespeciﬁed primary end point was procedurerelated pneumothorax requiring intervention or hospitalization. Results: A total of 1388 subjects were enrolled for lung lesion biopsy (1329; 95.7%), ﬁducial marker placement (272; 19.6%), dye marking (23; 1.7%), or lymph node biopsy (36; 2.6%). Concurrent endobronchial ultrasoundguided staging occurred in 456 subjects. General anesthesia (78.2% overall, 56.6% Europe, 81.4% United States), radial endobronchial ultrasound (50.6%, 4.0%, 57.4%), ﬂuoroscopy (85.0%, 41.7%, 91.0%), and rapid onsite evaluation use (61.7%, 17.3%, 68.5%) differed between regions. Pneumothorax and bronchopulmonary hemorrhage occurred in 4.7% and 2.7% of subjects, respectively (3.2% [primary end point] and 1.7% requiring intervention or hospitalization). Respiratory failure occurred in 0.6%. The diagnostic yield was 67.8% (range: 61.9%–70.7%; 55.2% Europe, 69.8% United States). Sensitivity for malignancy was 62.6%. Lung cancer clinical stage was I to II in 64.7% (55.3% Europe, 65.8% United States). Conclusions: Despite a heterogeneous cohort and regional differences in procedural techniques, ENB demonstrates low complications and a 67.8% diagnostic yield while allowing biopsy, staging, ﬁducial placement, and dye marking in a single procedure.","2022-04","2025-09-01 18:51:28","2025-09-01 18:51:28","2025-09-01 18:51:28","519-531","","4","17","","Journal of Thoracic Oncology","NAVIGATE 24-Month Results","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/3JWJVJIK/Folch et al. - 2022 - NAVIGATE 24-Month Results Electromagnetic Navigation Bronchoscopy for Pulmonary Lesions at 37 Cente.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods An integrative review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines and was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024584812). The search included databases such as PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, encompassing studies published up to August 7, 2024. The inclusion criteria focused on human studies that utilized nebulized TXA for hemoptysis, with reported outcomes on bleeding cessation, recurrence, and adverse effects. Extracted data included patient demographics, underlying conditions, TXA dosing, administration methods, clinical outcomes, and reported adverse events. Results Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria: five original research studies, and nine case reports involving 13 patients. The majority of patients were older adults with underlying conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and infections. Nebulized TXA demonstrated high efficacy in controlling hemoptysis across studies, with most patients experiencing rapid cessation of bleeding. In a randomized controlled trial, 96% of patients receiving TXA achieved complete resolution of hemoptysis within five days, compared to 50% in the placebo group. TXA use was also associated with shorter hospital stays and a decreased need for invasive interventions. The safety profile of nebulized TXA was favorable. However, the long-term safety of nebulized TXA, remains unexplored. Conclusion Nebulized tranexamic acid appears to be an effective and safe non-invasive treatment option for hemoptysis, particularly in non-massive cases. It provides rapid control of bleeding and may reduce the requirement for invasive procedures. However, further large-scale randomized controlled trials are necessary to confirm these findings and to establish optimal dosing regimens.","2025-12","2025-09-01 18:51:34","2025-09-01 18:51:34","2025-09-01 18:51:34","28","","1","203","","Lung","Nebulized Tranexamic Acid in the Management of Hemoptysis","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/JEUJY6IJ/Ye et al. - 2025 - Nebulized Tranexamic Acid in the Management of Hemoptysis An Integrative Review.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is no data or guidance on the best airway hygiene regimen and consequently wide practice variation exists. Methods: This single-center, nonblinded, randomized, pilot study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of nebulized 3% saline (3%S) versus normal saline (NS) in reducing the incidence of mucus plugging in adult patients that undergo central airway stent placement. Patients were enrolled immediately after stent placement and randomized to nebulized 3%S or NS (3 mL) 3 times a day. Patients were scheduled for surveillance bronchoscopy in 4 to 6 weeks. Unscheduled bronchoscopies due to symptomatic mucus plugging were recorded. Results: From December 2022 to March 2024, 37 patients were screened, and 35 were enrolled. Four in the 3%S and 8 in the NS group did not undergo a surveillance bronchoscopy and were excluded from the ﬁnal analysis. During surveillance bronchoscopy for the 3%S (n = 13) and NS (n = 10) groups, obstructive mucus plugging was noted in 7.7% versus 40%, granulation requiring intervention in 7.7% versus 10%, and > 25% circumferential bioﬁlm in 0% versus 30%, respectively. In the 3%S versus NS groups, 0% versus 20% of patients required an unscheduled bronchoscopy due to mucus plugging. There were no side effects reported with the daily use of 3%S or NS. Conclusion: Nebulized 3%S is safe and may be equally or more effective than NS in preventing obstructive mucus plugging in patients who undergo airway stenting.

Although indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) have been used since 1997, there are no studies of quality-adjusted survival following IPC placement. Methods: With a standardized algorithm, this prospective observational cohort study of patients with MPE treated with IPCs assessed global health-related quality of life using the SF-6D to calculate utilities. Quality-adjusted life days (QALDs) were calculated by integrating utilities over time. Results: A total of 266 patients were enrolled. Median quality-adjusted survival was 95.1 QALDs. Dyspnea improved signiﬁcantly following IPC placement (P , .001), but utility increased only modestly. Patients who had chemotherapy or radiation after IPC placement (P , .001) and those who were more short of breath at baseline (P 5 .005) had greater improvements in utility. In a competing risk model, the 1-year cumulative incidence of events was death with IPC in place, 35.7%; IPC removal due to decreased drainage, 51.9%; and IPC removal due to complications, 7.3%. Recurrent MPE requiring repeat intervention occurred in 14% of patients whose IPC was removed. Recurrence was more common when IPC removal was due to complications (P 5 .04) or malfunction (P , .001) rather than to decreased drainage. Conclusions: IPC placement has signiﬁcant beneﬁcial effects in selected patient populations. The determinants of quality-adjusted survival in patients with MPE are complex. Although dyspnea is one of them, receiving treatment after IPC placement is also important. Future research should use patient-centered outcomes in addition to time-to-event analysis.","2014-06","2025-09-01 18:51:47","2025-09-01 18:51:48","2025-09-01 18:51:47","1347-1356","","6","145","","Chest","","","","","","","","en","https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/U97KFSM8/Ost et al. - 2014 - Quality-Adjusted Survival Following Treatment of Malignant Pleural Effusions With Indwelling Pleural.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We hypothesized that many patients have multiple thoracenteses rather than deﬁnitive procedures and that this results in more procedures and complications. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study using SEER-Medicare data from 2007 to 2011. Patients 66 to 90 years of age with an MPE were included. The primary outcome was whether patients with rapidly recurring MPE, deﬁned as recurrence within 2 weeks of ﬁrst thoracentesis, received guideline consistent care. Guideline consistent care was deﬁned as a deﬁnitive second pleural procedure. RESULTS: Thoracentesis for MPE was performed in 23,431 patients. A second pleural procedure because of recurrence was required in 12,967 (55%). Recurrence was rapid in 7,565 (58%) of the 12,967 patients that had a recurrence. Of the 7,565 patients with rapid recurrence, 1,811 (24%) received guideline consistent care. Deﬁnitive pleural procedures compared with repeat thoracentesis resulted in fewer subsequent pleural procedures (0.62 vs 1.44 procedures per patient, respectively; P < .0001), fewer pneumothoraxes (< 0.0037 vs 0.009 pneumothoraxes per patient, respectively; P ¼ .001), and fewer ED procedures (0.02 vs 0.04 ED procedures per patient, respectively; P < .001). Repeat thoracentesis and IPCs resulted in fewer inpatient days compared with chest tube or thoracoscopic pleurodesis (0.013 vs 0.013 vs 0.085 vs 0.097 inpatient days per day of life, respectively; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Guideline consistent care using deﬁnitive procedures compared with repeat thoracentesis was associated with fewer subsequent procedures and complications; however, pleurodesis resulted in more inpatient days.

Our objective was to compare indications, complications, efﬁcacy and outcomes of these two techniques. Methods: Records of 370 patients with feeding tubes placed either endoscopically by gastroenterology, or ﬂuoroscopically by radiology, at our university-based tertiary care center over a 54-month period were reviewed. Results: 177 gastrostomies were placed endoscopically and 193 ﬂuoroscopically. Nutrition was the most common indication in each group (94 and 92%), but the most common underlying diagnosis was neurologic impairment in the endoscopic group (n = 89, 50%) and malignancy in the ﬂuoroscopic group (n = 134, 69%) (p < 0.001). Complications in the ﬁrst 30 days were more common with ﬂuoroscopic placement (23% versus 11%, p = 0.002), with infection most frequent. Correlates of late complications were inpatient status (OR 0.26, 95%CI: 0.13–0.51) and a diagnosis of malignancy (OR 2.2, 95%CI: 1.03–4.84). Average follow-up time was 108 days in the ﬂuoroscopic group and 174 days in the endoscopic group. Conclusions: Both endoscopic and ﬂuoroscopic gastrostomy tube placement are safe and effective.

The use of PEG has evolved to be useful in many situations beyond degenerative neuromuscular disorders, with an increasing body of evidence supporting the advantages of PEG tubes in oncologic and pediatric patients. Risk factors for complications after PEG tube placement include acute and chronic conditions associated with malnutrition and several organic disorders. Patients suitable for PEG tube placement should be individually identiﬁed to implement the advantages of this technique while minimizing risk events. The safety of placing a PEG tube in patients under antithrombotic medication has been investigated, as well as the advantages of antibiotic prophylaxis in reducing peristomal infection. Evidence supports the safety of early feeding after placement, thus resulting in lower costs. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy-related complications are rare and mostly prevented by appropriate nursing care. Best medical practice and nursing care will ensure optimal performance leading to a wider acceptance, and greater utility of PEG by healthcare professionals, patients, and caregivers. This review aims to update knowledge relating to PEG tube indications, placement, management, and care in order to reinforce PEG feeding as the most valuable access for patients with a functional gastrointestinal system who have abnormalities in swallowing mechanisms.","2015","2025-09-01 18:51:58","2025-09-01 18:51:58","2025-09-01 18:51:58","354-366","","5","38","","Gastroenterology Nursing","Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/Q5FW4FNI/Friginal-Ruiz and Lucendo - 2015 - Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy A Practical Overview on Its Indications, Placement Conditions,.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: The current guidelines and medical literature applicable to this issue were identiﬁed by computerized search and were evaluated using standardized methods. Recommendations were framed using the approach described by the Guidelines Oversight Committee. Results: The preoperative physiologic assessment should begin with a cardiovascular evaluation and spirometry to measure the FEV1 and the diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO). Predicted postoperative (PPO) lung functions should be calculated. If the % PPO FEV1 and % PPO DLCO values are both . 60%, the patient is considered at low risk of anatomic lung resection, and no further tests are indicated. If either the % PPO FEV1 or % PPO DLCO are within 60% and 30% predicted, a low technology exercise test should be performed as a screening test. If performance on the low technology exercise test is satisfactory (stair climbing altitude . 22 m or shuttle walk distance . 400 m), patients are regarded as at low risk of anatomic resection. A cardiopulmonary exercise test is indicated when the PPO FEV1 or PPO DLCO (or both) are , 30% or when the performance of the stair-climbing test or the shuttle walk test is not satisfactory. A peak oxygen consumption ( O2peak) , 10 mL/kg/min or 35% predicted indicates a high risk of mortality and long-term disability for major anatomic resection. Conversely, a O2peak .20 mL/kg/min or 75% predicted indicates a low risk. Conclusions: A careful preoperative physiologic assessment is useful for identifying those patients at increased risk with standard lung cancer resection and for enabling an informed decision by the patient about the appropriate therapeutic approach to treating his or her lung cancer. This preoperative risk assessment must be placed in the context that surgery for early-stage lung cancer is the most effective currently available treatment of this disease.","2013-05","2025-09-01 18:52:01","2025-09-01 18:52:01","2025-09-01 18:52:01","e166S-e190S","","5","143","","Chest","","","","","","","","en","https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/RBWX97AC/Brunelli et al. - 2013 - Physiologic Evaluation of the Patient With Lung Cancer Being Considered for Resectional Surgery.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The AIRFLOW‑1 study assessed safety and TLD dose in patients with moderate‑to‑severe, symptomatic COPD. This analysis evaluated the long‑term impact of TLD on COPD exacerbations, pulmonary function, and quality of life over 3 years of follow up. Methods: TLD was performed in a prospective, energy‑level randomized (29 W vs 32 W power), multicenter study (NCT02058459). Additional patients were enrolled in an open label confirmation phase to confirm improved gastroin‑testinal safety after procedural modifications. Durability of TLD was evaluated at 1, 2, and 3 years post‑treatment and assessed through analysis of COPD exacerbations, pulmonary lung function, and quality of life. Results: Three‑year follow‑up data were available for 73.9% of patients (n = 34). The annualized rate of moderate to severe COPD exacerbations remained stable over the duration of the study. Lung function (FEV1, FVC, RV, and TLC) and quality of life (SGRQ‑C and CAT) remained stable over 3 years of follow‑up.

Important considerations include the respective diagnostic yields of thoracocentesis, closed pleural biopsy and thoracoscopy; the incremental gain in diagnostic yield when sequentially combining these investigations; and the role of various image modalities. The diagnostic yield of thoracocentesis is in the order of 60% for malignancy and >90% for tuberculosis. A second aspiration may increase the yield for malignancy, but a third is generally superﬂuous. Many authorities consider thoracoscopy the investigation of choice in exudative pleural effusions where a thoracocentesis was nondiagnostic and particularly when malignancy is suspected. It allows for the direct inspection of the pleura and for talc poudrage. Thoracoscopy has a diagnostic yield of 91–95% for malignant disease and as high as 100% for pleural tuberculosis. Access to thoracoscopy is, however, limited in many parts of the world, as signiﬁcant resources and expertise are required. Blind closed pleural biopsy has a yield of 80% for tuberculosis and <60% for pleural malignancy. Recent studies suggest that CT and/or ultrasound guidance may improve the yield, particularly for malignancy, where it may be as high as 88% and 83%, respectively. A second thoracocentesis combined with an image-assisted pleural biopsy with either an Abrams needle or cutting needle, depending on the setting, may therefore be an acceptable alternative to thoracoscopy. With such an approach, thoracoscopy may potentially be reserved for cases not diagnosed by means of closed pleural biopsy.","2011-07","2025-09-01 18:52:04","2025-09-01 18:52:04","2025-09-01 18:52:04","738-746","","5","16","","Respirology","Pleural controversy","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/DQMLHFKT/Koegelenberg and Diacon - 2011 - Pleural controversy Closed needle pleural biopsy or thoracoscopy—Which first.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cryobiopsy may provide greater tissue, increase depth of sampled tissue, and/or reduce crush artifact. However, its impact on diagnostic yield remains uncertain, and there are potential concerns regarding its safety too. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the same. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, and Google Scholar for studies evaluating the performance of pleural cryobiopsy, assessing the quality of each study using the Quality Assessment, Data Abstraction and Synthesis-2 tool. Using inverse variance weighting, we performed a meta-analysis of diagnostic yield estimations. We also reviewed specimen characteristics and complications related to the procedure. RESULTS: Seven observational studies involving 586 pleural biopsies (311 cryobiopsies and 275 ﬂexible forceps biopsies) were evaluated. All but one study used a semi-rigid thoracoscope. Meta-analysis generated a diagnostic yield of 96.5% for cryobiopsy and 93.1% for forceps biopsy with an inverse variance-weighted OR of 1.61 (95% CI, 0.71-3.66) and an I2 of 16%. No instances of moderate to severe bleeding were reported with cryobiopsy. A funnel plot illustrated no major publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: Based on analysis of relatively homogenous observational data, pleural cryobiopsy is safe but does not increase diagnostic yield over ﬂexible forceps biopsy. Adequately powered multicenter randomized trials are needed for further investigation.","2020-01","2025-09-01 18:52:06","2025-09-01 18:52:06","2025-09-01 18:52:06","223-230","","1","157","","Chest","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/G67MP73F/Shafiq et al. - 2020 - Pleural Cryobiopsy.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: Patients with stage IIIA and IIIB central NSCLC (main bronchus/distal trachea involvement) who were not initially eligible for surgery but might be considered as surgery candidates after neoadjuvant therapy were enrolled in the study. They were randomized to either neoadjuvant chemotherapy and endobronchial PDT or chemotherapy alone followed by surgical resection. PDT was done with photosensitizer agent chlorine E6 and 662 nm laser light before each of the three courses of chemotherapy. Results: From January 2008 to December 2011, 42 patients were assigned to PDT arm (n = 21) and No-PDT arm (n = 21). Groups were similar with respect to age, sex, tumor stage, and histology. No PDT major complications were observed. After neoadjuvant treatment partial response revealed in 19 pts (90%) in PDT arm and 16 pts (76%) in No-PDT arm (p = 0.460), these patients underwent thoracotomy. After thoracotomy tumor was unresectable in 3 pts of No-PDT arm (19%). There were 14 pneumonectomies and 5 lobectomies in PDT arm vs. 10 pneumonectomies and 3 lobectomies in No-PDT arm.

For lung cancer, an additional category encompasses situations in which the presence of residual tumor is uncertain.","2024-07","2025-09-01 18:52:14","2025-09-01 18:52:14","2025-09-01 18:52:14","1052-1072","","7","19","","Journal of Thoracic Oncology","The International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer Lung Cancer Staging Project","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/J3FX5HWQ/Detterbeck et al. - 2024 - The International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer Lung Cancer Staging Project Proposals fo.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our study was designed to demonstrate if a minimum pleural ﬂuid volume (10 mL) is equivalent to a large volume thoracentesis to make a cytopathologic diagnosis of malignancy. Methods: A total of 121 thoracentesis samples were obtained from 102 patients with suspected or known malignant effusions. Pleural ﬂuid was collected in three aliquots for cytologic examination (10 mL, 60 mL, 150 mL). The pathologist was blinded to patient identiﬁers and aliquot volume. Sensitivity, speciﬁcity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV) were calculated for each volume for the diagnosis of malignancy. Results: Pleural malignancy was diagnosed in 90 patient encounters (74.4%). For direct smear/ cytospin, there was increased sensitivity and NPV for 60 mL (P 5 .0058 and P 5 .045, respectively) and for 150 mL (P , .001 and P 5 .009, respectively) compared with 10 mL. For combined direct smear/cytospin and cell block preparations, statistical signiﬁcance for sensitivity and NPV existed only between the 10 mL and 150 mL specimens (P 5 .0099 and P 5 .033, respectively). No statistical difference existed for speciﬁcity or PPV for any aliquot volume. Conclusions: The sensitivity for diagnosis of pleural malignancy is dependent on the pleural ﬂuid volume extracted during thoracentesis. Volumes of 10 mL do not perform as well as larger volumes. When both direct smear/cytospin and cell block preparations are used, we recommend 150 mL, whereas when only direct smear/cytospin is used, 60 mL is adequate for the diagnosis a malignant pleural effusion.

This popularity links inextricably to an increase in ionizing radiation use. Knowing ionizing radiation is hazardous, knowledge and competent use of X-ray imaging and guidance systems are important. The globally implemented As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA) principle demands careful attention to minimize radiation exposure while achieving the precise goals of the intervention and imaging therein. To allow careful and targeted weighing of risk against reward while using X-ray based equipment, proper background knowledge of physics as well as imaging system aspects are needed. This white paper summarizes the principles of ionizing radiation which are crucial to enhance awareness and interpretation of dosimetric quantities. Consecutively, a consensus on standards for reporting radiation exposure in interventional pulmonology procedures is indicated to facilitate comparisons between different systems, approaches and results.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A 2×2 factorial phase 3 randomized clinical trial among 320 patients requiring pleurodesis in 16 UK hospitals from 2007 to 2013. INTERVENTIONS Patients undergoing thoracoscopy (n = 206; clinical decision if biopsy was required) received a 24F chest tube and were randomized to receive opiates (n = 103) vs NSAIDs (n = 103), and those not undergoing thoracoscopy (n = 114) were randomized to 1 of 4 groups (24F chest tube and opioids [n = 28]; 24F chest tube and NSAIDs [n = 29]; 12F chest tube and opioids [n = 29]; or 12F chest tube and NSAIDs [n = 28]). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Pain while chest tube was in place (0- to 100-mm visual analog scale [VAS] 4 times/d; superiority comparison) and pleurodesis efficacy at 3 months (failure defined as need for further pleural intervention; noninferiority comparison; margin, 15%). RESULTS Pain scores in the opiate group (n = 150) vs the NSAID group (n = 144) were not significantly different (mean VAS score, 23.8 mm vs 22.1 mm; adjusted difference, −1.5 mm; 95% CI, −5.0 to 2.0 mm; P = .40), but the NSAID group required more rescue analgesia (26.3% vs 38.1%; rate ratio, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.3-3.4; P = .003). Pleurodesis failure occurred in 30 patients (20%) in the opiate group and 33 (23%) in the NSAID group, meeting criteria for noninferiority (difference, −3%; 1-sided 95% CI, −10% to ; P = .004 for noninferiority). Pain scores were lower among patients in the 12F chest tube group (n = 54) vs the 24F group (n = 56) (mean VAS score, 22.0 mm vs 26.8 mm; adjusted difference, −6.0 mm; 95% CI, −11.7 to −0.2 mm; P = .04) and 12F chest tubes vs 24F chest tubes were associated with higher pleurodesis failure (30% vs 24%), failing to meet noninferiority criteria (difference, −6%; 1-sided 95% CI, −20% to ; P = .14 for noninferiority). Complications during chest tube insertion occurred more commonly with 12F tubes (14% vs 24%; odds ratio, 1.91; P = .20). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Use of NSAIDs vs opiates resulted in no significant difference in pain scores but was associated with more rescue medication. NSAID use resulted in noninferior rates of pleurodesis efficacy at 3 months. Placement of 12F chest tubes vs 24F chest tubes was associated with a statistically significant but clinically modest reduction in pain but failed to meet noninferiority criteria for pleurodesis efficacy.","2015-12-22","2025-09-01 18:52:19","2025-09-01 18:52:19","2025-09-01 18:52:19","2641","","24","314","","JAMA","Effect of Opioids vs NSAIDs and Larger vs Smaller Chest Tube Size on Pain Control and Pleurodesis Efficacy Among Patients With Malignant Pleural Effusion","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/J82EQLUE/Rahman et al. - 2015 - Effect of Opioids vs NSAIDs and Larger vs Smaller Chest Tube Size on Pain Control and Pleurodesis Ef.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study intends to evaluate the effectiveness of the RPP in inducing pleurodesis in patients with pleural effusions from either malignant or benign etiologies. Methods: In this single-center, retrospective cohort study spanning 2 decades, we assessed patients with recurrent symptomatic chronic noninfectious pleural effusion, both benign and malignant. PostRPP, chest tubes were removed when ﬂuid output dropped below 150 mL/d, and patients were discharged with daily indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) drainage. Exclusion criteria included nonexpandable lung and active pleural infection. Treatment success was deﬁned as IPC removal on reduced output ( < 50 mL) on 3 consecutive drainages and radiologic effusion resolution. Recurrence was deﬁned as the occurrence of pleural effusion requiring additional pleural procedures postsuccess. Duration outcome was expressed as median with IPC placement as time zero. Results: Of the 210 patients studied, 72% had MPE, and 28% had benign effusions. The median hospital stay was 4 days post-RPP. Treatment was successful in 177 (84%) patients within a median of 12 days, with no signiﬁcant differences between MPE and benign cases. Nine patients (5%) experienced recurrence within a median of 152 days. Complications included hemothorax in 4 (1.9%) and empyema in 2 (1%). The thirty-day mortality rate was 9%, with a median survival time of 245 days postprocedure. Conclusion: The RPP combines the beneﬁt of chemical pleurodesis and IPC and appears to be a reasonable option for patients with recurrent and symptomatic pleural effusion.","2025-01","2025-09-01 18:52:25","2025-09-01 18:52:25","2025-09-01 18:52:25","","","1","32","","","Rapid Pleurodesis in Patients With Chronic Noninfectious Pleural Effusion","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/KX87TM2S/Pu et al. - 2025 - Rapid Pleurodesis in Patients With Chronic Noninfectious Pleural Effusion Twenty Years of Real-worl.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Percutaneous tracheostomy (PT) is now routinely performed by surgeons and non-surgeons such as intensivists and anesthesiologists in the intensive care units (ICU) all over the world. Although obesity, emergent tracheostomy, coagulopathy, inability to extend the neck and high ventilator demand (HVD) were initially thought to be a relative contraindication, recent data suggest safety of PT in these patient population. Ultrasound can be helpful in limited cases to identify the neck structure especially in patients with a difficult anatomy. Bronchoscopy during PT can shorten the duration and avoid complications.

Despite decades of effort, evidence suggests that the diagnostic accuracy for electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy (EMN) and radial endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) approach only 50%. New developments in robotic bronchoscopy (RB) may offer improvements in the assessment of PPNs. METHODS: A prospective single-blinded randomized controlled comparative study to assess success in localization and puncture of PPNs, using an ultrathin bronchoscope with radial EBUS (UTB-rEBUS) vs EMN vs RB in a human cadaver model of PPNs < 2 cm, was performed. The primary end point was the ability to successfully localize and puncture the target nodule, veriﬁed by cone-beam CT comparing RB and EMN. Secondary end points included needle to target position “miss” distance, and UTB-rEBUS comparisons. RESULTS: Sixty procedures were performed to target 20 PPNs over the study period. Implanted PPNs were distributed across all lobes, with 80% located within the lung periphery. The target PPN mean diameter was 16.5 1.5 mm, with 50% noted to have a CT bronchus sign. The rate of successful PPN localization and puncture was superior when using RB, compared with EMN (80% vs 45%; P ¼ .02). Among unsuccessful needle passes, the median needle to target “miss” distance was signiﬁcantly different when comparing UTB-rEBUS, EMN, and RB (P ¼ .0014). CONCLUSIONS: In a cadaver model, use of RB signiﬁcantly increased the ability to localize and successfully puncture small PPNs when compared with existing technologies. This study demonstrates the potential of RB to precisely reach, localize, and puncture small nodules in the periphery of the lung.

Fineneedle sampling without suction (capillary sampling) has been studied for endoscopic ultrasound and for biopsies at various body sites and has resulted in similar diagnostic yield and fewer traumatic samples. However, the role of EBUS-guided transbronchial needle capillary sampling (EBUS-TBNCS) is still to be determined. Methods: Adults with suspicious hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes (LNs) were included in a singleblinded, prospective, randomized trial comparing EBUS-TBNA and EBUS-TBNCS. The primary end point was the concordance rate between the two techniques in terms of adequacy and diagnosis of cytologic samples. The secondary end point was the concordance rate between the two techniques in terms of quality of samples. Results: A total of 115 patients and 192 LNs were studied.

RP is a systemic auto-immune disease that mainly affects cartilage structures, progressing through inflammatory flare-ups between phases of remission and ultimately leading to deformation of the involved cartilages. Besides the damage of auricular or nasal cartilage, tracheobronchial and cardiac involvement are the most severe, and can seriously alter the prognosis. Tracheobronchial lesions are assessed through a multimodal approach. Mapping of tracheal lesions is achieved using dynamic thoracic imaging and flexible bronchoscopy. Measurement of pulmonary function (with new emphasis on pulse oscillometry) is useful to diagnose obstructive ventilatory impairment, and can be used to follow RP patients, after therapeutics implementation. Diagnosis can be difficult in the absence of specific diagnostic tools, especially because there is a large number of differential diagnoses, in particular inflammatory diseases. Nuclear imaging can help with detection of metabolic activity on involved cartilages, leading to sharpen the final diagnosis. The prognosis has improved, thanks to the upgraded interventional bronchoscopy techniques, and the development of immunosuppressant including targeted therapies, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) inhibitors, offering patients several treatment options, in addition to supportive care.","2025-01","2025-09-01 18:52:35","2025-09-01 18:52:35","2025-09-01 18:52:35","461-475","","1","17","","J Thorac Dis","Relapsing polychondritis","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/G358798L/Grandière et al. - 2025 - Relapsing polychondritis tracheobronchial involvement and differential diagnoses.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, to our knowledge, no studies have quantiﬁed the incidence rate of long-term complications for different stents. Methods: To compare the incidence of complications of different airway stents, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients at our institution who had airway stenting for malignant airway obstruction from January 2005 to August 2010. Patients were excluded if more than one type of stent was in place at the same time. Complications recorded were lower respiratory tract infections, stent migration, granulation tissue, mucus plugging requiring intervention, tumor overgrowth, and stent fracture. Results: One hundred seventy-two patients with 195 stent procedures were included. Aero stents were associated with an increased risk of infection (hazard ratio [HR] 5 1.98; 95% CI, 1.03-3.81; P 5 .041). Dumon silicone tube stents had an increased risk of migration (HR 5 3.52; 95% CI, 1.41-8.82; P 5 .007). Silicone stents (HR 5 3.32; 95% CI, 1.59-6.93; P 5 .001) and lower respiratory tract infections (HR 5 5.69; 95% CI, 2.60-12.42; P , .001) increased the risk of granulation tissue. Lower respiratory tract infections were associated with decreased survival (HR 5 1.57; 95% CI, 1.11-2.21; P 5 .011). Conclusions: Signiﬁcant differences exist among airway stents in terms of infection, migration, and granulation tissue formation. These complications, in turn, are associated with signiﬁcant morbidity and mortality. Granulation tissue formation develops because of repetitive motion trauma and infection.

To date, there has been limited information on the long-term outcome of patients treated with PDT, especially those who are medically operable. Methods: Beginning in 1994, patients with roentgenographically occult bronchogenic squamous cell carcinoma (ROSCC) who met our criteria underwent PDT at Tohoku University Hospital and were followed up through 2006. Our criteria were as follows: (1) ROSCC without distant metastasis; (2) medically operable by means of lobectomy or further resection; (3) longitudinal tumor length of < 10 mm; and (4) superficial bronchoscopic tumor findings. Results: A total of 48 patients with ROSCC underwent PDT. The complete response (CR) rate was 94% (45 of 48 of patients). Nine patients (20%) had local recurrence after CR. A total of 11 deaths was observed, with 6 resulting from multiple primary lung cancer and only 1 from the original ROSCC. The 5-year and 10-year overall survival rates for all 48 patients were 81% and 71%, respectively. The Cox proportional hazard model showed that only metachronous multiple primary lung cancer was an independent poor prognostic factor. Conclusions: PDT is thought to be a first-line modality for patients who have ROSCC with a tumor length of < 10 mm, even if the tumor is medically operable. Most local recurrence can be cured by active therapy such as surgery, radiotherapy, or PDT. Multiple primary lung cancer subsequent to PDT is an important issue from the viewpoint of survival.","2009-08","2025-09-01 18:52:38","2025-09-01 18:52:38","2025-09-01 18:52:38","369-375","","2","136","","Chest","","","","","","","","en","https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/VA2JSB8N/Endo et al. - 2009 - Results of Long-term Follow-up of Photodynamic Therapy for Roentgenographically Occult Bronchogenic.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rigid bronchoscopy is an invaluable tool in the diagnosis and management of several malignant and non-malignant causes of central airway obstruction (CAO) and has become integral after the inception of airway stenting. The management of CAO can be a complicated endeavor with significant risks making the understanding of basic rigid bronchoscopy techniques, ablative technologies, anesthetic care and stenting of utmost importance in the care of these complex patients. This review article will focus on the history of rigid bronchoscopy, the technical aspects of performing a rigid bronchoscopy as well as the use of silicone stents their indications, complications and placement techniques.","","2025-09-01 18:52:44","2025-09-01 18:52:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/SLUX5F2A/Semaan and Yarmus - Rigid bronchoscopy and silicone stents in the management of central airway obstruction.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The authors compared rigid mini-thoracoscopy with semirigid thoracoscopy for thoracoscopic pleural biopsy. Methods: Consecutive subjects with undiagnosed exudative pleural effusion were randomized (1:1 ratio) to minithoracoscopy or semirigid thoracoscopy groups. The primary objective was a comparison of the diagnostic yield of pleural biopsy. Key secondary outcomes were the comparison of sedative/analgesic dose, operator-rated and patient-rated pain on visual analog scale (VAS), operatorrated overall procedural satisfaction (VAS), pleural biopsy size, and complications between the groups. Results: Of the 88 screened subjects, 73 were randomized: 36 to mini-thoracoscopy and 37 to semirigid thoracoscopy. Diagnostic yield of pleural biopsy in the minithoracoscopy (69.4%) and semirigid thoracoscopy groups (81.1%) was similar on intention-to-treat analysis (P = 0.25). Although the operator-rated overall procedure satisfaction scores were similar between groups (P = 0.87), operator-rated pain [VAS (mean ± SD), 43.5 ± 16.7 vs. 31.7 ± 15.8; P < 0.001] and patient-rated pain (VAS, 41.9 ± 17.3 vs. 32.1 ± 16.5; P = 0.02) scores were greater in the mini-thoracoscopy group. Mean dose of fentanyl and midazolam received was similar between the 2 groups (P = 0.28 and 0.68, respectively). Biopsy size was larger in the mini-thoracoscopy group (16.1 ± 4.5 vs. 8.3 ± 2.9 mm; P < 0.001). Three minor complications occurred in the mini-thoracoscopy group and 6 in the semirigid thoracoscopy group (P = 0.11). There were no serious adverse events or procedure-related mortality. Conclusion: Diagnostic yield of rigid mini-thoracoscopy is not superior to semirigid thoracoscopy. Use of semirigid thoracoscope may provide greater patient comfort.","2020-07","2025-09-01 18:52:48","2025-09-01 18:52:48","2025-09-01 18:52:48","163-171","","3","27","","","Rigid Mini-Thoracoscopy Versus Semirigid Thoracoscopy in Undiagnosed Exudative Pleural Effusion","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/4Z4RV6RT/Bansal et al. - 2020 - Rigid Mini-Thoracoscopy Versus Semirigid Thoracoscopy in Undiagnosed Exudative Pleural Effusion The.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our objective is to report on the initial post-marketing feasibility, safety and diagnostic yield of this technology. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed data on consecutive cases in which robot-assisted bronchoscopy was used to sample lung lesions at four centers in the US (academic and community) from June 15th, 2018 to December 15th, 2018. Results: One hundred and sixty-seven lesions in 165 patients were included in the analysis, with an average followup of 185 ± 55 days. The average size of target lesions was 25.0 ± 15.0 mm. Seventy-one percent were located in the peripheral third of the lung. Pneumothorax and airway bleeding occurred in 3.6 and 2.4% cases, respectively. Navigation was successful in 88.6% of cases.

Methods: Retrospective chart reviews of 39 patients of laryngotracheal stenosis managed by T-tube stenting for temporary or deﬁnitive treatment during the period 2004–2011 were considered. The data on indications for stenting, type of stent, problems/complications of stenting, duration of stenting, additional intervention and outcome of management were collected, tabulated and analyzed. Results: Of the 51 cases of laryngotracheal stenosis 39 patients were treated by Montgomery T-tube stenting. There was no mortality associated with the procedure or stenting. 82% of the patients were successfully decannulated. The problems and complications encountered were crusting within the tube in 44% and granulation at the subglottis in 33%. Two patients had complication due to T-tube itself: One patient developed tracheomalacia and the other had stenosis at both ends of the T-tube. Conclusion: Stenting still has a role in management of inoperable or in some deadlock situations where resection anastomosis is not feasible. It is easier to introduce the stent and to maintain it.

Electronic systems with continuous digital monitoring of air leakage provide better insight into actual air leakage and changes in leakage over time, which may lead to a shorter length of hospital stay. Methods: We performed a randomized controlled trial comparing the digital with analogue system, with the aim of demonstrating that use of a digital drainage system in PSP leads to a shorter hospital stay. Results: In 102 patients enrolled with PSP we found no differences in total duration of chest tube drainage and hospital stay between the groups. However, in a post-hoc analysis, excluding 19 patients needing surgery due to prolonged air leakage, hospital stay was significantly shorter in the digital group (median 1 days, IQR 1–5 days) compared to the analogue group (median 3 days, IQR 2–5 days) (p 0.014). Treatment failure occurred in 3 patients in both groups; the rate of recurrence within 12 weeks was not significantly different between groups (16% in the digital group versus 8% in the analogue group, p 0.339). Conclusion: Length of hospital stay was not shorter in patients with PSP when applying a digital drainage system compared to an analogue drainage system. However, in the large subgroup of uncomplicated PSP, a significant reduction in duration of drainage and hospital stay was demonstrated with digital drainage. These findings suggest that digital drainage may be a practical alternative to manual aspiration in the management of PSP.

This procedure has since expanded beyond the realm of surgeons to include gastroenterologists, thoracic surgeons, and interventional radiologists. In some academic centers, interventional pulmonologists (IPs) also perform this procedure. We describe the safety and feasibility of PEG tube placement by IPs in a critically ill population. Methods: Prospectively collected data of patients in a medical ICU undergoing PEG tube placement from 2003 to 2007 at a tertiary-care center were reviewed. Inclusion criteria included all PEG tube insertions performed or attempted by the IP team. Data were collected on mortality, PEG tube removal rate, total number of days with PEG tube, and complication rates. Follow-up included hospital length of stay and phone contact after discharge. Procedural and long-term PEG-related complications were recorded. Results: Seventy-two patients were studied. PEG tube insertion was completed successfully in 70 (97.2%), with follow-up data in 69 of these 70. Thirty-day mortality was 11.7%. No deaths or immediate complications were attributed to PEG tube placement. PEG tube removal occurred in 27 patients, with a median time to removal of 76 days. Conclusions: Bedside PEG tube placement can be performed safely and effectively by trained IPs. Because percutaneous tracheostomy is currently performed by IPs, the ability to place both PEG and tracheostomy tubes at the same time has the potential for decreased costs, anesthesia exposure, procedural times, ventilator times, and ICU days.

We compared the safety and outcomes of 3 techniques for performing a gastrostomy: percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), ﬂuoroscopy-guided gastrostomy by an interventional radiologist (IR-gastrostomy), and open gastrostomy performed by a surgeon (surgical gastrostomy). Methods: Using the Nationwide Readmissions Database, we identiﬁed hospitalized patients who underwent a gastrostomy from 2016 to 2017. They were identiﬁed using the International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, 10th Revision, Procedure Coding System. The selected patients were divided into 3 cohorts: PEG (0DH64UZ), IRgastrostomy (0DH63UZ), and open surgical gastrostomy (0DH60UZ). Adjusted odds ratios for adverse events associated with each technique were calculated using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results: Of the 184,068 patients meeting the selection criteria, the route of gastrostomy tube placement was as follows: PEG, 16,384 (53.7 29.0 years); IR-gastrostomy, 154,007 (67.2 17.5 years); and surgical gastrostomy, 13,677 (57.9 24.3 years). Compared with PEG, the odds for colon perforation using IR-gastrostomy and surgical gastrostomy, respectively, were 1.90 (95% conﬁdence interval [CI], 1.26-2.86; P Z .002) and 6.65 (95% CI, 4.38-10.12; P < .001), for infection of the gastrostomy 1.28 (95% CI, 1.07-1.53; P Z .006) and 1.61 (95% CI, 1.29-2.01; P < .001), for hemorrhage requiring blood transfusion 1.84 (95% CI, 1.26-2.68; P Z .002) and 1.09 (95% CI, .64-1.86; P Z .746), for nonelective 30-day readmission 1.07 (95% CI, 1.03-1.12; P Z .0023) and 1.13 (95% CI, 1.06-1.2; P Z .0002), and for inpatient mortality 1.09 (95% CI, 1.02-1.17; P Z .0114) and 1.55 (95% CI, 1.42-1.69; P < .0001).

We report our single-center experience on the safety and clinical utility of cryoprobe extraction for this indication. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review from January 2006 to November 2014 of all subjects aged 18 and older who underwent ﬂexible bronchoscopic cryoprobe extraction. Subjects with obstruction due to benign or malignant neoplasm or airway stenosis were excluded. Results: A total of 38 cryotherapy sessions performed on 30 subjects were identiﬁed for inclusion. Cryoprobe extraction was successful in reestablishing airway patency in 32/38 (84%) sessions overall and in 24/26 (92%) for blood clots, 4/6 (67%) for mucous plugging, 2/4 (50%) for foreign bodies, and 2/2 (100%) for plastic bronchitis. Twenty-one of 31 (68%) sessions resulted in improvement in oxygenation or ventilation. There was 1 complication related to sedation. Conclusions: We conclude that ﬂexible bronchoscopic cryoprobe extraction of blood clots, mucous secretions, plastic bronchitis, and foreign bodies is a safe and eﬀective option.

Complications related to rigid bronchoscopy are uncommon in the hands of trained physicians. Traditionally, rigid bronchoscopy is performed in the operating room rather than the bronchoscopy suite based on the availability of advanced airway equipment and additional anesthesia support. This study assesses the safety and feasibility of performing rigid bronchoscopy on non-critically ill patients in the bronchoscopy suite. The aim of this study is to determine the safety of performing rigid bronchoscopy in a bronchoscopy suite, outside of an operating room setting. Methods: This is a retrospective, single-center analysis of 372 rigid bronchoscopy procedures performed for complex airway interventions in the bronchoscopy suite over a 5-year period. The primary endpoint of this study was the safety of performing rigid bronchoscopy in the bronchoscopy suite. In this analysis, safety data was collected regarding intraoperative and post-operative complications of rigid bronchoscopies performed in the bronchoscopy suite. Results: Over a 5-year period between January 2019 and March 2024, 372 rigid bronchoscopies were performed in the bronchoscopy suite for non-emergent complex airway diseases. The overall incidence of intraprocedural complications in our cohort was 2 out of 372 procedures (0.5%). The two intraprocedural complications were pulmonary hemorrhage in 1 patient and cardiac ischemia in 1 patient. No incidence of airway injury, cardiac arrest, or death were observed. Seven procedures (1.9%) were followed by a change in clinical status requiring increased respiratory support within 24 hours of the rigid bronchoscopy. Conclusions: Rigid bronchoscopy for the treatment of complex airway diseases, in the appropriate patient population, can be performed safely in the bronchoscopy suite.","2025-06","2025-09-01 18:53:23","2025-09-01 18:53:23","2025-09-01 18:53:23","3667-3672","","6","17","","J Thorac Dis","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/Z8GEX2FM/Mahajan et al. - 2025 - Safety and feasibility of performing rigid bronchoscopy in the bronchoscopy suite instead of the ope.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aimed to review the safety and feasibility of the IPC in patients with refractory HH. METHODS: A retrospective multicenter study of patients with HH from January 2010 to December 2016 was performed. Inclusion criteria were refractory HH treated with an IPC and an underlying diagnosis of cirrhosis. Records were reviewed for patient demographics, operative reports, and laboratory values. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate catheter time to removal. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to evaluate for independent predictors of pleurodesis and death. RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients were identiﬁed from eight institutions. Indication for IPC placement was palliation in 58 patients (73%) and bridge to transplant in 21 patients (27%). The median in situ dwell time of all catheters was 156 days (range, 16-1,978 days). Eight patients (10%) were found to have pleural space infection, ﬁve of whom also had catheter-site cellulitis. Two patients (2.5%) died secondary to catheter-related sepsis. Catheter removal secondary to spontaneous pleurodesis was achieved in 22 patients (28%). Median time from catheter insertion to pleurodesis was 55 days (range, 10-370 days). Older age was an independent predictor of mortality on multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 1.05; P ¼ .01). CONCLUSIONS: We present, to our knowledge, the ﬁrst multicenter study examining outcomes related to IPC use in HH. Ten percent infection risk and 2.5% mortality were identiﬁed.

This study evaluated the accuracy of an integrated proteomic classiﬁer in identifying benign nodules in patients with a pretest probability of cancer (pCA) # 50%. METHODS: A prospective, multicenter observational trial of 685 patients with 8- to 30-mm lung nodules was conducted. Multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry was used to measure the relative abundance of two plasma proteins, LG3BP and C163A. Results were integrated with a clinical risk prediction model to identify likely benign nodules. Sensitivity, speciﬁcity, and negative predictive value were calculated. Estimates of potential changes in invasive testing had the integrated classiﬁer results been available and acted on were made. RESULTS: A subgroup of 178 patients with a clinician-assessed pCA # 50% had a 16% prevalence of lung cancer. The integrated classiﬁer demonstrated a sensitivity of 97% (CI, 82-100), a speciﬁcity of 44% (CI, 36-52), and a negative predictive value of 98% (CI, 92-100) in distinguishing benign from malignant nodules. The classiﬁer performed better than PET, validated lung nodule risk models, and physician cancer probability estimates (P < .001). If the integrated classiﬁer results were used to direct care, 40% fewer procedures would be performed on benign nodules, and 3% of malignant nodules would be misclassiﬁed. CONCLUSIONS: When used in patients with lung nodules with a pCA # 50%, the integrated classiﬁer accurately identiﬁes benign lung nodules with good performance characteristics. If used in clinical practice, invasive procedures could be reduced by diverting benign nodules to surveillance.","2018-09","2025-09-01 18:53:40","2025-09-01 18:53:40","2025-09-01 18:53:40","491-500","","3","154","","Chest","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/ZINU5N3G/Silvestri et al. - 2018 - Assessment of Plasma Proteomics Biomarker’s Ability to Distinguish Benign From Malignant Lung Nodule.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The technique is suitable in a broad range of patients with emphysema; however, patients with paraseptal emphysema, large focal (giant) bullae, significant co-morbidity and airway-predominant disease should be avoided. Treatment involves placing between 10 and 14 coils by bronchoscopy in the selected treatment lobe, with 2 lobes being treated sequentially. Lobe selection for treatment should be based on quantitative computed tomography, and the lobes with the greatest destruction should be targeted (excluding the right middle lobe). The treatment results in an improvement in pulmonary function, exercise performance and quality of life, particularly in patients with severe hyperinflation (residual volume &#x3e; 200% predicted) and upper-lobe heterogeneous emphysema, but will also be of benefit in lower-lobe predominant and homogeneous emphysema.

It has been reported by meta-analyses to be an independent prognostic factor in the major histologic types of lung cancer, but its role in lung cancer staging is not established. Methods: To assess the clinical importance of STAS in lung cancer staging, we evaluated 4061 surgically resected pathologic stage I R0 NSCLC collected from around the world in the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer database. We focused on whether STAS could be a useful additional histologic descriptor to supplement the existing ones of visceral pleural invasion (VPI) and lymphovascular invasion (LVI). Results: STAS was found in 930 of 4061 of the pathologic stage I NSCLC (22.9%). Patients with tumors exhibiting STAS had a signiﬁcantly worse recurrence-free and overall survival in both univariate and multivariable analyses involving cohorts consisting of all NSCLC, speciﬁc histologic types (adenocarcinoma and other NSCLC), and extent of resection (lobar and sublobar). Interestingly, STAS was independent of VPI in all of these analyses. Conclusions: These data support our recommendation to include STAS as a histologic descriptor for the Ninth Edition of the TNM Classiﬁcation of Lung Cancer. Hopefully, gathering these data in the coming years will facilitate a thorough analysis to better understand the relative impact of STAS, LVI, and VPI on lung cancer staging for the Tenth Edition TNM Stage Classiﬁcation.","2024-07","2025-09-01 18:53:43","2025-09-01 18:53:43","2025-09-01 18:53:43","1028-1051","","7","19","","Journal of Thoracic Oncology","The International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) Staging Project for Lung Cancer","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/ZXCFEE8P/Travis et al. - 2024 - The International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) Staging Project for Lung Cancer.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The robust innovation in technology demands standardization in IP training with both disease and technology driven training. Simulation based training should be considered a part of IP training as seen in other procedural and surgical subspecialties. Procedure volume is a component of training; however, this does not guarantee or translate into competency for learners. Basic competency skills can be assessed using standardized well validated assessment tools designed for various IP procedures including flexible bronchoscopy, endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS TBNA), rigid bronchoscopy and chest tube placement; however, further work is needed to validate tools in all procedures as new technologies are introduced beyond fellowship training. Currently there are at least 39 IP fellowship programs in the United States (US) and Canada which has led to improved training by accreditation of programs who meet rigorous requirements of standardized curriculum and procedural volume. The challenge is to be innovative in how we teach globally with intention and how to best integrate new evolving technology training for those not only during fellowship training but also beyond fellowship training.","2020-06","2025-09-01 18:53:48","2025-09-01 18:53:48","2025-09-01 18:53:48","3331-3340","","6","12","","J Thorac Dis","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/H2ZF63PQ/Aslam et al. - 2020 - Standardizing education in interventional pulmonology in the midst of technological change.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Preclinical data suggest potential for BTVA in minimally invasive ablation of lung cancer lesions. Objectives: The objective of this study is to establish the safety, feasibility, and ablative efficacy of BTVA for minimally invasive ablation of lung cancers. Methods: Single arm treat-and-resect clinical feasibility study of patients with biopsy-confirmed lung cancer. A novel BTVA for lung cancer (BTVA-C) system for minimally invasive treatment of peripheral pulmonary tumours was used to deliver 330 Cal thermal vapour energy via bronchoscopy to target lesion. Patients underwent planned lobectomy to complete oncologic care. Pre-surgical CT chest and post-resection histologic analysis were performed to evaluate ablative efficacy. Results: Six patients underwent BTVA-C, and 5 progressed to planned lobectomy. Median procedure duration was 12 min. No major procedure-related complications occurred. All 5 resected lesions were part-solid lung adenocarcinomas with median solid component size 1.32±0.36 cm. Large uniform ablation zones were seen in 4 patients where thermal dose exceeded 3 Cal/mL, with complete/near-complete necrosis of target lesions seen in 2 patients. Tumour positioned within ablation zones demonstrated necrosis in >99% of cross-sectional area examined. Conclusion: BTVA of lung tumours is feasible and well tolerated, with preliminary evidence suggesting high potential for effective ablation of tumours. Thermal injury is well demarcated, and uniform tissue necrosis is observed within ablation zones receiving sufficient thermal dose per volume of lung. Treatment of smaller volumes and ensuring adequate thermal dose may be important for ablative efficacy.","2021","2025-09-01 18:53:52","2025-09-01 18:53:52","2025-09-01 18:53:52","432-442","","5","100","","Respiration","Bronchoscopic Thermal Vapour Ablation for Localized Cancer Lesions of the Lung","","","","","","","en","https://karger.com/pages/terms-and-conditions","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/QBUESZZQ/Steinfort et al. - 2021 - Bronchoscopic Thermal Vapour Ablation for Localized Cancer Lesions of the Lung A Clinical Feasibili.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, practices vary widely institutionally and regionally, and evidencebased guidelines are lacking. METHODS The Society of Thoracic Surgeons assembled a panel of thoracic surgical oncologists to evaluate and synthesize the available evidence regarding the role of pulmonary resection as LCT. Clinical and research questions of interest were identiﬁed, and a complete literature review was conducted. Best practice guidelines were developed accordingly. RESULTS The panel identiﬁed 7 areas of controversy, and data were assimilated to support the best recommended practices related to these clinical issues. Ultimately, a number of issues in this realm were found to have a high level of evidence to support the role for surgical therapy in patients with stage IV lung cancer. However, the nuances of how these operations are conducted remain in equipoise, without ample evidence to support the extent of resection or nodal dissection. CONCLUSIONS Clear data exist to support the use of surgical resection of the primary lung tumor as LCT in stage IV lung cancer. Evidence-based recommendations have been provided to guide multidisciplinary teams on the implementation of treatment plans as well as to guide researchers on areas of ongoing need for further investigation.","2025-03","2025-09-01 18:53:54","2025-09-01 18:53:54","2025-09-01 18:53:54","495-508","","3","119","","The Annals of Thoracic Surgery","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/T993BA6Y/Antonoff et al. - 2025 - The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Clinical Practice Guideline on Surgical Management of Oligome.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Multiple diagnostic options are available, ranging from radiographic surveillance, minimally invasive biopsy (bronchoscopy or transthoracic biopsy) to more invasive surgical biopsy/resection. Each technique has diﬀerences in diagnostic yield and complication rates with no established gold standard. Currently, the safest approach is bronchoscopic but it is limited by variable diagnostic yields. Percutaneous approaches are limited by nodule location and complications. With the recent advent of electromagnetic navigation (EMN), a combined bronchoscopic and transthoracic approach is now feasible in a single, staged procedure. Here, we present the study design and rationale for a single-arm trial evaluating a staged approach for the diagnosis of pulmonary nodules. Methods: Participants with 1–3 cm, intermediate to high-risk pulmonary nodules will undergo a staged approach with endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) followed by EMN-bronchoscopy (ENB), then EMN-transthoracic biopsy (EMN-TTNA) with the procedure terminated at any stage after a diagnosis is made via rapid onsite cytopathology. We aim to recruit 150 EMN participants from eight academic and community settings to show signiﬁcant improvements over other historic bronchoscopic guided techniques. The primary outcome is overall diagnostic yield of the staged approach. Conclusion: This is the ﬁrst study designed to evaluate the diagnostic yield of a staged procedure using EBUS, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cct.2018.06.007 Received 14 May 2018; Received in revised form 4 June 2018; Accepted 5 June 2018 ⁎ Corresponding author at: Johns Hopkins University Department of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, 1830 E Monument Street/5th Floor, Baltimore, MD","2018-08","2025-09-01 18:53:55","2025-09-01 18:53:56","2025-09-01 18:53:55","88-95","","","71","","Contemporary Clinical Trials","Study Design and Rationale","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/7YX3SUMX/Thiboutot et al. - 2018 - Study Design and Rationale A Multicenter, Prospective Trial of Electromagnetic Bronchoscopic and El.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods We compared the safety and efficacy of endobronchial-valve therapy in patients with heterogeneous emphysema versus standard medical care. Efficacy end points were percent changes in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and the 6-minute walk test on intention-to-treat analysis. We assessed safety on the basis of the rate of a composite of six major complications. Results Of 321 enrolled patients, 220 were randomly assigned to receive endobronchial valves (EBV group) and 101 to receive standard medical care (control group). At 6 months, there was an increase of 4.3% in the FEV1 in the EBV group (an increase of 1.0 percentage point in the percent of the predicted value), as compared with a decrease of 2.5% in the control group (a decrease of 0.9 percentage point in the percent of the predicted value). Thus, there was a mean between-group difference of 6.8% in the FEV1 (P = 0.005). Roughly similar between-group differences were observed for the 6-minute walk test. At 12 months, the rate of the complications composite was 10.3% in the EBV group versus 4.6% in the control group (P= 0.17). At 90 days, in the EBV group, as compared with the control group, there were increased rates of exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) requiring hospitalization (7.9% vs. 1.1%, P = 0.03) and hemoptysis (6.1% vs. 0%, P = 0.01). The rate of pneumonia in the target lobe in the EBV group was 4.2% at 12 months. Greater radiographic evidence of emphysema heterogeneity and fissure completeness was associated with an enhanced response to treatment. Conclusions Endobronchial-valve treatment for advanced heterogeneous emphysema induced modest improvements in lung function, exercise tolerance, and symptoms at the cost of more frequent exacerbations of COPD, pneumonia, and hemoptysis after implantation.

With chronic lower respiratory disease being the third leading cause of death in the US, this study sought to assess practice patterns and outcomes for LVRS on a national level since the NETT. Methods: Aggregate statistics on LVRS reported in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Database from January 2003 to June 2011 were analyzed to assess procedure volume, preoperative and operative characteristics, and outcomes. Comparisons to published data from the NETT were made using chi-squared and two sided t-tests. Results: In 8.5 years, 538 patients underwent LVRS, with 20 to 118 cases reported in the STS database per year. When compared to NETT subjects, STS patients were younger (p<0.001), a larger proportion underwent the procedure thoracoscopically (p<0.001), and FEV1 was 31% vs. 28% of predicted (p<0.001). When mortality was compared between STS patients and all NETT subjects randomized to surgery, there were no significant differences. However, mortality was 3% higher in STS patients when compared to the non-high risk NETT subset (p=0.005).

However, the potential impact of BLVR on survival is less understood. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the survival rate in patients who are evaluated for BLVR treatment and whether there is a difference in survival rate between patients who undergo BLVR treatment and patients who do not. Methods: We included patients with COPD who visited our hospital for a consultation evaluating their eligibility for BLVR treatment and who performed pulmonary function tests during this visit. Furthermore, vital status was verified. Results: In total 1471 patients were included (63% female, mean age 61 years). A total of 531 patients (35%) died during follow-up and the median survival time of the total population was 2694 days (95% confidence interval (CI) 2462–2926) which is approximately 7.4 years. The median survival time of patients who were treated with BLVR was significantly longer compared to patients who were not treated with BLVR (3133 days versus 2503 days, p < 0.001), and BLVR was found to be an independent predictor of survival when adjusting for other survival-influencing factors such as age, gender or severity of disease.

The many publications produced about EBUS-TBNA have led to a better understanding of the performance characteristics of this procedure. The goal of this document was to examine the current literature on the technical aspects of EBUS-TBNA as they relate to patient, technology, and proceduralist factors to provide evidence-based and expert guidance to clinicians. METHODS: Rigorous methodology has been applied to provide a trustworthy evidence-based guideline and expert panel report. A group of approved panelists developed key clinical questions by using the PICO (population, intervention, comparator, and outcome) format that addressed speciﬁc topics on the technical aspects of EBUS-TBNA. MEDLINE (via PubMed) and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched for relevant literature, which was supplemented by manual searches. References were screened for inclusion, and well-recognized document evaluation tools were used to assess the quality of included studies, to extract meaningful data, and to grade the level of evidence to support each recommendation or suggestion. RESULTS: Our systematic review and critical analysis of the literature on 15 PICO questions related to the technical aspects of EBUS-TBNA resulted in 12 statements: 7 evidence-based graded recommendations and 5 ungraded consensus-based statements. Three questions did not have sufﬁcient evidence to generate a statement. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence on the technical aspects of EBUS-TBNA varies in strength but is satisfactory in certain areas to guide clinicians on the best conditions to perform EBUSguided tissue sampling. Additional research is needed to enhance our knowledge regarding the optimal performance of this effective procedure.

By the time of diagnosis, most cases are at an advanced stage and about 30% present with symptoms caused by central endobronchial obstruction. Endobronchial cryosurgery is an eﬀective technique, which can be used to relieve tracheobronchial obstruction caused by lung cancer. This report describes the technique, using a nitrous oxide cooled cryoprobe, inserted through a bronchoscope, to remove the obstruction and reopen the airway. In this study, 476 consecutive patients (mean age 68.3 years, M:F ratio 1.9:1) with obstructive tracheobronchial tumours underwent a mean of 2.4 cryosurgical treatments. Their TNM staging was, stage II 6.7%, IIIa 21.0%, IIIb 23.9%, IV 48.4%. Improvement in symptom quantiﬁcation was found with 76.4, 69.0, 59.2, and 42.6% of symptomatic patients for haemoptysis, cough, dyspnoea, and chest pain, respectively. Mean values for respiratory function improved from 1.38 to 1.41 litres for FEV1 and 1.91 to 2.04 litres for FVC (p 6 0:0001). Mean performance status improved from 59.6 to 75.2 for Karnofsky scale and 3.04 to 2.20 for the WHO scale and the complication rate was 3.5% of treatments. The Kaplan–Meier median survival was 8.2 months and 1- and 2-year survival 38.4 and 15.9%, respectively. Survival analysis suggested a possible survival advantage over alternative palliative techniques. Endobronchial cryosurgery provides a safe and eﬀective method for the palliation of otherwise inoperable lung cancer. It has advantages over other methods in terms of safety, cost, and a low complication rate. Cryosurgery can be repeated as often as required.","2004-02","2025-09-01 18:54:16","2025-09-01 18:54:16","2025-09-01 18:54:16","55-61","","1","48","","Cryobiology","","","","","","","","en","https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/SRCYEJEF/Maiwand et al. - 2004 - The application of cryosurgery in the treatment of lung cancer.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence, any attempt to enhance diagnosis is worthwhile. We present a clinical pathway to guide combined application of interventional pulmonology (IP) for tracing causes of undiagnosed PEs. Subjects with undiagnosed PEs were identified in the Hospital Information System of Dalian Municipal Central Hospital from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2018. Eligible subjects were divided into a group of combined tests and a group of medical thoracoscopy (MT). Optimal and subsequent diagnostic tests were performed depending on the guidance of the clinical pathway by matching profitable chest lesions with the respective adaptation. As the guidance of clinical pathway, common bronchoscopy would be preferentially selected if pulmonary lesions involved or within the central bronchus, EBUS-TBNA was favoured when pulmonary lesions were adjacent to the central bronchus or with the enlarged mediastinal/hilar lymph nodes, guided bronchoscopy would be preferred if pulmonary nodules/masses were larger than 20 mm with discernible bronchus signs, CT-assisted transthoracic core biopsy was preferred if pulmonary nodules were less than 20 mm, image guided cutting needle biopsy was the recommendation if the pleural thickness was larger than 10 mm and pulmonary lesions were miliary. MT was preferred only when undiagnosed PEs was the initial symptom and pulmonary lesions were miliary or absent. A total of 83.57% cases of undiagnosed PEs were eligible for the clinical pathway, and 659 and 216 subjects were included in the combined tests and MT groups, respectively, depending on the optimal recommendation of the clinical pathway. The total diagnostic yields in the combined tests and MT groups were 95.99% and 91.20%, respectively, and the difference in total diagnostic yield was statistically significant (χ               2                = 7.510,               p                = 0.006). Overall, clinical pathway guidance of the combined application of IP is useful for tracing the causes of undiagnosed PEs. The diagnostic yield of undiagnosed PEs is significantly increased compared with that of MT alone.","2022-07-01","2025-09-01 18:54:28","2025-09-01 18:54:28","2025-09-01 18:54:28","11126","","1","12","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/P6EMD7XE/Liu et al. - 2022 - The efficiency of a clinical pathway to guide combined applications of interventional pulmonology in.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This trial investigated whether gravity drainage could protect against negative pressure-related complications such as chest discomfort, re-expansion pulmonary edema, or pneumothorax compared with active aspiration. METHODS: This prospective, multicenter, single-blind, randomized controlled trial allocated patients with large free-ﬂowing effusions estimated $ 500 mL 1:1 to undergo active aspiration or gravity drainage. Patients rated chest discomfort on 100-mm visual analog scales prior to, during, and following drainage. Thoracentesis was halted at complete evacuation or for persistent chest discomfort, intractable cough, or other complication. The primary outcome was overall procedural chest discomfort scored 5 min following the procedure. Secondary outcomes included measures of discomfort and breathlessness through 48 h postprocedure. RESULTS: A total of 142 patients were randomized to undergo treatment, with 140 in the ﬁnal analysis. Groups did not differ for the primary outcome (mean visual analog scale score difference, 5.3 mm; 95% CI, –2.4 to 13.0; P ¼ .17). Secondary outcomes of discomfort and dyspnea did not differ between groups. Comparable volumes were drained in both groups, but the procedure duration was signiﬁcantly longer in the gravity arm (mean difference, 7.4 min; 95% CI, 10.2 to 4.6; P < .001). There were no serious complications. CONCLUSIONS: Thoracentesis via active aspiration and gravity drainage are both safe and result in comparable levels of procedural comfort and dyspnea improvement.

Methods: A total of 405 patients with pleural infection were prospectively enrolled into a multicenter study investigating the utility of ﬁbrinolytic therapy. The combined frequency of death and surgery, and secondary outcomes (hospital stay, change in chest radiograph, and lung function at 3 months) were compared in patients receiving chest tubes of differing size (x2, t test, and logistic regression analyses as appropriate). Pain was studied in detail in 128 patients.

The primary outcome was chest tube reinsertion within 24 hours due to recurrent ipsilateral pneumothorax. Results: 92 patients were randomized, of whom 83 were included in the per-protocol analysis. The majority of cases were post-operative after pulmonary resection surgery. Chest tube reinsertion within 24 hours occurred in 0 of 44 Clamping Group patients (0.0%) and in 1 of 39 No-Clamping Group patients (2.6%) (risk difference, 2.6 percentage points; 95% CI, −2.4 to 7.5), meeting the non-inferiority margin.

Methods: We studied the various EBUS ultrasonographic lymph node characteristics (size, shape, margins, heterogeneous echotexture, calciﬁcation, central hilar structure, lymph node conglomeration, central intranodal vessel, and coagulation necrosis sign) from our available EBUS-TBNA database. Results: We extracted 1086 subjects [547 with tuberculosis (TB) and 539 with malignant diagnosis]. Comparing the 2 groups (multivariate analysis), presence of central hilar structure (8.2% vs. 2.6%), coagulation necrosis sign (37.5% vs. 13.7%), lymph node conglomeration (30.5% vs. 7.2%), calciﬁcation (5.1% vs. 1.5%), and distinct margins (83.5% vs. 69.8%), were signiﬁcantly more common in TB (P < 0.05).

However, it is unknown whether the technique of TPC placement inﬂuences pleurodesis outcomes. Methods: This is a retrospective, single-center study of patients who underwent TPC placement from 2010 through 2018. Pleurodesis success was deﬁned as TPC removal within 90 days of placement in the setting of no further drainage and in the absence of catheter malfunction, infection, patient’s choice for another treatment modality, or other catheter-related complications. Pleurodesis failure was deﬁned as patients who did not have TPC removal within 90 days of insertion. Results: A total of 326 patients underwent TPC insertion by thoracic surgery, interventional pulmonology, or interventional radiology. Fourteen patients were excluded due to insufﬁcient follow-up. Of the 312 patients included in the ﬁnal analysis, 32.7% achieved pleurodesis. Patients who had their TPC inserted thoracoscopically achieved higher pleurodesis success compared with a percutaneous technique (61.2% vs 24.9%, P < 0.001). Thoracoscopically placed catheters had two times greater chance of removal than those inserted percutaneously (hazard ratio: 2.04, 95% CI: 1.14-3.64, P = 0.02) after controlling for pleural biopsies and sclerosing agents used during thoracoscopy.

METHODS: This was a multicenter registry study of patients undergoing therapeutic bronchoscopy for malignant central airway obstruction. The primary outcome was technical success, defined as reopening the airway lumen to . 50% of normal. Secondary outcomes were dyspnea as measured by the Borg score and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) as measured by the SF-6D. RESULTS: Fifteen centers performed 1,115 procedures on 947 patients. Technical success was achieved in 93% of procedures. Center success rates ranged from 90% to 98% (P 5 .02). Endobronchial obstruction and stent placement were associated with success, whereas American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score . 3, renal failure, primary lung cancer, left mainstem disease, and tracheoesophageal fistula were associated with failure. Clinically significant improvements in dyspnea occurred in 90 of 187 patients measured (48%). Greater baseline dyspnea was associated with greater improvements in dyspnea, whereas smoking, having multiple cancers, and lobar obstruction were associated with smaller improvements. Clinically significant improvements in HRQOL occurred in 76 of 183 patients measured (42%). Greater baseline dyspnea was associated with greater improvements in HRQOL, and lobar obstruction was associated with smaller improvements. CONCLUSIONS: Technical success rates were high overall, with the highest success rates associated with stent placement and endobronchial obstruction. Therapeutic bronchoscopy should not be withheld from patients based solely on an assessment of risk, since patients with the most dyspnea and lowest functional status benefitted the most.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This open-label, randomized clinical trial included participants recruited from 9 centers in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, and Hong Kong between July 2012 and October 2014; they were followed up for 12 months (study end date: October 16, 2015). Patients (n = 146) with symptomatic malignant pleural effusion who had not undergone indwelling pleural catheter or pleurodesis treatment were included. INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomized (1:1) to indwelling pleural catheter (n = 74) or talc pleurodesis (n = 72), minimized by malignancy (mesothelioma vs others) and trapped lung (vs not), and stratified by region (Australia vs Asia). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was the total number of days spent in hospital from procedure to death or to 12 months. Secondary outcomes included further pleural interventions, patient-reported breathlessness, quality-of-life measures, and adverse events. RESULTS Among 146 randomized patients (median age, 70.5 years; 56.2% male), 2 were excluded. The indwelling pleural catheter group spent significantly fewer days in hospital than the pleurodesis group. The reduction was mainly in effusion-related hospitalization days. Fewer patients randomized to indwelling pleural catheter required further ipsilateral invasive pleural drainages.

The goal of this analysis was to examine the literature on TBC as it relates to diagnostic utility and safety to provide evidence-based and expert guidance to clinicians. METHODS: Approved panelists developed key questions regarding the diagnostic utility and safety of TBC for the evaluation of ILD using the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcome) format. MEDLINE (via PubMed) and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched for relevant literature, which was supplemented by manual searches. References were screened for inclusion, and vetted evaluation tools were used to assess the quality of included studies, to extract data, and to grade the level of evidence supporting each recommendation or statement. Graded recommendations and ungraded consensus-based statements were drafted and voted on using a modiﬁed Delphi technique to achieve consensus. RESULTS: The systematic review and critical analysis of the literature based on four PICO questions resulted in six statements: two evidence-based graded recommendations and four ungraded consensus-based statements. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of the utility and safety of TBC for the diagnosis of ILD is limited but suggests TBC is safer than SLB, and its contribution to the diagnosis obtained via multidisciplinary discussion is comparable to that of SLB, although the histological diagnostic yield appears higher with SLB (approximately 80% for TBC vs 95% for SLB). Additional research is needed to enhance knowledge regarding utility and safety of TBC, its role in the diagnostic algorithm of ILD, and the impact of technical aspects of the procedure on diagnostic yield and safety.

NAVABLATE characterized the safety and performance of transbronchial microwave ablation (MWA) in the lung. Methods: The prospective, single-arm, 2-center NAVABLATE study (NCT03569111) evaluated transbronchial MWA in patients with histologically conﬁrmed lung malignancies ≤ 30 mm in maximum diameter who were not candidates for, or who declined, both surgery and stereotactic body radiation therapy. Ablation of 1 nodule was allowed per subject. The nodule was reached with electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy. Conebeam computed tomography was used to verify the ablation catheter position and to evaluate the ablation zone postprocedure. The primary end point was composite adverse events related to the transbronchial MWA device through 1-month follow-up. Secondary end points included technical success (nodule reached and ablated according to the study protocol) and technique efﬁcacy (satisfactory ablation based on 1-month follow-up imaging). Results: Thirty subjects (30 nodules; 66.7% primary lung, 33.3% oligometastatic) were enrolled from February 2019 to September 2020. The pre-procedure median nodule size was 12.5 mm (range 5 to 27 mm). Procedureday technical success was 100% (30/30), with a mean ablative margin of 9.9 ± 2.7 mm. One-month imaging showed 100% (30/30) technique efﬁcacy. The composite adverse event rate related to the transbronchial MWA device through 1-month follow-up was 3.3% (1 subject, mild hemoptysis). No deaths or pneumothoraces occurred. Four subjects (13.3%) experienced grade 3 complications; none had grade 4 or 5.

Because of their potentially inﬁltrative nature, surgical resection remains the treatment of choice. However, not all patients with technically resectable disease will be able to undergo surgery, primarily because of poor lung function or medical co-morbidities. Centrally located, intraluminal tumors have been reported to be amenable to bronchoscopic treatment. We speciﬁcally examined the role of cryotherapy in the treatment of bronchial carcinoid tumors. Methods: Sixty-three patients (52.38% female) who underwent a combined total of 243 cryotherapy procedures for treatment of bronchial carcinoid between 1992 and 2020 in our institution were included in the study. Following discussion in multidisciplinary meetings, patients were considered for ﬁrst-line cryotherapy when lung resection was deemed not possible or when they had rejected surgery. Results: Cryotherapy resulted in complete remission in 21 (33.33%) patients with maximum tumor diameter less than 20 mm (mean: 11.08 mm, 95% conﬁdence interval: 8.76-13.40), and allowed 22 (34.92%) patients with larger lesions (mean: 24.04 mm, 95% conﬁdence interval: 18.78-29.30) to proceed with parenchymal sparing resections. Marked symptomatic relief (P < 0.001) was reported by 58 (92.06%) patients. The median follow-up was 33 months (range: 0 to 243 mo). One (1.59%) patient was diagnosed with recurrence in a contralateral lobe 3 years after surgery and was treated with radiofrequency ablation. Conclusions: In the absence of a deﬁnitive randomized controlled trial comparing bronchoscopic treatment with surgical resection, we provide evidence on the safety and efﬁcacy of cryotherapy and encourage wider adoption of this inexpensive and minimally invasive technique for treatment of bronchial carcinoids.","2022-01","2025-09-01 18:55:18","2025-09-01 18:55:18","2025-09-01 18:55:18","71-82","","1","29","","","Treatment of Pulmonary Carcinoid Tumors With Bronchoscopic Cryotherapy","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/6M8LLZF3/Perikleous et al. - 2022 - Treatment of Pulmonary Carcinoid Tumors With Bronchoscopic Cryotherapy A 28-Year Single-center Expe.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is usually performed with bronchoscopy guidance. Ultrasound has emerged as a useful tool in order to assist PDT, potentially improving its success rate and reducing procedural-related complications. Objective: To investigate whether the ultrasound-guided PDT is equivalent or superior to the bronchoscopy-guided or anatomical landmarks–guided PDT with regard to procedural-related and clinical complications. Methods: A systematic review of randomized clinical trials was conducted comparing an ultrasound-guided PDT to the control groups (either a bronchoscopy-guided PDT or an anatomical landmark–guided PDT) in patients undergoing a PDT in the ICU. The primary outcome was the incidence of major procedural-related and clinical complication rates. The secondary outcome was the incidence of minor complication rates. Random-effect meta-analyzes were used to pool the results. Results: Four studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and they were analyzed. The studies included 588 participants. There were no differences in the major complication rates between the patients who were assigned to the ultrasound-guided PDT when compared to the control groups (pooled risk ratio [RR]: 0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.131.71, I2 ¼ 0%). The minor complication rates were not different between the groups, but they had a high heterogeneity (pooled RR: 0.49; 95% CI 0.16-1.50; I2 ¼ 85%). The sensitivity analyzes that only included the randomized controlled trials that used a landmark-guided PDT as the control group showed lower rates of minor complications in the ultrasound-guided PDT group (pooled RR: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.31-0.98, I2 ¼ 0%). Conclusion: The ultrasound-guided PDT seems to be safe and it is comparable to the bronchoscopy-guided PDT regarding the major and minor procedural-related or clinical complications. It also seems to reduce the minor complications when compared to the anatomical landmark–guided PDT.","2020-05","2025-09-01 18:55:20","2025-09-01 18:55:20","2025-09-01 18:55:20","445-452","","5","35","","J Intensive Care Med","Ultrasound-Guided Percutaneous Dilational Tracheostomy","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/SDZLQDF6/Gobatto et al. - 2020 - Ultrasound-Guided Percutaneous Dilational Tracheostomy A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, evidence for its utility in the diagnostic workup of silicosis is limited. Methods: This single-center retrospective study included patients with occupational silica exposure who underwent EBUS-TBNA to evaluate MHL on computed tomography (CT). Cytology specimens were re-examined by an independent pathologist under polarized microscopy, and cytologic criteria for the diagnosis of LN silicosis were formulated from the ﬁndings. Primary outcomes were the determination of the diagnostic yield (DY) of EBUS-TBNA for LN silicosis and the assessment of its sensitivity for the diagnosis of parenchymal silicosis in patients with known chronic silicosis. Results: Eighty-four patients with silica exposure underwent EBUSTBNA to evaluate MHL. This population is predominantly coal miners, 77 (91%). Birefringent silica particles (BSP) were identiﬁed in 82 (97.62%), silicotic nodules (SN) in 26 (30.95%), and granulomas in 21 (25%). EBUS-TBNA demonstrated a DY of 95.2% for LN silicosis, and supported the diagnosis of parenchymal silicosis with a sensitivity of 97.6%. Conclusion: EBUS-TBNA effectively identiﬁes LN silicosis and conﬁrms the diagnosis of parenchymal silicosis in the appropriate clinical-radiologic context. Granulomas can be seen in cytologic specimens of patients with silicosis. In patients with well-deﬁned silica exposure and suspected silicosis, EBUS-TBNA does not impact the preprocedural presumed diagnosis of silicosis. Therefore, EBUS-TBNA should be reserved for cases in which alternative diagnoses are more likely.","2025-07","2025-09-01 18:55:31","2025-09-01 18:55:31","2025-09-01 18:55:31","","","3","32","","","Utility of EBUS-TBNA in Evaluating Mediastinal and Hilar Lymphadenopathy in Patients With Silica Exposure","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/ESX3I6X3/Aljarod et al. - 2025 - Utility of EBUS-TBNA in Evaluating Mediastinal and Hilar Lymphadenopathy in Patients With Silica Exp.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Studies have evaluated elastography for differentiating malignant from benign lymph nodes during endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration. Several methods of performing elastography are described with variable diagnostic accuracy. Methods: The aim of this study was to evaluate endobronchial ultrasound-guided elastography in differentiating malignant from benign mediastinal lymphadenopathy. We performed a systematic search of the PubMed and Embase databases to extract the relevant studies. A diagnostic accuracy meta-analysis was carried out to calculate the pooled sensitivity and speciﬁcity [with 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs)], and positive and negative likelihood ratios of elastography. Results: After a systematic search, 20 studies (1600 patients, 2712 nodes) were selected. The pooled sensitivity and speciﬁcity of elastography were 0.90 (95% CI, 0.84-0.94) and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.73-0.84), respectively. The summary receiver operating curve demonstrated an area under the curve for elastography of 0.90 (0.88-0.93). The positive and negative likelihood ratios and the diagnostic odds ratio were 4.3 (95% CI, 3.3-5.5), 0.12 (95% CI, 0.07-0.20), and 35 (95% CI, 19-63), respectively. Of the most commonly described methods, the color classiﬁcation method (type 3 malignant vs. type 1 benign) demonstrated the highest area under the curve of 0.91 (0.88-0.93). There was signiﬁcant heterogeneity and publication bias. Subgroup analyses indicated no signiﬁcant difference between the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of quantitative and qualitative elastography methods.

A novel bronchoscopic therapy, targeted lung denervation (TLD), which disrupts parasympathetic pulmonary innervation of the lung, has been developed to reduce clinical consequences of cholinergic hyperactivity and its impact on COPD exacerbations. The AIRFLOW-2 study assessed the durability of safety and efficacy of TLD additive to optimal drug therapy compared to sham bronchoscopy and optimal drug therapy alone in subjects with moderate-to-severe, symptomatic COPD two years post randomization. Patients and Methods: TLD was performed in COPD patients (FEV1 30–60% predicted, CAT≥10 or mMRC≥2) in a 1:1 randomized, sham-controlled, double-blinded multicenter study (AIRFLOW-2) using a novel lung denervation system (Nuvaira, Inc., USA). Subjects remained blinded until their 12.5-month follow-up visit when control subjects were offered the opportunity to undergo TLD. A time-to-first-event analysis on moderate and severe and severe exacerbations of COPD was performed. Results: Eighty-two subjects (FEV1 41.6±7.4% predicted, 50.0% male, age 63.7±6.8 yrs, 24% with prior year respiratory hospitalization) were randomized. Time-to-first severe COPD exacerbation was significantly lengthened in the TLD arm (p=0.04, HR=0.38) at 2 years post-TLD therapy and trended towards similar attenuation for moderate and severe COPD exacerbations (p=0.18, HR=0.71). No significant changes in lung function or SGRQC were found 2 years post randomization between groups. Conclusion: In a randomized trial, TLD demonstrated a durable effect of significantly lower risk of severe AECOPD over 2 years. Further, lung function and quality of life remained stable following TLD.","2020-11","2025-09-01 18:55:40","2025-09-01 18:55:40","2025-09-01 18:55:40","2807-2816","","","Volume 15","","COPD","Two-Year Outcomes for the Double-Blind, Randomized, Sham-Controlled Study of Targeted Lung Denervation in Patients with Moderate to Severe COPD","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/BHPEWQ7S/Valipour et al. - 2020 - Two-Year Outcomes for the Double-Blind, Randomized, Sham-Controlled Study of Targeted Lung Denervati.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Materials and Methods: This single-center, randomized trial (2012–2016) enrolled 122 patients referred for image-guided PG; all enrolled patients completed the study. Of enrolled patients, 68 were randomly assigned to receive either antibiotics (n ¼ 34) or placebo (n ¼ 34) before PG placement. The remaining 54 patients were taking pre-existing antibiotics and were assigned to an observation arm.

The primary outcome was peristomal infection. Results: Under intention-to-treat analysis, early infection rate was 11.8% (4/34 patients; 95% CI, 0.0%–9.4%) in the placebo arm and 0.0% (0/34 patients; 95% CI, 0.0%–8.4%) in the antibiotic arm (P ¼.057 for comparison of infections in the 2 arms).

Both navigational bronchoscopy and computed tomography–guided transthoracic needle biopsy are commonly used in patients undergoing biopsies of peripheral pulmonary nodules, but the relative diagnostic accuracy of these two approaches is unclear. METHODS In this multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, noninferiority trial, we assigned patients with an intermediate-risk or high-risk peripheral pulmonary nodule measuring 10 to 30 mm in diameter to undergo navigational bronchoscopy or transthoracic needle biopsy at seven centers across the United States. The primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy, which was defined as the percentage of patients with biopsies that showed a specific diagnosis (cancer or a specific benign condition) that was confirmed to be accurate through 12 months of clinical follow-up (nonferiority margin, 10 percentage points). Secondary outcomes included procedural complications such as the occurrence of pneumothorax. RESULTS Among the 234 patients included in the primary-outcome analysis (5 of whom were lost to follow-up), biopsy resulted in a specific diagnosis that was confirmed to be accurate through month 12 in 94 of 119 patients (79.0%) in the navigational bronchoscopy group and in 81 of 110 patients (73.6%) in the transthoracic needle biopsy group (absolute difference, 5.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, −6.5 to 17.2; P=0.003 for noninferiority; P=0.17 for superiority). Pneumothorax occurred in 4 of 121 patients (3.3%) in the navigational bronchoscopy group and in 32 of 113 patients (28.3%) in the transthoracic needle biopsy group and led to the placement of a chest tube, hospital admission, or both in 1 patient (0.8%) and 13 patients (11.5%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS The diagnostic accuracy of navigational bronchoscopy was noninferior to that of transthoracic needle biopsy among patients with peripheral pulmonary nodules measuring 10 to 30 mm.

The study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of navigation bronchoscopy-guided water-cooled microwave ablation catheter for nonsurgical peripheral lung cancer. Methods: This was a prospective single arm pilot study. Patients with early stage or multiple primary peripheral lung cancer who were nonsurgical candidates for surgery were enrolled in the study. Bronchoscopic microwave ablation was performed via a flexible water-cooled microwave ablation antenna under the guidance of navigation bronchoscopy. Radial probe endobronchial ultrasound combined with fluoroscopy was used to confirm the position. Treatment outcomes were evaluated based on follow-up chest CT and positron emission tomography scans. Primary endpoints were technical success and safety. Secondary endpoints were complete ablation rate, 2-year local control rate, and progression-free survival. Results: Thirteen patients were enrolled in the study from April 2018 to July 2019. A total of 19 sessions of microwave ablation were performed on 14 tumors under the guidance of navigation bronchoscopy. The technical success was 100%. Treatmentrelated complications occurred in two patients. The complete ablation rate was 78.6% (11/14). The 2-year local control rate was 71.4%. Median progression-free survival was 33 months for all patients. Conclusions: In this pilot study, bronchoscopic microwave ablation appears to be feasible with acceptable occurrence of complication in the treatment of peripheral lung cancer under the guidance of navigation bronchoscopy.","2022-04","2025-09-01 18:55:52","2025-09-01 18:55:52","2025-09-01 18:55:52","1014-1020","","7","13","","Thoracic Cancer","Microwave ablation via a flexible catheter for the treatment of nonsurgical peripheral lung cancer","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/QYP3Q6BU/Xie et al. - 2022 - Microwave ablation via a flexible catheter for the treatment of nonsurgical peripheral lung cancer.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Percutaneous gastrostomy is a less-invasive approach than open surgical gastrostomy, and can be accomplished via endoscopy (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy or PEG) or sonographic or fluoroscopic guidance (percutaneous radiological gastrostomy or PRG). Both techniques have diﬀerent limitations, advantages, and contraindications.

The gold standard therapy for PAP is whole lung lavage (WLL). Few studies have reported the optimal technique with which to evaluate the response to WLL. In this study, we aimed to identify parameters with which to assess the need for repeat WLL during a long‑term 8‑year follow‑up. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 120 patients with autoimmune PAP with 80 of whom underwent WLL. Physiologic, serologic, and radiologic features of the patients were analyzed during an 8‑year follow‑up after the first WLL treatment. Results: Of the 40 patients without any intervention, 39 patients either achieved remission or remained stable and only one died of pulmonary infection. Of the 56 patients who underwent WLL for 1 time, 55 remained free from a second WLL and 1 patient died of cancer. Twenty‑four required additional treatments after their first WLL. The baseline PaO2 (P = 0.000), PA‑aO2 (P = 0.000), shunt fraction rate (P = 0.001), percent of predicted normal diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO%Pred) (P = 0.016), 6‑min walk test (P = 0.013), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (P = 0.007), and neuron‑specific enolase (NSE) (P = 0.003) showed significant differences among the three groups. The need for a second WLL was significantly associated with PaO2 (P = 0.000), CEA(P = 0.050) , the 6‑minute walk test (P = 0.026), and DLCO%Pred (P = 0.041). The DLCO%Pred on admission with a cut‑off value of 42.1% (P = 0.001) may help to distinguish whether patients with PAP require a second WLL. Conclusions: WLL is the optimal treatment method for PAP and provides remarkable improvements for affected patients. The DLCO%Pred on admission with a cut‑off value of 42.1% may distinguish whether patients with PAP require a second WLL.","2015","2025-09-01 18:55:55","2025-09-01 18:55:55","","","","20","128","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/russellmiller/Zotero/storage/E6R56VIJ/Zhao et al. - 2015 - Whole Lung Lavage Treatment of Chinese Patients with Autoimmune Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis A Re.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
