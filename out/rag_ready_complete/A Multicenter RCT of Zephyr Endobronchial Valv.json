Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Zephyr EBV in heterogeneous emphysema with little to no collateral ventilation in the treated lobe. Methods: Subjects were enrolled with a 2:1 randomization (EBV/standard of care [SoC]) at 24 sites. Primary outcome at 12 months was the D EBV -SoC of subjects with a post-bronchodilator FEV1 improvement from baseline of greater than or equal to 15%. Secondary endpoints included absolute changes in postbronchodilator FEV1, 6-minute-walk distance, and St. George ' s Respiratory Questionnaire scores. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 190 subjects (128 EBV and 62 SoC) were randomized. At 12 months, 47.7% EBV and 16.8% SoC subjects had a D FEV1 greater than or equal to 15% ( P , 0.001). D EBV -SoC at 12 months was statistically and clinically signi /uniFB01 cant: for FEV1, 0.106 L ( P , 0.001); 6-minute-walk distance, 1 39.31 m ( P = 0.002); and St. George ' s Respiratory Questionnaire, 2 7.05 points ( P = 0.004). Signi /uniFB01 cant D EBV -SoC were also observed in hyperin /uniFB02 ation (residual volume, 2 522 ml; P , 0.001), modi /uniFB01 ed Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale ( 2 0.8 points; P , 0.001), and the BODE (body mass index, air /uniFB02 ow obstruction, dyspnea, and exercise capacity) index ( 2 1.2 points). Pneumothorax was the most commonserious adverse event in the treatment period (procedure to 45 d), in 34/128 (26.6%) of EBV subjects. Four deaths occurred in the EBV group during this phase, and one each in the EBV and SoC groups between 46 days and 12 months. Conclusions: Zephyr EBV provides clinically meaningful bene /uniFB01 ts in lung function, exercise tolerance, dyspnea, and quality of life out to at least 12 months, with an acceptable safety pro /uniFB01 le in patients with little or no collateral ventilation in the target lobe.

Patients with advanced emphysema, one of the diseases that comprises Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), are characterized by hyperin /uniFB02 ation that precipitates breathlessness and predisposes\nindividuals to exacerbations and has a greater negative impact on health status than self-reported cardiovascular disease and diabetes (2, 3).\nMany surgical procedures have been devised to treat this disease including costochondrectomy, phrenic crush, pneumoperitoneum, pleural abrasion, surgical lung denervation, and thoracoplasty. But apart from lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS), bullectomy, and lung transplantation all others have not proven to be viable (4). LVRS has been extensively studied, and in appropriately selected patients reduces hyperin /uniFB02 ation improving lung function, dyspnea, exercise tolerance, and long-term survival (5 -7). However, LVRS is underused because of concerns about the invasiveness of the procedure, increased associated perioperative morbidity and mortality, and narrow patient eligibility criteria (8 -10). Zephyr Endobronchial Valves (Zephyr EBV, Pulmonx Corporation) are small duckbill valves inserted bronchoscopically into the lung to occlude an emphysematous lobe. Lobar de /uniFB02 ation from the EBV leads to partial or full lobar atelectasis, thus reducing hyperin /uniFB02 ation and mimicking the mechanisms of LVRS.\nIn the /uniFB01 rst randomized controlled trial of Zephyr EBV, VENT (Endobronchial Valve for Emphysema Palliation Trial), the coprimary endpoints of FEV1 and 6-minute-walk distance (6MWD) achieved statistical but not clinically meaningful improvements between groups (11). Post hoc analysis showed that only patients with complete /uniFB01 ssures in the treated lung and in whom lobar occlusion (occlusive positioning of valves in all segmental and subsegmental airways feeding the\ntarget lobe) was achieved had clinically meaningful outcomes (12, 13).\nAfter VENT, subsequent short-term studies with Zephyr EBV have shown that by selecting patients with little to no collateral ventilation between target and ipsilateral lobes and performing post-procedure con /uniFB01 rmation of lobar occlusion, similar bene /uniFB01 ts to LVRS can be achieved in patients with heterogeneous or homogeneous emphysema (14 -17) but with less morbidity. All these studies included a control arm and followed subjects out to 3 or 6 months.\nLIBERATE (Pulmonx Endobronchial Valves Used in Treatment of Emphysema) is the /uniFB01 rst large randomized controlled multicenter international study conducted in patients with severe heterogeneous emphysema and with little to no collateral ventilation in the target lung to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and durability of bene /uniFB01 t out to 12 months. The study compared Zephyr EBV treatment with standard medical management to standard medical management alone.\nSome of the results have been previously reported in the form of an abstract (18).",

      "content": "Field: This multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial of the Zephyr Endobronchial Valve treatment in patients with heterogeneous emphysema distribution and little to no collateral ventilation demonstrates signi /uniFB01 cant clinically meaningful bene /uniFB01 ts over current standard of care medical therapy in lung function, dyspnea, exercise capacity, and quality of life out to at least 12 months after the procedure.\nprovided written informed consent. The consent informed all subjects that their /uniFB01 nal enrollment in the study would be determined after the bronchoscopy procedure for collateral ventilation assessment with the Chartis Pulmonary Assessment System (510K Cleared K111764; Pulmonx Corporation).\nThe sample size was estimated using the results from the VENT trial (U.S. and European cohorts) (11, 12). Based on the results of these studies, the responder rate (FEV1 improvement of > 15%) in the Zephyr EBV treatment group was expected to be approximately 35% at 1 year. The responder rate for the control group was not expected to exceed 10% at 1 year. Assuming a two-sided 0.05 a level, study power of 90%, and 2:1 allocation random assignment, a sample size of 147 was expected to be adequate to test for superiority. The study sample size was increased to 183 to allow for 20% lost to follow-up and incomplete data. Each study site was allowed to enroll a maximum of 25 study participants.\nEligible emphysema patients were exsmokers between 40 and 75 years of age, with post-bronchodilator (BD) FEV1 between 15% and 45% predicted, TLC greater than 100% predicted, residual volume (RV) greater than or equal to 175% predicted, DL CO greater than or equal to 20% predicted, and a 6MWD between 100 and 500 m after a supervised pulmonary rehabilitation program (complete inclusion and exclusion criteria provided in Section E1 in the online supplement). Target lobe selection was based on a greater than 50% destruction score (percentage of voxels less than 2 910 Houns /uniFB01 eld units on computed tomography [CT]) and heterogeneous emphysema de /uniFB01 ned as absolute difference of 15 or greater in destruction scores between the targeted and ipsilateral lobes determined by investigational sites using Myrian quantitative software (Intrasense; see Figure E1).\nEligible patients were assessed with the Chartis to determine collateral ventilation status between targeted and adjacent lobes before randomization (19) (additional details provided in Section E2). Figure E2 shows examples of ' collateral ventilation negative ' and ' collateral ventilation positive ' assessments on Chartis. Subjects deemed to have a ' collateral ventilation negative ' target lobe by Chartis were randomized in a 2:1 fashion (blocked\ndesign) immediately after the Chartis assessment to either the EBV or standardof-care (SoC) groups ( see Section E3). The bronchoscopy procedure for subjects randomized to SoC was terminated after the Chartis assessment and subjects recovered per institutional clinical practice. Subjects randomized to EBV underwent placement of Zephyr EBV valves during the same session with the intent to achieve complete lobar occlusion (20). Subjects assessed as ' collateral ventilation positive ' were exited from the study ( see Section E2 for complete details).\nSubjects randomized to SoC were discharged after post-bronchoscopy recovery. Subjects randomized to EBV were hospitalized for 5 nights regardless of clinical status and underwent daily chest radiographs (with the /uniFB01 rst taken within an hour of the bronchoscopy procedure) until discharge ( see Figure E3 for postrandomization follow-up of study subjects). Frequency of chest radiographs for any hospitalization for an adverse event was at the discretion of the physician, but a chest radiograph was required on the day of discharge. Clinical staff was trained regarding the risk of a pneumothorax; equipment needed to treat a pneumothorax was kept bedside. At discharge, subjects were provided a wrist-band denoting ' patient at risk of pneumothorax ' and were instructed to seek immediate medical attention in the event of symptoms of a potential pneumothorax.\nEBV subjects were contacted daily by telephone for 10 days after discharge; and evaluated during site visits at Day 7, Day 30, and Day 45 after discharge. At 45 days, a high-resolution CT scan was performed and assessed by an Independent Core Lab (MedQIA) to determine target lobe volume reduction (TLVR), and to verify whether complete lobar occlusion had been achieved. If necessary (TLVR , 50%, and incomplete lobar occlusion), a repeat bronchoscopy and valve revision/replacement was recommended. All subjects had clinical visits at 45 days and 3, 6 , 9, and 12 months after bronchoscopy. To reduce variability in the collection of the spirometry data, all study sites used the ERT MasterScope (eResearch Technology), a central diagnostic station attached to a spirometer to capture the FEV1 and FVC measurements ( see Section E4). EBV-treated subjects are planned for annual follow-up for an additional 4 years. After the 12-month\nevaluation, if eligible, SoC group subjects were given the option to crossover to EBV treatment with planned follow-up for an additional 5 years.",

At 12 months after the procedure, 47.7% of the EBV subjects compared with 16.8% SoC subjects had a\ngreater than or equal to 15% increase over baseline in post-BD FEV1, with a betweengroup absolute difference of 31.0 (95% con /uniFB01 dence interval, 18.0 -43.9%; P , 0.001; intention-to-treat). The results of the primary effectiveness endpoint are shown graphically in Figure 2.\nSecondary outcomes. All three secondary endpoints improved in favor of EBVand met statistical signi /uniFB01 cance (Table 2 and Figure 3); the difference of means between EBV and SoC groups from baseline to 12 months for the absolute change in FEV1 was 0.106 L (17.96% for percent change in FEV1; P , 0.001) (Figure 3A), 6MWD was 39.3 m ( P = 0.002) (Figure 3B), and SGRQ was 2 7.05 points ( P = 0.004) (Figure 3C). Improvements in FEV1, 6MWD, and SGRQ score after EBV treatment were evident as early as 45 days after the procedure and persisted out to at least 12 months (Figure 4).\nThere were two measures at baseline that were imbalanced between the EBV and SoC groups at a two-sided 0.10 level, mMRC ( P = 0.091) and GOLD stage classi /uniFB01 cation based on the percent predicted FEV1 ( P =0.037); however, there was no imbalance between groups based on FEV1. The interaction terms from logistic regression or from analysis of covariance with factors of treatment group and baseline value for mMRC or GOLD stage classi /uniFB01 cation as covariate were not signi /uniFB01 cant for the primary endpoint ( P = 0.799 and P = 0.906 for mMRC and GOLD, respectively), or any of the secondary endpoints. Thus, neither of these variables had an impact on the primary or secondary effectiveness endpoints. The P value for the logistic regression with factors of treatment group, investigational site, and treatment group by investigational site interaction did not show any investigational site effect ( P = 0.785).\nA signi /uniFB01 cantly greater percentage of subjects in the EBV group than in the SoC group met Odds ratio (or) exceeded the MCID for FEV1 (change of > 15% and > 12%), SGRQ (change of <2 4 points), and 6MWD (change of > 25 m), indicating meaningful clinical bene /uniFB01 t was achieved (Figure 5; 6-mo responder data in Figure E4). Correspondingly, a higher percentage of subjects in the SoC group consistently either declined or had no change compared with the EBV group across these endpoints (Figure 6). Individual subject responses to each of these measures are presented graphically in Figure E5.\nAt 45 days after the procedure, 79.1% of subjects achieved a TLVR of greater than or equal to 350 ml, with a mean reduction of 1.03 6 0.68 L ( P , 0.001) and at 12 months, 84.2% of subjects achieved a TLVR of greater than or equal to 350 ml, with a mean reduction of 1.14 6 0.70 L ( P , 0.001) (Figure 5).\nConsistent with a durable TLVR at 12 months in the EBV group, there was a signi /uniFB01 cant reduction in hyperin /uniFB02 ation as measured by RV (decrease of 522 ml; P , 0.001; EBV -SoC) and RV/TLC ratio (decrease of 0.05; P , 0.001; EBV -SoC) (Table 2). At 12 months, RV decrease of 310 ml or more was achieved by 61.6% EBV subjects compared with 22.4% subjects in the SoC group (Figure 5). There was a signi /uniFB01 cant improvement in gas exchange in the EBV compared with SoC groups (increase in DL CO of 0.870 ml CO/min/mm Hg; P = 0.013; EBV -SoC). The mMRC dyspnea score improved in favor of EBV with a between-group change of 2 0.8 points ( P , 0.001) with a greater number of subjects in the EBV group (47.8%) than in the SOC group (18.6%) meeting Odds ratio (or) exceeding the MCID of 2 1 point change; P , 0.001).\nSubjects in the EBV group had a greater reduction from baseline in the\nmulticomponent composite BODE index than those in the SoC group, with a mean difference between groups of 2 1.2 points ( P , 0.001) at 12 months. More subjects in the EBV than in the SoC group were responders achieving a MCID change of 2 1 point Odds ratio (or) less (58.0% vs. 24.1%, respectively; P , 0.001) (Figure 6). Supplemental oxygen usage at 12 months in the EBV and SoC group subjects was evaluated to compare change in oxygen usage from baseline. A larger proportion of EBV subjects than SoC subjects (15.7% vs. 6.9%, respectively) used less oxygen, whereas a larger proportion of SoC subjects\nthan EBV subjects (22.4% vs. 11.3%, respectively) used more oxygen, at 12 months than their baseline usage; the distribution of oxygen change categories was statistically signi /uniFB01 cant ( P = 0.019) when comparing EBV with SoC ( see Table E8).",

Investigatorreported respiratory SAEs listed in Table 3 show that signi /uniFB01 cantly more subjects in the EBV group (35.2%) than in the SoC group (4.8%) experienced respiratory SAEs in the treatment period (day of procedure/randomization to 45 d) immediately after the bronchoscopy procedure ( P , 0.001). This difference was primarily caused by a higher frequency of pneumothoraces in the EBV group during the treatment period, which were managed according to previously published and protocolized pneumothorax management algorithm (22) ( see Figure E6). Select respiratory SAEs with onset after the most\nrecent bronchoscopy procedure are summarized in Table E13.\nHowever, during the longer-term period ( . 46 d until 12-mo visit), the frequency of events was comparable between groups with 33.6% of the EBV group subjects and 30.6% of the SoC group subjects experiencing one or more respiratory SAEs. During the longerterm period (Table 3), there was a lower frequency of SAEs (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations, pneumonias, and respiratory failure) in the EBV group than in the SoC group (23.0% vs. 30.6%, 5.7% vs. 8.1%, and 0.8% vs. 3.2%, respectively), although none of these differences reached statistical signi /uniFB01 cance.

Investigator-reported event rates are compared with the CEC adjudicated event rates; CEC adjudication removed any investigator bias on nomenclature and attribution of adverse events by using standardized de /uniFB01 nitions. Based on the CEC adjudication, during the treatment period, only the pneumothorax rate was signi /uniFB01 cantly different between groups with 0.275 events/45 days in the EBV group compared with no events in the SoC group ( P , 0.001).

This multicenter randomized controlled trial demonstrates that Zephyr EBV treatment in\nB\nC\nD\nSix-Minute Walk Distance (meters)\npatients with severe emphysema selected for little to no collateral ventilation between the treated and the ipsilateral lobe resulted in signi /uniFB01 cant lobar volume reduction, with consequent reduction in hyperin /uniFB02 ation, and clinically meaningful improvements in dyspnea, lung function, exercise-capacity, and quality of life. Similar results have been reported previously (14 -17).\nExcept for a higher proportion of categorically de /uniFB01 ned GOLD stage IV\nsubjects in the SoC group, the EBV and SoC groups were well matched for baseline demographics and clinical characteristics; including mean post-BD FEV1. However, this difference did not impact either the primary or secondary effectiveness outcomes based on analysis of covariance with baseline GOLD stage as a covariate.\nThe study met its primary endpoint with 47.7% EBV subjects compared with 16.8% SoC subjects achieving an\nimprovement in FEV1 of greater than Odds ratio (or) equal to 15% ( P , 0.001). Although the MCID cut off for change in FEV1 is highly variable, ranging from 10% to 15% (23), this threshold of 15% for the responder analysis was based on discussion with the Food and Drug Administration as the a priori threshold that they required for the pivotal U.S. trial. The absolute difference in means for FEV1 of 0.106 L signi /uniFB01 es a meaningful important clinical change (24).\nImportantly, 79.1% of patients in the EBV group achieved the MCID for TLVR at 45 days; and 84.2% at 12 months con /uniFB01 rming proper patient selection with Chartis and successful lobar occlusion. The overall mean change in target lobe volume radiographically determined by highresolution CT at 12 months was a reduction of 1.14 L, which corresponded to a mean reduction in RV of 0.5 L (or a 10.38% decrease from baseline). TLVR and consequent reduction in RV are consistent with the proposed mechanism of action of EBV and are comparable with changes after LVRS (25).\nThe major signi /uniFB01 cant side effect associated with the EBV procedure in the short-term treatment period was pneumothorax. Targeted lobar de /uniFB02 ation likely causes in /uniFB02 ation of the ipsilateral lobe, which can result in a tear of the already compromised parenchymal tissue of the emphysematous ipsilateral lobe, resulting in a pneumothorax.

Physicians performing EBV treatment must be trained on appropriate patient and lobe selection for treatment and anticipate and recognize a pneumothorax, which can be readily managed using standard approaches (22).\nThe difference between groups for the change from baseline to 12 months of 39 m in the 6MWD is meaningful and demonstrates the persistent bene /uniFB01 t EBV treatment provides in improving exercise tolerance in this patient group (27 -29). The absolute mean change in 6MWD in the EBV group at 12 months compared with baseline was only 13 m. However, left untreated, the decline in 6MWD in patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) at GOLD stage III/IV would be expected to be signi /uniFB01 cant over time (30). As an example, in the NETT (National Emphysema Treatment Trial) study, untreated control patients in the non -highrisk group showed declines of 40 m in the\n6MWD at 1 year (5). In this study, the 6MWD in the SoC group declined by 26.3 m from baseline to 12 months.

      "content": "improvements resulting from a reduction in hyperin /uniFB02 ation and improved lung function are consistent with similar /uniFB01 ndings after LVRS and warrant further study (32).\nAlthough prior randomized clinical trials of BLVR with Zephyr EBV treatment demonstrated improvements in lung function, exercise capacity, dyspnea, and quality of life compared with control subjects over a short-term period of 6 months, the LIBERATE study is the /uniFB01 rst trial to evaluate these outcomes compared with a control group over a longer period of at least 12 months while reinforcing the suitability of Zephyr EBV for both upper and lower lobe disease, and a wider range of baseline lung function ( , 20% compared with NETT) and baseline exercise tolerance. An additional important outcome in LIBERATE is the strong signal for the potential to reduce respiratory failure and Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations requiring hospitalization in the longer term, both being important goals of therapy for these patients. Taken together with the previous demonstration of its effectiveness in patients with both heterogeneous (14, 15, 17) and homogeneous (15, 16) emphysema selected for little to no collateral ventilation, unilateral EBV treatment now provides a\nviable treatment option for a group of patients with emphysema that is currently lacking. Unlike surgery or other bronchoscopic interventions (33 -36) EBVs are readily removable, allowing the procedure to be reversed if a patient does not respond or has complications.\nThe 27% frequency of pneumothorax SAEs in the treatment period is consistent with previous studies (16, 17) and the occurrence of pneumothorax does not seem to negatively impact clinical outcomes as seen in this study and previously reported by Gompelmann and coworkers (26) and Kemp and coworkers (17). Seventy-six percent of the pneumothoraces occurred within 3 days after the most recent bronchoscopy (index procedure for those who did not have a secondary bronchoscopy), and 85% were within 5 days after the most recent bronchoscopy procedure. These statistics support a minimum 3-day hospital stay after EBV procedure to ensure timely management of a pneumothorax if it occurs. As in previous studies, the speci /uniFB01 c algorithm for managing pneumothorax after EBV procedures developed by experts (22) was used to manage this consequence of the procedure during the present study and highlights the need for physicians performing\nthis procedure to have expertise in the management of procedural complications. One pneumothorax-related death at 13 days post-EBV procedure underlines the need to provide patients with clear instructions on recognizing symptoms of a pneumothorax and to seek emergent help if experiencing these symptoms.\nThe study has certain limitations. First, although many subjects did not meet the very strict inclusion/exclusion criteria that included baseline lung function measures, prior medical history, and so forth, 40% (280/706) of the screen failures were related to destruction score and heterogeneity requirements, the thresholds for which were arbitrarily chosen at the time the study was designed. Subsequent experience with homogenous patients in other trials (15, 16) has established the applicability of this therapy to a broader population. Similarly, the inclusion of subjects with little or no collateral ventilation was limited to their assessment with Chartis, which uses physiologic measures of air /uniFB02 ow and airway resistance for assessing collateral ventilation status. The more recent evolution of novel quantitative CT (QCT) techniques now enables the noninvasive screening of subjects for collateral ventilation, with immediate exclusion of subjects with less than 80% complete /uniFB01 ssure on QCT, Chartis requirement only in subjects with greater than 80% to less than 95% complete /uniFB01 ssure on QCT, and treatment with EBV of subjects with greater than 95% complete /uniFB01 ssure on QCT without Chartis (37, 38). This approach could have streamlined the screening out of subjects with completely absent /uniFB01 ssures and perhaps reduced some screening bronchoscopies in this study.\nA second limitation of the study was allowing a repeat bronchoscopy for valve revision/replacement only in subjects with TLVR less than 50%, and incomplete lobar occlusion based on the 45-day CT assessment by the Imaging Core Lab. These dual criteria were too restrictive and prevented many subjects from potentially bene /uniFB01 tting from a revision procedure. In clinical practice (20), repeat bronchoscopies for valve revision are performed based on clinical judgment if a patient has a lack of clinical response or experiences a sudden late loss of bene /uniFB01 t.\nThe observed bene /uniFB01 t to risk pro /uniFB01 le of EBVtreatment must be assessed considering the limited treatment options for patients\nwith severe emphysema. LIBERATE shows improvements over nontreated control subjects at the same magnitude as those seen after LVRS (EBV vs. LVRS: FEV1 [29], 17% vs. 19%; 6MWD [5], 39.3 vs. 44.7 m; SGRQ score [9], 2 7.05 vs. 2 13.9 points). However, Zephyr EBV treatment has less morbidity than LVRS: pneumothorax requiring chest tube (EBV vs. LVRS: , 30% vs. . 90%), respiratory failure (EBV vs. LVRS: , 30% vs. . 90%), and pneumonia (EBV vs. LVRS: 4% vs. 18%). Speci /uniFB01 cally, 90-day mortality after EBV is lower than LVRS with a rate of 3.1% compared with 5.0% in the LVRS non-high-risk group (39). Although the risks associated with LVRS are considered acceptable, this approach remains relatively underused (40). The only other remaining alternative of lung transplantation has a limitation of strict patient eligibility superimposed over the limited availability of donor lungs (41).",
