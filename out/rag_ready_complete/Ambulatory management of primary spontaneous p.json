      "content": "Pneumothorax  is  a  common  clinical  problem.  Primary spontaneous  pneumothorax  describes  patients  develop­ ing  pneumothorax  in  the  absence  of  trauma,  with  no underlying  established  lung  pathology,  and  occurs  in  in approximately 3000 patients per year in the UK. 1,2 Some patients can be managed conservatively with close obser­ vation, 3,4 but many symptomatic patients require an inter­ vention  to  re­expand  the  lung.  Current  British  Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines suggest that aspiration of trapped air using a cannula and syringe should be considered, but more than 50% of patients subsequently require the inser­ tion of a chest tube, which is then attached to an underwater seal drainage system. 4 The mean duration of hospitalisation of patients admitted for drainage is 6-8 days. 5\nAmbulatory management of patients with primary spon­ taneous  pneumothorax  potentially  removes  the  need  for\nlong hospital admission by facilitating outpatient treatment. Reducing the need for chest tubes with bulky underwater systems  might  allow  patients  to  remain  mobile  and facilitate early discharge with the device in situ. Ambulatory devices generally incorporate a Heimlich (one­way) valve, which replaces the traditional underwater seal, either by in­ line attachment to a standard chest tube or as part of an integrated device. However, the e/uniFB03cacy and safety of this approach has yet to be rigorously assessed. A systematic review 6 of  the  literature  found  that  18  studies  describing ambulatory  management  of  both  spontaneous  and  iat­ rogenic pneumothorax reported an overall success rate of 86%  and  successful  outpatient  management  in  78% of cases, with few complications. Unfortunately, the available evidence was described as poor quality with a high risk of bias, including two inadequately powered random­ ised trials and several retrospective case series. 6\nLancet 2020; 396: 39-49\nSee Comment page 4 Oxford Centre for Respiratory Medicine (R J Hallifax PhD) and Oxford Respiratory Trials Unit (M Laskawiec-Szkonter MA, Prof N M Rahman PhD) , University of Oxford, Oxford, UK; Royal Berkshire National Health Service (NHS) Foundation Trust, Reading, UK (E McKeown MRCP) ; Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK (P Sivakumar MRCP, A West MRCP) ; Queen Margaret Hospital, NHS Fife, Dunfermline, UK (I Fairbairn MRCP) ; Royal United Hospitals Bath NHS Foundation Trust, Bath, UK (C Peter MRCP) ; Western General Hospital, NHS Lothian, Edinburgh, UK (A Leitch PhD) ; West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust, Watford, UK (M Knight MRCP) ; Great Western Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Swindon, UK (A Stanton MRCP) ; University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust, Lancaster, UK (A Ijaz MBBS) ; Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK (Prof S Marciniak PhD) ; North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, UK (J Cameron FRCEM, J E Harvey MD) ; Blackpool Fylde and Wyre Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Blackpool, UK (A Bhatta FRCP) ; Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow, UK (K G Blyth MD) ; Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK (K G Blyth) ; Kettering General Hospital, Kettering, UK (R Reddy FRCP) ; Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, NHS Lothian, Edinburgh, UK (M-C Harris FCEM) ; University Hospitals of North Midlands, Stoke-on-Trent, UK (N Maddekar MRCP) ; Academic Respiratory Unit, University of\nBristol, Bristol, UK\nThe Randomised Ambulatory Management of Primary Pneumothorax  (RAMPP)  trial  was  done  to  determine whether ambulatory management of patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax is safe and reduces the length of hospitalisation.",

In 2013, a systematic review of 18 studies found that although ambulatory options might be successful, the data were of poor quality with a high risk of bias. A further three case series were subsequently published.

Following device insertion, patients were observed for 1-2 h to assess them for clinical stability, after which a chest radiograph was done (appendix p 44).\nIf  the  chest  radiograph  showed  insu/uniFB03cient  lung  re­ expansion,  the  ambulatory  device  remained  in  situ  and the  patient  was  discharged,  as  long  as  the  prespecified criteria  of  fitness  for  discharge  were  fulfilled.  These criteria consisted of all of the following: the patient agreed, had  clinically  stable  cardiorespiratory  observations,  had no  increase  in  the  size  of  pneumothorax  since  the  last radiograph  or  review,  did  not  require  oxygen  or  other respiratory support, was mobile and able to self­care, was provided with written information on point of contact and follow­up  plan,  and  lives  with  a  responsible  person  at home. Any patient not meeting these criteria  remained hospitalised  and  was  reviewed  daily.  Su/uniFB03cient  lung  re­ expansion  was  defined  as  complete  or  almost  complete re­expansion (<1 cm rim of air apically on chest radiograph) and being unable to aspirate air through the device using a connector and syringe.\nIf  discharged  home  with  the  device  in  situ,  patients were reviewed as an outpatient every 1-2 days (generally daily,  but  a  single  review  during  the  weekend  was su/uniFB03cient  if  clinically  stable)  until  day  4,  at  which  stage the  patient  should  be  considered  for  thoracic  surgery. The timing of the ongoing outpatient review after day 4 was at the discretion of the responsible clinician. After each  review,  if  there  was  su/uniFB03cient  re­expansion  of  the lung and no ongoing air leak, the device was removed and  the  patient  was  discharged.  A  postremoval  chest radiograph  was  done  to  ensure  that  the  lung  had  not recollapsed. If  the  chest  radiograph  showed  recurrence of  pneumothorax,  the  patient  was  rehospitalised  for observation  and  consideration  of  the  placement  of  a standard chest tube connected to an underwater seal.\nPatients who were in the control arm received standard treatment  as  per  the  2010  BTS  Pleural  Guidelines. 4 In brief, pleural aspiration (if the clinician deemed  it appropriate) was attempted under local anaesthetic using a 14-16 gauge cannula and syringe, aspirating a maximum of 2·5 L. The patient was observed for 1-2 h to assess for clinical stability, and a repeat chest radiograph was done. If the repeat chest radiograph showed su/uniFB03cient lung re­ expansion, the patient was discharged. If the lung had not su/uniFB03ciently  re­expanded,  then  a  small­bore  chest  tube (≤14 F) was inserted and attached to an underwater seal, and the patient was admitted to hospital.\nAlthough  initial  aspiration  was  recommended  in  the trial protocol,  the  responsible  clinician  was  able  to proceed directly to chest tube insertion and admission at their discretion, in line with BTS guidelines. 4 Decisions regarding  chest  tube  removal  were  as  per  standard practice at participating centres but included no further air leak (as shown by a non­bubbling chest tube) and full lung expansion on chest radiograph. A postremoval chest radiograph  was  done  to  ensure  that  the  lung  had  not\nrecollapsed. Fitness for discharge criteria were assessed daily  to  provide  equality  between  treatment  groups. Evidence  for  the  use  of  suction  in  patients  with  pneu­ mothorax  is  poor.  BTS  guidelines  suggest  that  high volume,  low  pressure  suction  should  not  be  routinely used  but  could  be  considered  if  there  is  prolonged  air leak. 4 Use  of  suction  was  at  the  discretion  of  the  local responsible clinician.\nPatients were followed up at 1 week after the completion of treatment, and 30 days, 6 months, and 12 months after randomisation. Hospital admissions and pneumothorax recurrence  were  measured  up  to  the  day  30  follow­up point, and at each follow­up point, data were collected on further  hospital  admissions,  pain  and  breathlessness visual  analogue  scale  (VAS)  scores,  quality  of  life,  and smoking  status.  Patients  who  were  not  able  to  attend face­to­face  follow­up  appointments  were  contacted  by telephone to check for complications or recurrence, and if this was not possible, data on recurrence was collected through hospital or general practitioner medical records. Data on pneumothorax recurrence at 6 and 12 months will  be  presented  separately  with  data  from  the  obser­ vational cohort.",

      "title": "Outcomes",
      "content": "The primary outcome was the total length of hospital stay up  to  30  days  after  randomisation,  including  initial hospital  stay  and  re­admissions.  Patients  remaining  in hospital overnight were recorded as having a 1­day stay; those discharged on the same day (either after successful needle aspiration treatment or discharge with the ambulatory device) were recorded as zero length of stay. The  30­day  point  was  chosen  on  the  basis  of  previous data  suggesting  that  most  conservatively  treated  (non­ surgical)  primary  spontaneous  pneumothorax  air  leaks resolve  within  14  days  of  initial  treatment, 8 and  thus outcomes measured at 30 days were considered reliably to capture all related re­admissions. Patients with missing data at 1 week after treatment or 30 days after randomisation were assumed to have no re­admissions. Re­admission  was  defined  as  the  need  for  emergency (non­planned)  admission  to  hospital  for  any  reason  in relation  to  pneumothorax  but  was  not  restricted  to  the requirement for a further pleural intervention. Any re­ admission  to  hospital  was  recorded  as  at  least  a  1­day stay.  Planned  day  case  reviews  for  outpatient  treated patients were not included.\nSecondary  outcomes  included  the  need  for  a  further pleural  procedure,  adverse  events,  pain  and  breath­ lessness VAS scores, recurrence rates, and time o/uniFB00 work because  of  pneumothorax  treatment.  Further  pleural procedures were defined as any intervention that punctured  the  pleura  (eg,  chest  drain  insertion)  after a first treatment intervention. We obtained a daily record of thoracic pain and breathlessness scores using a VAS score  up  to  day  4  after  randomisation,  which  was measured on a scale of 0 to 100 mm. A score of 0 indicated\nthe  complete  absence  of  symptoms  and  100  was  the maximum possible level of symptoms, which is validated for  assessment  of  breathlessness  in  patients  having pleural procedures. 9,10 VAS scores were also recorded on completion  of  treatment.  Because  patients  could  be discharged  with  a  small  residual  pneumothorax,  those with a persistent small pneumothorax at 1­week follow­ up were defined as having ongoing pneumotho  rax rather than a new occurrence. The recurrence of pneumotho­ rax  was  defined  as  a  new  episode  of  symptomatic pneumothorax after full resolution on chest radiograph, or  occurring  after  the  1­week  follow­up  visit.  Several other secondary outcomes  including quality of life questionnaires (EuroQol­5D­5L), blood parameters, and digital air flow analysis are planned for separate publications.\nConcerning the failure of medical treatment, there is no robust evidence on the optimal timing for surgical intervention in primary spontaneous pneumothorax after initial  treatment  in  the  presence  of  ongoing  air  leak. Current BTS guidelines suggest that cases of persistent air leak  or  non­re­expansion  should  be  referred  for  surgery after  3-5  days. 4 To  achieve  objective  outcomes  for  this study,  the  following  criteria  were  developed  to  ensure\nconsistent practice in both groups, and were recorded in all  cases.  Referral  for  thoracic  surgery  occurred  in  the presence of all of the following: (1) persistent air leak on day 4 after insertion of chest tube (as measured by bubbling chest tube attached to an underwater seal) or evidence of ongoing air leak through the ambulatory device; (2) persis­ tent pneumothorax on chest radiograph; (3) patient agreed to  have  surgery;  and  (4)  no  contraindication  to  thoracic surgery.\nSafety  data  were  collected  for  all  patients  at  each  trial visit regarding adverse events, with seriousness defined as per Good Clinical Practice guidelines. 11 Expected adverse events were pain at the drainage site, minor haemorrhage not requiring specific intervention (eg, blood transfusion or surgery), subcutaneous emphysema, pleural infection, unintentional removal (falling out) of the Pleural Vent or chest tube, recurrence of pneumothorax or worsening of ongoing  pneumothorax  (if  evidence  of  failure  of  full resolution  following  initial  intervention),  re­expansion pulmonary  oedema,  and  the  need  for  further  (non­ emergency) pleural procedures. Expected serious adverse events included tension pneumothorax occurring during treatment,  blockage  of  chest  tube  with  clinical  con­ sequences (eg, patient unwell or further procedure required),  major  intrathoracic  haemorrhage  requiring specific  intervention  (eg,  blood  transfusion),  and  any additional emergency pleural procedure as deemed necessary  by  the  local  investigator  (eg,  large  bore  chest tube insertion). Because the recurrence of pneumothorax is common  and  expected  (occurring in  about  33% of  primary  spontaneous  pneumothorax  cases  within 1 year 1,12 ), recurrence was not reported as a serious adverse event.  Adverse  events  were  assessed  locally,  and,  if  they fulfilled the criteria for a serious adverse event, 13 they were reported  immediately  (ie,  within  24  h)  to  the  Oxford Respiratory  Trials  Unit  for  review.  All  serious  adverse events were followed until resolution.",

Based on these param­ eters, with 80% power, a 5% two­sided significance level, and a 10% attrition rate, the study required 236 patients. Previous pleural studies have shown an attrition rate for the primary outcome measure of less than 5%. 14-16",

Pre­planned sensitivity analyses were done to assess the robustness of  the  primary  outcome.  Survival  analysis  techniques were  used  to  compare  time  to  discharge  between  the two  groups  using  the  Gehan­Breslow­Wilcoxon  test (more appropriate than the log­rank test because of  a  high  early  event  rate  in  primary  spontaneous pneumothorax)  and  using  Cox  proportional  hazards regression  to  calculate  a  hazard  ratio  and  associated 95% confidence interval. An analysis of hospital stay in hours (instead of whole days) was done using identical methods  to  the  primary  analysis.  The  Student's t test was used to compare mean di/uniFB00erences in length of stay.\nA worst­case scenario sensitivity analysis of the primary outcome  was  done  by  assigning  the  longest  possible initial hospital day to those patients who were missing follow­up forms in the ambulatory care arm.\nContinuous secondary outcome measures were analysed using ANCOVA adjusting for baseline scores.

      "content": "We  recruited  patients  between  August  27,  2015,  and March 12, 2019. After approaching 776 potentially eligible patients, we reached our target of 236 (30%) participants, of whom 117 were assigned to ambulatory care and 119 to\nstandard care (figure 1). The mean age at recruitment was 30 years (SD 8). 193 (82%) patients were male, 58 (25%) had a history of previous pneumothorax, and 20 (8%) had a family history (first­degree or second­degree relative) of pneumothorax (table 1). 161 (68%) patients were current or  former  tobacco  smokers,  with  a  median  pack­year history for both groups combined of 8 (IQR 5-12), and 114  (48%)  were  current  or  former  marijuana  smokers (table  1).  Most  patients  were  symp  tomatic  with  either chest pain (213 [90%]) or shortness of breath (210 [89%]).\nFor  the  primary  outcome,  we  analysed  114  (97%)  of 117 patients who received ambulatory care and 113 (95%) of 119 who received standard care, because data was not available for the remaining patients. Among those who had ambulatory care, the median hospital stay in the first 30  days  was  0  days  [IQR  0-3],  which  was  significantly lower than in those who received standard care (4 days [IQR  0-8]; median  di/uniFB00erence  2  days,  95%  CI  1-3; p<0·0001).  The  cumulative  incidence  of  hospital  stay (comprising  any  initial  hospital  stay  plus  re­admission days  in  hospital)  is  shown  in  figure  2.  The  di/uniFB00erence in  overall  hospital  stay  during  30  days  was  also  signif­ icant  when  calculated  in  hours  (ambulatory  median 4·7  h  [IQR  2·7-59·2] vs standard  care  median  74·7  h [IQR 6·3-178·2); p<0·0001; table 2). In the ambulatory care  group,  73  (64%)  of  114  patients  with  available  data were discharged on the same day as admission, compared with  39  (34%)  of  115  patients  with  available  data  in the  standard  care  group  (p<0·0001; appendix  p  3).  In 24 patients (12 in ambulatory care; 12 in standard care), data were missing either at 1­week or at 30­days follow­ up, or both.\nRe­admission rates were similar in the ambulatory and standard care groups (table 2). The time until successful completion of treatment, defined as when the ambulatory device was removed (ambulatory care) or when the patient had a successful outcome from aspiration or chest tube\nremoval after drainage (standard care), was significantly longer in patients in the ambulatory care group (table 2). The  total  time  o/uniFB00  work  did  not  di/uniFB00er  between  groups, with a mean of 10·7 days (SD 11·9) in the ambulatory care group and 11·5 days (SD 13·0) in the standard care group.\nThe  prespecified  subgroups  also  showed  di/uniFB00erences in hospital stay, including for previous history of pneumothorax and smoking history  (tobacco  and  mar­ ijuana;  table  3).  The  tests  for  interactions  were  not significant  in  any  of  the  subgroup  analyses;  hence, conclusions cannot be drawn about di/uniFB00erential benefits in the subgroups.\nIn the worst­case scenario sensitivity analysis, median hospital  stay  in  the  first  30  days  remained  significantly shorter  in  those  who  received  ambulatory  care  (1  day [IQR  0-6])  than  in  those  who  received  standard  care (4 days [IQR 0-8]; median di/uniFB00erence 1 day, 95% CI 0-2; p=0·0057).\nBecause not all patients in the standard care arm had aspiration,  we  did  a  post­hoc  analysis  of  the  primary outcome excluding patients in whom no aspiration was done (ie, who proceeded directly to chest drain insertion as  per  clinician  preference).  Removing  the  31  (26%)  of 119 patients in whom no aspiration was attempted in the standard  care  arm,  the  primary  outcome  still  favoured the  intervention  arm.  The  median  length  of  stay  for patients  in  the  standard  care  arm  in  whom  aspiration was  done  was  3  days  (IQR  0-8),  and  the  median di/uniFB00erence was 1 (95% CI 0-3; p=0·0001).\nRegarding  the  secondary  outcomes,  initial  treatment data was available for 227 (96%) of 236 patients. Docu­ mented per­protocol compliance with allocated treatment was 114 (97%) of 117 patients receiving ambulatory care and  113  (95%)  of  119  patients  receiving  standard  care. Among  119  patients  receiving  standard  care, initial management was pleural aspiration in 81 (68%) patients,\n38  (47%)  of  whom  subsequently  required  chest  drain insertion.  31  (26%)  of  119  patients  receiving  standard care were initially managed with a chest drain (table 4).\nFollowing the initial intervention, patients who received ambulatory care required fewer total pleural procedures (mean 1·2 [SD 0·5]) than did those who received standard care  (mean  1·4  [SD  0·7];  p=0·0327),  and  40  (33·6%)  of 119 patients who received standard care required one or\nData are n (%) unless otherwise indicated. *Data not recorded on database.\nmore further pleural procedures (table 4). Surgical referral rates were similar in both groups, including 33 (28%) of 117 patients who received ambulatory care and 26 (22%) of 119 patients who had standard care. Of patients referred for surgery, 21 (64%) in ambulatory care and 19 (73%) in standard care then had a surgical procedure.\nMean pain and breathlessness VAS scores were high at baseline and improved with treatment in both treatment groups  (figure  3).  Reported  pain  after  the  first  inter­ vention was similar in both groups and improved during days 1-4. There was no significant di/uniFB00erence in analgesia use between the two groups during days 0-4 (appendix pp 5-6).\nAmong the study population, 1 week after completion of treatment,  26  (12%)  of  220  patients had  an  ongoing pneumothorax (not requiring admission) and 27 (12%) had a  recurrence  (appendix  p  7).  The  proportion  of  patients with recurrence at day 7 was lower in the ambulatory care group (8  [7%]  of  110  patients)  than  in  the  standard  care group  (19  [19%]  of  110  patients;  p=0·02).  Of  19  patients receiving  standard  care  with  recurrence,  10  (53%)  were initially treated with aspiration, five (26%) had aspiration then chest tube insertion, and four (21%) had chest tube insertion.  A  further  19  patients  (9%)  had  a  recurrence between day 7 and day 30.\nFollow­up  data  were  available  up  to  12  months  for 181  (77%)  of  236  patients,  with  the  remainder  lost  to follow­up.  Recurrence  rates  from  1-12  months  were\nData are n (%). *Patients could have more than one adverse event. †Required admission and chest tube insertion.\nTable 5: Adverse events\nsimilar in the ambulatory  and  standard care  arms (appendix p 7). The overall rate of ipsilateral pneumothorax recurrence up to 12 months was 24% for the ambulatory arm  and  28%  for  the  standard care  arm  (p=0·22; appendix p 8). Recurrence­free survival curves are shown in the appendix (p 4).\n110 (47%) of 236 patients had adverse events (table 5), including 64 (55%) of 117 patients in the ambulatory care arm  and  46  (39%)  of  119  in  the  standard  care  arm. 97 (39%) patients had intervention­related or treatment­ related adverse events.\nAll 14 serious adverse events occurred in patients who received ambulatory care, and these events were all rated as  serious  on  the  basis  of  the  need  for  re­admission  to hospital  (table  5).  Eight  (57%)  of  the  14  serious  adverse events were related to the intervention (and some patients had more than one serious adverse event): four (3%) of 117  patients  receiving  ambulatory care had an enlarging pneumothorax  on  repeat  chest  radiography  at  outpa­ tient  review,  which  required  admission  and  chest  tube insertion; for two (2%) patients the device malfunctioned (tube  kinked  or  blocked);  one  (1%)  patient  had  radio­ graphic evidence of (asymptomatic) pulmonary oedema at review on day 1, but was admitted for observation without overnight  stay;  one  (1%)  device  was  leaking  fluid;  the device dislodged in one (1%) patient, requiring chest tube placement; and one (1%) patient was admitted for suction. The remaining four serious adverse events were haemo­ pneumothorax (n=3 [3%]) and pleurisy (n=1 [1%]), which were  all  judged  to  be  unrelated  to  the  intervention.  All three  patients  with  unrecognised  haemopneumothorax had  chest  radiographic  evidence  of  significant  fluid  (in addition to pneumothorax) before the intervention. These three patients either had surgery or CT angiography that did  not  identify  an  intervention­associated  source  of bleeding.\nThe  most  frequent  non­serious  adverse  events  were pain at the insertion site, haematoma or bleeding, surgical or subcutaneous emphysema, and failure of the drainage device (table 5).",

      "content": "This multicentre, open­label, randomised  controlled tri  al  compared  an  ambulatory  treatment  strategy  for primary spontaneous pneumothorax with standard care using evidence­based guidelines (aspiration, chest drain insertion,  or  both),  using  clinically  relevant  outcomes including  the  duration  of  hospital  stay  during  the  first 30  days  following  intervention.  The  results  show  the e/uniFB03cacy  of  the  ambulatory  strategy,  with  most  patients successfully  managed  as  outpatients.  This  finding  is supported by analysis of the primary outcome by initial hospital and overall stay in both whole days and number of hours.\nAlthough 24 (21%) of 114 patients who had ambulatory care required at least one further procedure, patients in this group required significantly fewer procedures overall\nthan  those  who  received  standard  care.  Patients  in the  ambulatory  group  had  longer  treatment  duration (ie,  time  with  ambulatory device in place) than did the standard care group (ie, time with chest drain in place). This di/uniFB00erence  is  probably  due to a number of factors. First,  physicians  might  have  been  more  cautious  in managing patients with the ambulatory device and left the device in situ longer to ensure it was not removed too soon.  Second,  because  patients  in  the  ambulatory  care group were being managed as outpatients and reviewed every  24  h,  there  were  fewer  opportunities  to  assess whether the pneumothorax had resolved than there were for those with a chest tube, who were treated in hospital and potentially reviewed many times per day.\nSerious adverse events, defined as those needing admission to hospital, occurred exclusively in the ambulatory  care  arm.  Serious  adverse  events  related to  treatment  included  enlargement  of  pneumothorax despite the ambulatory device being in place and device blockage  and  kinking,  requiring  chest  tube  insertion and hospitalisation. In the ambulatory care group, three patients had unrecognised haemopneumothoraces, which at review were not considered related to the inter­ vention.  Although  this  higher  rate  of  serious  adverse events is clearly important, by the nature of its definition it is biased against the ambulatory arm. Insertion of a chest tube (eg, after failed aspiration) and admission to hospital was not a possible serious adverse event in the standard care arm because this constituted normal care. Therefore, any adverse event in a patient already hospitalised, regardless  of  the  primary  intervention,  requires  careful interpretation.  Nonetheless,  the  increased  adverse  event rate in the ambulatory arm should be accounted for when using an ambulatory pneumothorax strategy.\nNo significant di/uniFB00erences between intervention groups were observed in secondary outcome measures in terms of VAS pain or breathlessness scores, time o/uniFB00 work, and overall recurrence at 30 days. However, the pneumothorax recurrence rate within 7 days of treatment completion was higher in those who received standard care. Recurrence at this early stage is unusual and is often presumed to be due to enlargement of an ongoing pneumothorax. As a result, investigators classified patients with pneumothorax within  7  days  into  two  categories:  ongoing  if  there  had been  incomplete  re­expansion  on  chest  radiograph  at completion of treatment, or new  recurrence if the pneumothorax  had  fully resolved on the last chest radiograph.  The  excess  recurrence  in  patients  receiving standard care was not entirely due to patients treated with aspiration  alone,  because  they  accounted  for  less  than 53% of those with early recurrence.\nLonger­term recurrence rates (1-12 months) were similar between the two groups. Despite excess recurrence in the standard care arm by 30 days, the cumulative rate of first ipsilateral recurrence was not statistically di/uniFB00erent at 12  months.  The  overall  rate  of  recurrence  (27%)  is consistent with previous large epidemiological studies. 1,12\nA 2020 randomised trial 3 in primary spontaneous pneumothorax compared conservative management (ie, no intervention) with standard care (ie, chest tube insertion), 3 reporting that the conservative approach was non­inferior to standard care in the primary outcome of resolution of pneumothorax on chest radiograph at 8 weeks. We have concerns about the widespread adoption of this approach. First,  the  trial  screened  more  than  2600  patients  to  ran­ domly assign  316,  and  it  required  39  sites  recruiting  for 6  years.  Excluding  patients  with  previous  pneumothorax would automatically exclude about 25% of the population. The reasons for which all other patients were excluded in the trial are unclear. The trial might therefore be applicable only to those patients with minimal symptoms, and it is already recognised that conservative management is whol­ ly  appropriate  in  some  cases  of  primary  spontaneous pneumothorax  (as  stated  in  the  2010  BTS  guidelines 4 ). Second, the primary outcome was radiological, rather than patient­centred (eg, symptoms, time in hospital). Few data are presented on patient symptoms except at 2 weeks and what was termed an overall satisfaction score. Therefore, although  the conservative treatment  study  should  be applauded for showing reduced inpatient hospital stay, we would suggest  that  symptomatic  patients  who  choose  or are  chosen  by  the  treating  physicians  for  intervention should be considered for the ambulatory treatment strategy, which is shown here to be e/uniFB00ective and reasonably safe.\nThere are limitations to this study. Some eligible patients were  not  enrolled  because  they  presented  out  of  the 0900-1700 National Health Service working hours or when no  trained  members  of  sta/uniFB00  were  available.  This  factor introduces a potential recruitment bias, be  cause patients presenting  out  of  hours  could  be  more  unwell,  and thus ambulatory management should be used cautiously in  those  patients.  However,  this  prospective  trial  was pragmatic  in  its  design  and  the  patients  who  enrolled were  likely  to  represent  those  suitable  for  ambulatory management. The study was necessarily open label with both patients and physicians aware of treatment allocation; however,  the  use  of  objective  and  identical  discharge criteria  were  used  for  the  primary  outcome  measure  to ensure balance between treatment groups. Finally, not all patients in the standard care arm had pleural aspiration as initial management, which could have introduced bias to­ wards the ambulatory arm. However, a post­hoc analysis excluding these patients showed that the primary outcome remained significantly di/uniFB00erent between the two arms.\nConsidering the data in the present study, what is now the optimal treatment for patients with primary spontaneous  pneumothorax  who  require  treatment?  To our knowledge,  our  results show  for the first time evidence of e/uniFB00ective use of an entirely ambulatory strategy in patients with symptomatic primary spontaneous pneumothorax, as compared with current evidence based standard  care.  The  ambulatory  strategy  was  associated with  reduced  hospital  stay  and  did  not  result  in  higher surgical or recurrence rates, but it did show an increase in\nadverse  events related to  readmission.  Despite  these readmissions,  the  total  number  of  pleural  procedures required and median hospital stay were significantly lower in  patients  in  the  ambulatory  arm.  These  results  have important implications for practice and suggest that future guidelines should include an ambulatory treatment option. We argue that this study provides strong evidence that the ambulatory  strategy  should  replace  the  initial  treatment (both aspiration and chest tube insertion) that forms the basis of current management guidelines. The ambulatory device  used  in  this  trial  was  the  Pleural  Vent  (Rocket Medical). Ambulatory treatment might be just as e/uniFB00ective with any ambulatory treatment strategy (eg, a chest drain attached  to  a  one­way  valve),  but  other  devices  were  not tested in this study. It should be noted, however, that an ambulatory  treatment  strategy  for  primary  spontaneous pneumothorax will require health­care services to develop ambulatory  care  facilities  to  allow  patients  to  be  safely followed up with the device in situ.\nIn  conclusion,  in  patients  with  primary  spontaneous pneumothorax, ambulatory management significantly reduces  the  duration  of  hospital  stay  during  30  days. Outpatient management is now a reasonable and prob  ably preferable option in the management of this condition.",
