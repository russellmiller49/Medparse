CHEST 2019; 155(3):639-644\nKEY WORDS: interventional pulmonary; respiratory failure; tracheostomy; tracheotomy\nSince Ciaglia et al 1 introduced the percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy (PDT) in 1985, bedside PDT is often performed by many surgeons and nonsurgeons in the ICU. 2 The procedure has evolved past earlier controversies to the point of proven ef /uniFB01 cacy, safety, and clinical outcomes. 3,4 In addition, the procedure can minimize operating room scheduling issues and delays, and save hospital resources. 5,6 For these reasons, PDT performed in the ICU is now a widely recognized option. In many ICUs such as ours, it has become the tracheostomy procedure of choice.\nGiven recent trends showing increased numbers of patients undergoing tracheostomy, 7,8 a demand in expertise for tracheostomy procedures exists. Should pulmonologists and intensivists include PDT in their practice, it may become a source of professional satisfaction as well as added practice productivity.",

Furthermore, a meta-analysis by Higgins and Punthakee 13 reported no signi /uniFB01 cant difference when comparing overall complications, with a trend toward favoring the percutaneous method. PDT still has limitations and risks, including possibly a higher incidence of decannulation and obstruction. Furthermore, some investigators have proposed a learning curve for PDT, noting possible increased complications in patients operated on by inexperienced operators or in institutions where the procedure is performed infrequently. 14 Therefore, early experience with PDT is recommended under controlled settings. Notably, the American College of Surgeons still recommends bedside PDT as the procedure of choice, even in high-risk patients. 11",

      "content": "Absolute and relative contraindications, as with other procedures, are often a matter of debate (Table 1). Most published articles consider cervical injury, pediatric age, coagulopathy, and emergency airway necessity as absolute contraindications. For inexperienced operators, especially nonsurgeons, we recommend avoiding such cases. We do note that with increasing experience, PDT can be performed safely in select patients who are morbidly obese, 15 have short, fat necks, 16 with coagulopathy, 17 have neck or cervical trauma, 18 and even those with high oxygen requirements. 19 These latter conditions require increased operator and team experience in PDT prior to performance; in some centers, these may be best accomplished via an open surgical approach. Therefore, in deciding between percutaneous and open surgical approaches, relevant factors may also include skills of the operating team,\nlocal resources, and anatomic and physiologic considerations highlighted earlier. Newer operators are cautioned to gain substantial experience with PDT prior to performing it in more complex circumstances.",

      "content": "Key personnel who are familiar with the procedure will assist the primary surgeon or pulmonologist and enhance procedure facilitation and patient safety. In our institution, the team would include the operating physician, an airway assistant (typically another physician or advanced care practitioner), a bedside nurse, and a respiratory therapist at a minimum. We also have a second assistant across the bed from the operator, usually a resident or fellow in training, but in other centers this person may include an operating room technician or physician assistant. In some institutions, an anesthesiologist may serve to assist the sedation and airway strategies, especially if skilled respiratory therapy support is not available. It is critical that the airway assistant and the respiratory therapist are familiar with each step of the procedure as to not prematurely remove the endotracheal tube prior to con /uniFB01 rmation of the tracheostomy. During the procedure, the airway will intermittently become partially compromised with the dilator and insertion of the tracheostomy tube. This action will result in frequent ventilator alarm triggering that requires diligent monitoring by a respiratory therapist to ensure the airway is not truly lost; this is especially concerning in patients with higher oxygenation and/or positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) requirements (eg, FIO 2 > 0.6 and/or PEEP > 12 cm H2O). The bedside nurse monitors the patient and vital signs and, in cases in which the procedure is performed under moderate sedation, the nurse might be asked to administer sedation and analgesia. In some institutions, the sedation and analgesia may be",

The PDT team is assembled at the bedside with a commercially available PDT tray. Some kits are allinclusive packages with chlorhexidine-based preparation, full-body drapes, syringes, dilator, lidocaine with 1/ 100,000 epinephrine, suture, needle driver/hemostat, and 8.0-mm cuffed regular tracheostomy tube. Emergent airway supplies such as a laryngoscope, endotracheal tubes of varying sizes, and a hemodynamic resuscitation cart should be immediately available at the bedside in the event of unplanned emergencies. A /uniFB02 exible bronchoscope with video monitor is positioned in sight of the operator close to the bed. Although tracheostomy can be performed with local analgesia and moderate (conscious) sedation, many institutions such as ours prefer deeper sedation and liberal analgesia strategies.

The guidewire is placed with care to move caudally toward the carina, and subsequent dilational procedure occurs. The dilator is a hydrophiliccoated instrument that facilitates smoother dilation. The dilator is removed, and the tracheostomy tube is placed through the tract. Clinical con /uniFB01 rmation is performed, and the tube is then secured as per usual methods. Bronchoscopic con /uniFB01 rmation, as well as qualitative or quantitative end-tidal carbon dioxide con /uniFB01 rmation of tracheal placement, is recommended.

      "content": "Training requirements for PDT have not been well de /uniFB01 ned. As with many other invasive surgical procedures, we believe a combination of didactics and simulation-based training and testing should be used prior to embarking on the procedure. We acknowledge that training does not translate directly into competency, credentialing, or mastery.\nFor reference, the American College of Chest Physicians Interventional Pulmonary Procedures Guidelines recommends at least 20 procedures 29 in a supervised setting to establish basic competency for the physician performing the procedure, and an annual experience of 10 cases to maintain credentialing. The American\nCollege of Chest Physicians Guidelines are based on expert consensus and have been helpful to establish basic competency and credentialing procedures. We agree with these recommendations but suggest that additional structured didactics, simulation-based training, and co-training of the entire PDT ' team ' may be needed. This approach may be important especially when performing the procedure in lower volume centers, with less readily available surgical backup, or when attempting more complex cases.\nNotably, speci /uniFB01 c training requirements for PDT are not included in training requirements for the pulmonary and critical care fellowships as documented by the American Board of Internal Medicine. 30 We recognize that interventional pulmonary training programs will often incorporate PDT 31 ; however, we postulate that lack of emphasis on procedures such as PDT in general programs may affect adoption of this procedure.\nThe number of cases required to be credentialed may vary by institution; those planning on pursuing credentialing should verify the process with hospital bylaws and medical executive committee recommendations. Similarly, institutions may vary regarding if PDT should be singled out as a special privilege vs a core privilege under surgery or critical care. In our practice, it is a special privilege for pulmonologists but a core privilege for surgeons.",

      "content": "Pulmonologists and surgeons will need to make themselves available for bedside PDT for the duration of the procedure with minimal interruptions and distractions. For expediency, some practices have designated proceduralists to allow clinical emergencies and interruptions to be handled by others. Some practices also have a backup individual(s) who can perform the procedure or manage complications when others are not available.\nAlthough complications are infrequent, nonsurgeons and less experienced operators should consider consulting with others who might assist in the event of a complication. We recommend being mindful of periprocedural hypotension related to sedation, clinical monitoring for signs and symptoms of hemorrhage, tube dislodgement, site infection, and subcutaneous emphysema. Other complications may include tracheal stenosis, pneumonia, tracheitis, sternoclavicular osteomyelitis, or tracheoesophageal /uniFB01 stula. 32\nPostprocedurally, we recommend daily examination of the tracheostomy tube, sutures, and cleaning of the inner cannula for the /uniFB01 rst 7 days. Around the seventh day, we aim for suture removal along with planning for the /uniFB01 rst tracheostomy tube change by a member of the operating team. For patients on full ventilator support, we generally remove sutures alone and maintain the tracheostomy tube until weaning has occurred. Following the /uniFB01 rst tracheostomy tube change, subsequent tracheostomy tube changes are performed by respiratory and nursing personnel. 33 Following weaning from mechanical ventilation, the decannulation process begins with feedback from our nursing, respiratory therapy, and speech-language pathology colleagues in a team-based fashion as others have shown. 34 For patients unable to be decannulated or who have residual tracheal concerns, we offer clinic appointments for follow-up to discuss issues and reexamine the need for tracheostomy. Exchanging and cleaning of tracheostomy tubes varies depending on disease states, secretions, cleaning patterns, and physical location per protocol. 35 Often, local respiratory resources, pulmonologists, or surgeons may be equipped to manage patients ' tracheostomy needs.",

      "title": "Coding and Billing",
      "content": "Coding and documentation requirements can vary according to payer as well as by region. Local insurance carriers and coding experts should be consulted. We routinely bill by using Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code 31600 for ' Tracheostomy, Planned Procedure. ' This code is for both PDT and for open tracheostomy and is inclusive of all bedside preparation time speci /uniFB01 c to the procedure itself. We do not bill for the tracheostomy supplies because the hospital bills all surgical supplies. Some surgeons do not bill follow-up evaluation and management visits related to the\n[ 155#3\nCHEST\nMARCH 2019\n]\ntracheostomy because they assume there is a global period and, therefore, the visits are nonpayable. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services fee schedule, tracheostomy procedures include zero global days, which means any visit or service performed one or more days following surgery in a Medicare patient is payable separately. 36 Some commercial payers, however, do impose a 10-day global period on CPT 31600. 37 Because our teams are usually caring for the patient ' s respiratory needs, we often incorporate documentation relevant to tracheostomy care as per subsequent evaluation and management encounters. Other codes of note:\n/C15 Tracheostomy tube change prior to establishment of /uniFB01 stula tract CPT 31502, used for premature tracheostomy tube changes (eg, balloon rupture, or tube dislodgement) prior to epithelialization of the tract (usually by the seventh postoperative day).\n/C15 Routine bronchoscopy (CPT 31622), although often helpful with PDT, cannot be billed without clear documentation showing that it was medically necessary to perform a separate procedure. Separate procedures can include a diagnostic BAL (CPT 31624) or bronchoscopy with therapeutic clearance of secretions or blood (CPT 31645 for initial procedure, or 31646 for subsequent procedure); again, documentation needs to indicate that these procedures are medically necessary.\n/C15 In the clinic, if a tracheostomy tube is changed, durable medical equipment may then be billed for supplies, including tracheostomy tubes using Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes A7520 (tracheostomy tube, uncuffed), A7521 (tracheostomy tube, cuffed), or A7522 (tracheostomy tube, stainless), tracheostomy masks (A7525), tracheostomy collars/holders (A7526), and tracheostomy caps (A7527).",
