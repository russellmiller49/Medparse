    "abstract": "Rationale: Patients with malignant pleural effusions have signi /uniFB01 cant dyspnea and shortened life expectancy. Indwelling pleural catheters allow patients to drain pleural /uniFB02 uid at home and can lead to autopleurodesis. The optimal drainage frequency to achieve autopleurodesis and freedom from catheter has not been determined. Objectives: To determine whether an aggressive daily drainage strategy is superior to the current standard every other day drainage of pleural /uniFB02 uid in achieving autopleurodesis. Methods: Patients were randomized to either an aggressive drainage (daily drainage; n = 73) or standard drainage (every other day drainage; n = 76) of pleural /uniFB02 uid via a tunneled pleural catheter. Measurements and Main Results: The primary outcome was the incidence of autopleurodesis following the placement of the indwelling pleural catheters. The rate of autopleurodesis, de /uniFB01 ned as complete or partial response based on symptomatic and radiographic changes, was greater in the aggressive drainage arm than the standard drainage arm (47% vs. 24%, respectively; P = 0.003). Median time to autopleurodesis was shorter in the aggressive arm (54 d; 95% con /uniFB01 dence interval, 34 -83) as compared with the standard arm (90 d; 95% con /uniFB01 dence interval, 70 to nonestimable). Rate of adverse events, quality of life, and patient satisfaction were not signi /uniFB01 cantly different between the two arms. Conclusions: Among patients with malignant pleural effusion, daily drainage of pleural /uniFB02 uid via an indwelling pleural catheter led to a higher rate of autopleurodesis and faster time to liberty from catheter. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 00978939). Weperformed a randomized, single-blinded, phase IV, multicenter clinical trial at 12 centers in the United States from 2009 to 2013 (the ASAP [Impact of Aggressive versus Standard Drainage Regimen Using a Long-Term Indwelling Pleural Catheter] trial).

Patients are often symptomatic with shortness of breath, cough, or chest pain and have a short life expectancy with a median survival of 3 to 12 months based on the type of the cancer (1). Current management options are centered on symptomatic improvement and include repeated thoracentesis, chemical pleurodesis via tube thoracostomy or thoracoscopy, indwelling pleural catheter (IPC), and, rarely, surgical decortication (2).\nThe IPC was introduced in the late 1990s as a less invasive and effective alternative to chemical pleurodesis (3). It involves placement of a silicone catheter with its distal part residing in the pleural space, middle part tunneled under the skin and soft tissue, and proximal part laying outside the body and accessible for drainage. The proximal hub of the catheter has a self-sealing valve access that can be connected to disposable vacuum bottles allowing intermittent drainage of pleural /uniFB02 uid on an outpatient basis.\nData gradually emerged showing the IPC to be a viable outpatient management option for patients suffering from malignant pleural effusions with high success in relief of dyspnea and low complications rate (4 -11). Randomized controlled studies, comparing IPC with chemical pleurodesis using talc or doxycycline via tube thoracostomy, found them equally effective\nin relieving dyspnea with the added advantage of outpatient placement and management (3, 12, 13). Autopleurodesis, de /uniFB01 ned as spontaneous cessation of pleural drainage without instillation of a chemical agent in the pleural space and relief of dyspnea, was achieved in 46 -51% of patients with IPC (3, 12).\nAlthough the use of IPC rapidly expanded in the last decade (14), questions remain about optimal frequency of drainage and its impact on achievement of autopleurodesis; adverse events (AEs), such as infection; and patient tolerability of frequent outpatient-based drainage. The primary objective of this trial was to compare an aggressive daily drainage strategy with the current standard every other day drainage of pleural /uniFB02 uid in achieving autopleurodesis, with secondary objectives of time to autopleurodesis (TTAP), quality of life, satisfaction of patients and caregivers, and AE rate.",

Patients who could not meet the 12-week end time point because of patient factors or catheter/disease factors necessitating catheter removal were marked as ' unable to complete study ' and their data were included in the analysis up to the point where they left the study.\nCR was de /uniFB01 ned as a decline in the quantity of pleural /uniFB02 uid to less than or equal to 50 ml on three consecutive attempted drainages, radiographic scores of 0 -1, and lack of symptoms (shortness of breath, cough, or chest pain). PR was de /uniFB01 ned the same except for a radiographic score of 2 -5. Lack of response was de /uniFB01 ned as failure to achieve autopleurodesis by 12 weeks with the patient continuing to drain /uniFB02 uid via the catheter.\nIPCs can become clogged with clots or /uniFB01 brin and cease to function as a drainage conduit. To differentiate catheter dysfunction from autopleurodesis, patients with drainage\nquantity of less than or equal to 50 ml of pleural /uniFB02 uid on three consecutive drainages and visible pleural /uniFB02 uid on CXR (radiographic score of 2 -5) were brought to the hospital ' s procedure room and underwent an attempt at restoring catheter /uniFB02 ow.

However, if /uniFB02 ow was not restored and the patient was not symptomatic, the catheter was removed with classi /uniFB01 cation of the patient as PR.

The autopleurodesis rate observed in the conservative drainage arm of our study (24%) was lower than previously reported in other trials, which had used every other day or less frequent drainage schedule (42.9 -51%) (3, 12, 14). This could be explained by the shorter follow-up period of our study (12 wk) as opposed to followup until catheter removal or death in other studies. Our decision to choose the 12-week follow-up period was predicated on the average survival of patients with malignant pleural effusions and the knowledge that autopleurodesis is less likely to occur past the 12-week postinsertion time point.\nWe de /uniFB01 ned partial pleurodesis as a decline in the quantity of pleural /uniFB02 uid to less\nDefinition of abbreviations : CI = confidence interval; RAND MOS SF-36 = RAND Medical Outcome Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey. All areas have possible score range of 0 to 100, where higher scores are associated with more favorable health states. Difference is calculated as aggressive 2 standard. Sample sizes are n = 73 and n = 72 for aggressive and standard arm, respectively; for preinsertion,\nn = 55 and n = 54 for 2 wk; and n = 15 and n = 12 for 12 wk.\nthan or equal to 50 ml on three consecutive attempted drainages, radiographic scores of 2 -5, and lack of symptoms (shortness of breath, cough, or chest pain). None of our study subjects who achieved PR had a radiographic score of 5; only one patient had a score of 4 and the rest had a score of 3 or less.\nThe mortality rate in our study was higher than expected despite the investigators following the study protocol in excluding patients with projected life expectancy less than or equal to 30 days as predicted by KPS score of less than 30. A study by Burrows and coworkers (15) of 85 patients with malignant pleural effusions showed a median survival of 395 days when the KPS score is greater than or equal to 70, as opposed to a median survival of 34 days with a KPS score of less than or equal to 30. The average KPS score in our study was greater than 60 in both arms. Our inexact prediction likely signals the heterogeneous nature of malignant pleural effusion and the inherent imprecision in relying on clinical factors or weakly validated\nassessment tools. The rate of patients ' inability to complete the study to 12 weeks in both arms was expected and re /uniFB02 ected the deteriorating health of the advanced cancer patient.\nThe AE rate of IPCs was acceptable with no difference between the two arms. Chest pain during drainage is relatively common and usually managed by slowing or terminating /uniFB02 uid withdrawal. Only three patients had to leave the study because of chronic pain associated with the catheter. The infection rate was low in our study ( , 3% overall) and was not higher in the aggressive drainage arm as may be feared because of more frequent accessing and maneuvering of the pleural catheter. A recent large international multicenter study found an infection rate of 4.9% associated with the IPC with a median time to infection of 62 days (interquartile range, 39 -177) after catheter insertion (16).\nOur study was not blinded to patients or investigators but we attempted to detect bias by assessing the level of agreement in CXRs scores (on a scale from 0 to 5) between the treating physician and an independent blinded review. CXR scores were an integral part in classifying the primary outcome of autopleurodesis and were found to be similar ( . 92% agreement in scores at all assessment points of the study).\nPatients ' scores on both the SF-36 survey and KPS were similar between the two arms. This likely re /uniFB02 ects the positive perceived impact of the IPC on quality of life regardless of drainage frequency.\nWith the widespread use of IPC as an outpatient treatment option for malignant pleural effusion, there is some concern that the burden of care has been shifted to the patients and their families and potential\nhardship at home has been imposed. Our study surveyed patients and their caregivers and found a high level of satisfaction with management of catheters at home and willingness to choose this treatment option again. This likely re /uniFB02 ects a well-known desire for even terminal patients to maintain a degree of autonomy that is inherent in the self-management of the IPC.\nPrior cost analyses have compared the cost-effectiveness of the IPC with talc pleurodesis in patients with malignant pleural effusions and found them to be either less costly or have similar to slightly higher costs but with a de /uniFB01 nitive advantage of the IPC when survival is short (6 -14 wk) (17 -19). Our study did not address the cost of care and it is not known at this time if the shorter time to pleurodesis may offset the cost of using drainage bottles on a daily basis in the aggressive approach. There may also be an additional cost when the home drainage is performed by a visiting nurse; however, most patients in our study either drained themselves or relied on a family member to do so. Ultimately, the bene /uniFB01 ts of dyspnea relief and freedom from catheter may outweigh the potential increase in cost.\nIn conclusion, daily drainage of the IPC in patients with malignant pleural effusions, as compared with every other day drainage, led to more frequent and rapid autopleurodesis. Quality of life and AEs were similar with either approach. Our /uniFB01 ndings should inform the choice of clinicians and patients on drainage frequency and weigh into a customized approach that incorporates consideration of ef /uniFB01 cacy, social support, and available resources. n\nAuthor disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org.",
