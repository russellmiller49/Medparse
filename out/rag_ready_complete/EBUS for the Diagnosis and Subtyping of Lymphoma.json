The WHO recommends the use of multidimensional diagnostic modalities, including cytomorphologic studies, immunophenotyping, cytogenetic analyses, and molecular studies to accurately subtype lymphoma (1 -4).\nSurgical excision and core biopsy are the current preferred sampling techniques for\ndiagnosing lymphoma, but there is growing interest in using less invasive endoscopic techniques with lower complication rates (5). In patients who present with intrathoracic adenopathy that is suspicious for lymphoma, endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUSTBNA) is an attractive option, given the risks of surgical or core needle sampling (6, 7). In such patients, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA also may\nbe useful for excluding alternative diagnoses, such as sarcoidosis, and may help to identify patients who require more invasive tissue sampling (8, 9).\nThe diagnostic utility of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA in lung cancer diagnosis and staging, including biomarker analysis, has been well established (10, 11). Emerging data suggest that Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, along with appropriate immunohistochemical, /uniFB02 ow cytometric,\ncytogenetic, and molecular studies, can de /uniFB01 nitively diagnose lymphoma (12, 13). Nonetheless, because disease management often hinges on the pathologic subtype and grade, there is concern that the smaller samples obtained via Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA compared with those obtained by surgical or core needle biopsy may be insuf /uniFB01 cient to guide treatment decisions. Even in our high-volume dedicated cancer center, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA is only used in a minority of patients with suspected lymphoma.\nThere is a paucity of data on whether Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA provides adequate tissue samples for diagnosing and subtyping lymphoma (i.e., no additional biopsies are required for pathologic subtyping and grading). Additionally, sensitivity and speci /uniFB01 city have been reported in most of the studies on Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for lymphoma in the literature; however, sensitivity and speci /uniFB01 city can have only two possible results: positive or negative. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA typically has more than two meaningful possible results. For diagnostic tests in which there are more than two meaningful results, the use of likelihood ratios is more appropriate, because it re /uniFB02 ects the information value of each of the categories separately. Therefore, in this study, we determined on the basis of likelihood ratios whether Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA could accurately diagnose and subtype lymphoma in patients with isolated intrathoracic adenopathy that was suspicious for lymphoma.",

Suspected recurrent lymphoma was de /uniFB01 ned as new intrathoracic adenopathy or a mediastinal mass observed on imaging scans in patients with a clinically compatible presentation and a history of lymphoma. Clinically compatible presentation was determined by the referring physician and included any of the following: B symptoms (fever, night sweats, and/or weight loss), cytopenia, and/or peripheral lymphadenopathy.\nThe Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA results were classi /uniFB01 ed according to the pathologic diagnosis, as follows:\n1. Lymphoma that could be subtyped : Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was diagnostic of lymphoma and subtyping was possible using solely the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA sample; no additional tissue sampling was required.\n2. Lymphoma that could not be subtyped : Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA demonstrated cells that were consistent with lymphoma on the basis of cytomorphologic or immunophenotypic features, but additional tissue sampling was required to subtype the disease.\n3. Speci /uniFB01 c nonlymphoma diagnosis : EBUSTBNA diagnosed a condition other than lymphoma. For example, the /uniFB01 nding of acid-fast organisms in addition to granulomas was consistent with mycobacterial disease. The /uniFB01 nding of other forms of cancer was also considered de /uniFB01 nitive.\n4. Granulomatous in /uniFB02 ammation without a speci /uniFB01 c diagnosis : Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA demonstrated granulomas but no speci /uniFB01 c diagnosis by direct staining. If granulomas were present and staining identi /uniFB01 ed a pathogen (e.g., acid-fast organisms) in the same Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA sample, establishing a speci /uniFB01 c diagnosis (e.g., tuberculosis), it was classi /uniFB01 ed as a speci /uniFB01 c nonlymphoma diagnosis rather than as granulomatous in /uniFB02 ammation without a speci /uniFB01 c diagnosis.\n5. Adequate lymphocytes but no speci /uniFB01 c diagnosis : Adequate benign lymphoid tissue was present on at least one EBUSTBNA specimen.\n6. Inadequate lymphocytes but no speci /uniFB01 c diagnosis : No cytologic evidence of lymph node sampling was present.\nAll patients were assigned a /uniFB01 nal diagnosis by the treating multidisciplinary hematology oncology and pulmonary team on the basis of a review of their clinical, pathologic, microbiologic, and radiologic data, with follow-up for at least 6 months. The /uniFB01 nal diagnostic categories were as follows:\n1. De novo lymphoma : Final diagnosis of lymphoma in a patient with no history of lymphoma\n2. Relapsed lymphoma : Final diagnosis of lymphoma in a patient with a history of lymphoma\n3. Other malignant diagnosis : Nonlymphoma malignancy on /uniFB01 nal diagnosis\n4. Speci /uniFB01 c infectious disease : Findings established by microbiologic cultures in the appropriate clinical context (e.g., histoplasmosis and tuberculosis)\n5. Sarcoidosis : A diagnosis of sarcoidosis was based on clinicopathologic criteria if granulomas were found, there was a compatible clinical history, and other causes of granulomatous disease had been excluded.\n6. Other nonspeci /uniFB01 c benign diagnosis : If no speci /uniFB01 c disease was found on EBUSTBNA or another diagnostic test or biopsy and the patient was observed for a minimum of 6 months with no changes, the condition was classi /uniFB01 ed as benign.\nThose diagnosed with lymphoma were subclassi /uniFB01 ed as having Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), or low-grade NHL.",

      "content": "We studied the ability of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA to diagnose lymphoma by asking two distinct questions. The /uniFB01 rst was how effective EBUSTBNAwas in determining whether a patient had lymphoma. However, identifying that a patient has lymphoma is not always suf /uniFB01 cient, because the precise subtype of lymphoma dictates treatment. Therefore, the second question was how effective Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was in determining the subtype of lymphoma present so that treatment decisions could be made.\nTo determine whether Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA could diagnose lymphoma, we used likelihood ratios. We considered all patients with a /uniFB01 nal diagnosis of de novo or relapsed lymphoma to have lymphoma; this served\nas the reference standard of truth. Patients with any other /uniFB01 nal diagnosis were considered not to have lymphoma. A diagnosis of lymphoma included all lymphomas, even those that could not be\nsubtyped. We used likelihood ratios to determine whether Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA could diagnose lymphoma because they allow the interpretation of diagnostic tests that have more than two possible results.\nDefinition of abbreviations : Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)=endobronchial ultrasound; FDG= fluorodeoxyglucose; NHL = non-Hodgkin lymphoma.\nFor the outcome of the ability of EBUSTBNA to diagnose and subtype lymphoma, we calculated sensitivity and speci /uniFB01 city. For this analysis, all Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA lymphoma results that could be subtyped were classi /uniFB01 ed as true positives. Those that could not be subtyped were classi /uniFB01 ed as negative. All other Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA results were also classi /uniFB01 ed as negative for lymphoma.

We used x 2 tests or Fisher ' s exact test to compare categorical variables and the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test to compare continuous variables.\nLikelihood ratio was de /uniFB01 ned as the probability of seeing the result in those with the disease divided by the probability of\nseeing the result in those without that disease. As applied to this study, we were interested in likelihood ratio (lymphoma present), likelihood ratio (granulomatous in /uniFB02 ammation), likelihood ratio (adequate lymphocytes), and likelihood ratio (inadequate lymphocytes). We applied Bayes ' theorem to further re /uniFB01 ne the diagnostic utility of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for lymphoma diagnosis. Because the results are not dichotomous, we calculated posttest odds, which in turn were estimated by multiplying the pretest odds by the likelihood ratio.

      "content": "Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA established a diagnosis in 84% of patients with lymphoma. In association with /uniFB02 ow cytometry and immunohistochemical analysis, it had an overall sensitivity of 77%, speci /uniFB01 city of 100%, and NPV of 86% in the diagnosis and subtyping of de novo and recurrent lymphoma. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA performed the best among patients with a /uniFB01 nal diagnosis of low-grade NHL, with a 92% sensitivity rate. The sensitivity for HL was signi /uniFB01 cantly lower; however, because of the small sample size, we could not demonstrate a difference between high- and low-grade NHL. Remarkably, no patients with granulomatous in /uniFB02 ammation in our study developed or were diagnosed with lymphoma, which is contrary to the\ntraditional belief that granulomatous in /uniFB02 ammation is indicative of persistent or new lymphoma (14).\nThe /uniFB01 ndings in this study are similar to those of an earlier review of patients referred for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA between August 2005 and December 2006 at our institution (15). In that study, we reported our initial experience in 25 patients, among whom lymphoma was ultimately diagnosed in 11 patients. In that study, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA identi /uniFB01 ed lymphoma in 10 (90.9%) of 11 patients with lymphoma, which is similar to the 84% we found in this study (15). However, in addition to the weakness inherent in any small study, one of the criticisms of our prior study was that patients in whom additional tissue was obtained for purposes of subtyping were included among the true positives. In that study, two patients identi /uniFB01 ed as having lymphoma required additional biopsies for subtyping; thus, the ability of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA to diagnose and subtype lymphoma was 72.7%, which is similar to our present /uniFB01 nding.\nThe sensitivity of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for diagnosing and subtyping lymphoma in this study was somewhat lower than the 89% reported by Moonim and coworkers; however, their analysis included 16 patients with paired tissue samples that provided an additional con /uniFB01 rmation of the diagnosis, and they also described immunophenotyping techniques not routinely available in the United States (16). Interestingly, they reported that an EBUSTBNA diagnosis was adequate for clinical management in 52 (79%) of 66 lymphoma\ncases, a /uniFB01 nding that is similar to our own. We found a much higher sensitivity than the 57% reported by Steinfort and colleagues (17), even after categorizing lymphoma that could not be subtyped as a false negative. That study, however, consisted of a far smaller patient population than that in our current study, with 44% of their patients suspected of sarcoidosis; in addition, the use of /uniFB02 ow cytometry was not reported.\nOur /uniFB01 ndings are in contrast to those reported by Iqbal and coworkers, who found an overall diagnostic sensitivity of 29% and a surprising nondiagnostic rate of 52% for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA (18). Our Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA technique is different from that reported by those authors. We typically use a 22-gauge needle, perform an average of /uniFB01 ve passes per lymph node and perform cell counts to obtain 1 million cells. We also tend not to rely on subjective estimates of visible cores. Notably, on the basis of prior experience at our institution reported by Caraway and colleagues (19), immediate on-site assessment is necessary for an appropriate diagnostic workup of lymphoproliferative disorders in patients with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. We always triage material to ensure that adequate material is available for cytologic or ancillary studies, especially for immunophenotyping at the time of biopsy (19).\nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was less sensitive for diagnosing HL in our study, which is consistent with the /uniFB01 ndings of other investigators and may re /uniFB02 ect the scarcity of the characteristic Reed-Sternberg cells that are needed for the diagnosis (Figure 1) (16).\nAdditional tissue was needed in 19% of HL cases versus 2% of NHL cases ( P = 0.009).\nIn our study, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA had many gradations of positive and negative results. As we observed, a positive diagnosis of lymphoma that can be subtyped is different from a positive diagnosis of lymphoma that cannot be subtyped, because treatment depends on the subtype. In some studies, a diagnosis of lymphoma in which the speci /uniFB01 c subtype was not determined by Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was considered a negative result (16). However, this result is not the same as having inadequate lymphocytes. An initial diagnosis of lymphoma justi /uniFB01 es more invasive testing to determine the subtype. Similarly, a speci /uniFB01 c nonlymphoma diagnosis is informative, even if it is negative for lymphoma. Although this is clinically obvious, the likelihood ratio provides subtle insights into these other categories of results. In this study, we found that the negative result of granulomatous in /uniFB02 ammation reduced the probability of lymphoma to almost zero. This is different from a negative result of inadequate lymphocytes. However, when complex histologic interpretations are simpli /uniFB01 ed as either positive or negative, this information is lost, as is the ability to discriminate.\nThe clinical implications of our /uniFB01 ndings depend not only on the likelihood ratio but also on the pretest probability of disease. In patients with suspected de novo lymphoma, the prevalence of lymphoma was 26%. As Figure 2 shows, if the pretest probability of lymphoma is 26% and EBUSTBNA demonstrates adequate lymphocytes, the posterior probability will be 8%. In contrast, patients with suspected recurrent lymphoma have a higher pretest probability of disease, as would be expected. In this study, the prevalence of recurrent lymphoma was 51%. If the pretest probability of lymphoma is 51% and EBUSTBNA demonstrates adequate lymphocytes, the posterior probability will be 21%. In contrast, the posterior probability of disease will be much lower if Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA demonstrates granulomas, even in patients with a history of lymphoma.\nWe have integrated the concepts of pretest probability and likelihood ratios for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA into a new diagnostic algorithm for patients with suspected lymphoma (Figure 3). If a patient has suspected de novo lymphoma and EBUSTBNA shows granulomatous in /uniFB02 ammation or adequate lymphocytes, careful\nobservation with serial computed tomography (CT) and clinical follow-up is indicated, provided that the pretest probability is fairly low (as it was in our study and others) (15, 17, 20). On the one hand, if a patient has suspected recurrent lymphoma and Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA shows granulomatous in /uniFB02 ammation, observation and serial CT are required. On the other hand, if a patient has suspected recurrent lymphoma and Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA shows adequate lymphocytes, the approach may\ndepend on the initial subtype of lymphoma. As in other studies, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA appears to be more sensitive for diagnosing lowgrade NHL than HL and high-grade NHL. Observation is indicated in patients with a history of low-grade NHL if the EBUSTBNA reveals adequate lymphocytes. However, in patients with HL or high-grade NHL, the use of another biopsy technique may be warranted.\nThe limitations of this study include its retrospective design, rather than being\na randomized trial or a study of multicenter registries. It involves a relatively small number of patients, and it is prone to selection bias because only patients referred for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA were included; patients referred directly for surgical sampling were not included. In addition, as the posterior probabilities in our study are contingent on the prior probabilities, our results may not be generalizable to other patient populations, owing to differing lymphoma prevalence. Our patients were evaluated in a dedicated cancer center, so a referral bias compared with other centers cannot be excluded. Among patients with no prior history of lymphoma, we made every effort to clinically exclude patients in whom granulomatous disease such as sarcoidosis or mycobacterial disease was suspected.\nEven after clinicoradiographic workup, however, there is inevitably a group of patients that require invasive tissue sampling. Because isolated mediastinal lymphoma is a relatively rare disease, it is also inevitable that a majority of such patients will end up with diagnoses other than lymphoma. In studies of isolated intrathoracic adenopathy that was not particularly suspicious for de novo lymphoma, lymphoma prevalence was as low as 4% (21). The prevalence of de novo\nlymphoma in our study was 26%, which is very similar to other published studies in this patient population, in whom lymphoma prevalence has ranged from 21% to 60% (15 -17, 20).\nPatients with a history of lymphoma constitute an important group in whom the appearance of new intrathoracic adenopathy clearly raises the specter of recurrent lymphoma and usually warrants invasive testing. This level of suspicion is borne out by our /uniFB01 ndings that fully 51% of these patients were ultimately diagnosed with lymphoma. This is very similar to prior published studies where the prevalence of lymphoma ranged between 43% and 61% for relapsed lymphoma, and our /uniFB01 ndings suggest that Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA can be very useful in this setting (15, 18, 19). For illustration purposes, we equated prevalence with pretest probability; however, clinical decision making should be driven by the pretest probability for an individual patient (based on the medical history, physical, and other diagnostic tests) rather than by the prevalence in a population. Also, the number for de novo lymphoma cases is small in our study; the con /uniFB01 dence intervals are wide; and the generalizability of the /uniFB01 ndings may be limited because of the small sample size for this particular subgroup of patients.\nThe generalizability of our results also depends on the amount of pathology resources available and the specimen handling methods used. Our study population received care at a dedicated cancer center with a multidisciplinary team approach that included on-site cytopathology support and dedicated hematopathologists. Particularly among patients with suspected lymphoma relapse, the pathologists were not blinded to the prior history, and this could have in /uniFB02 uenced the results. All our samples were screened on site for cellularity, and quantitative cell counts were performed to con /uniFB01 rm the samples ' adequacy for ancillary testing, including /uniFB02 ow cytometry. This screening allowed us to make procedural decisions, such as increasing the number of passes to maximize the yield. In addition, when granulomas or lymphocytes were found on rapid on-site evaluation, cultures were obtained to provide a de /uniFB01 nitive diagnosis. If these resources are not available and used in conjunction with Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, EBUSTBNA may not perform as well.\nIn summary, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA is effective at diagnosing suspected lymphoma in patients with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The present study, with 75 lymphoma cases, is the largest case series thus far describing the\nperformance characteristics of EBUSTBNA in this population. We also demonstrated that Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA not only can diagnose the presence of lymphoma but also can provide suf /uniFB01 cient information for subtyping in most cases. Also, by using likelihood ratios rather\nthan conventional sensitivity and speci /uniFB01 city, we demonstrated that certain Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA /uniFB01 ndings, such as granulomas, are associated with a low posterior probability of lymphoma. Given the higher discriminatory function and superior ability to predict posterior\nprobability of disease, LRs may be more useful for clinical decision making than conventional sensitivity and speci /uniFB01 city. n\nAuthor disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org.",
