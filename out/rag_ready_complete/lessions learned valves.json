STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This single-center retrospective study analyzed patients undergoing endoscopic valve implantation with and without pneumothorax after intervention. Emphysema characteristics, collateral ventilation, management, and outcome of patients with pneumothorax 3 months after valve implantation were assessed. Pneumothorax was categorized as severe (chest tube insertion, prolonged air leak requiring valve removal), moderate (chest tube, no valve removal), and mild (no chest tube). RESULTS: Pneumothorax occurred in 102 of 532 patients (19%) and was significantly more common after valve placement in the upper lobes (31.3%) compared with the lower lobes (11.3%; P < .001). Fissure integrity was significantly higher in patients with pneumothorax (mean, 96.6 ± 6.3% vs 93.4 ± 10.3%; P = .002). Of all pneumothoraces, 30.4% were mild, 30.4% were moderate, and 39.2% were severe. Severe pneumothorax caused multiple complications and prolonged hospitalization.

It can improve lung function, exercise capacity, symptoms, quality of life, 1 and even survival. 2,3 However, endobronchial valve implantation also is associated with potential complications such as Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, hemoptysis, and valve dislocation. 4 Pneumothorax is one of the most common immediate complications of valve implantation.\nThe development of pneumothorax after valve implantation is complicated and different from other forms of pneumothorax. It usually develops as a result of rapid expansion of the adjacent lobe after complete atelectasis of the target lobe, which is associated with tension and tearing of the lung tissue or rupture of a bleb or bulla. Over the years, the pneumothorax rate has increased to 17.6% to 34.4% since the absence of collateral ventilation was identi /uniFB01 ed as a key factor in the success of valve implantation and patients have been selected accordingly. 5 Several factors have been identi /uniFB01 ed as predictive of pneumothorax, such as the Emphysema\nIndex (EI) of the adjacent lobe, the size of the adjacent lobe in relationship to the hemithorax, the predominant type of emphysema, 6 and pleural adhesions, 7 or are highly suspected as risk factors, such as complete /uniFB01 ssures, homogeneous emphysema, and rapid onset of lobar atelectasis. 5 Treatment pathways for the management of pneumothorax are already established, although some of the recommendations, such as the stepwise approach for valve removal for pneumothorax, are based on expert consensus, rather than evidence. 5\nThe severity of a pneumothorax after intervention varies. 8 Pneumothorax ex vacuo describes a condition in which the acute collapse of the target lobe causes a sudden increase in negative intrapleural pressure, and gas and blood are drawn into the pleural space from the surrounding tissues. 5 These patients usually do not require a chest tube drainage and bene /uniFB01 t greatly from the procedure. Pneumothorax after valve implantation in general was reported to have no negative effects on the survival of the patient. 9 The 4-year survival rate is even highest in patients with pneumothorax and complete lobar atelectasis (84.8%) compared with patients with complete lobar atelectasis without pneumothorax (73.1%). 2 However, severe forms of pneumothorax also can be accompanied by complete collapse of the lung and persistent air leak requiring further measures, such as valve removal, respiratory ventilation support, or surgical closure of the /uniFB01 stula in the case of a parenchyma leakage. Deaths after severe pneumothorax also have been reported. 10,11\nClinical experience suggests that these patients with severe pneumothorax do not bene /uniFB01 t from endobronchial valve implantation and even risk a worsening of the underlying disease. The aim of this study was to characterize different types of pneumothorax and their outcomes in a high-volume center for endoscopic lung volume reduction, paying particular attention to the event of severe pneumothorax.",

      "content": "This retrospective analysis of 102 patients with pneumothorax after valve implantation revealed several /uniFB01 ndings. Pneumothorax was more likely to occur with intact /uniFB01 ssures and after valve placement in the upper lobes, particularly in the LUL. A lower risk of pneumothorax was observed in patients with an upfront Chartis measurement, especially if the low/uniFB02 ow phenotype was observed. A strati /uniFB01 cation of pneumothorax by severity after occurrence seems to be useful, because patients with mild and moderate pneumothorax showed a high success rate of atelectasis, whereas the event of severe pneumothorax often was associated with complications and poor clinical outcome. In addition, valve reimplantation was associated with an increased risk of repeat pneumothorax.\nThe incidence of pneumothorax was signi /uniFB01 cantly higher after valve placement in the upper lobes and highest after valve placement in the LUL in our study. The scienti /uniFB01 c community has been uncertain whether valve placement in the upper lobes is associated with an increased risk of pneumothorax. 5 Gompelmann et al 6 could not show that\nupper target lobes were a predictor of pneumothorax, but only patients with a complete lobar atelectasis were analyzed in this study. Two previous trials from 2015 14 and 2016 15 con /uniFB01 rmed the increased incidence of pneumothorax after valve placement in the LUL (29.4% and 30.1%, respectively). This means that when the LUL is occluded with valves, the adjacent left lower lobe does not expand suf /uniFB01 ciently and tears. This may be because occlusion of a large LUL, which has more segments with the lingula than the right upper lobe, exerts more traction on the left lower lobe during closure. However, this /uniFB01 nding needs further investigation.\nIn contrast, the increased occurrence of pneumothorax in complete /uniFB01 ssures (without the need for Chartis measurement) is expected. It is well known that the Chartis measurement is not a 100% reliable method for assessing collateral ventilation and that the low/uniFB02 ow phenotype is a false-negative /uniFB01 nding in 30.2% of all measurements. 16 Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that pneumothorax is less common in intermediate /uniFB01 ssures where Chartis measurement is required and collateral ventilation may still be present. This study cannot answer whether the relative absence of pneumothorax in patients with a Chartis measurement also indicates a lower treatment bene /uniFB01 t of valve implantation, but this should be investigated in the future.\nThe severe pneumothorax rate of 39.2% in this study was higher than reported in previous studies\n(Continued)\n(ie, 0%-11.6%), 5 most probably because of improved patient selection with a higher rate of complete /uniFB01 ssures. Patients with severe pneumothorax had multiple complications and showed no long-term bene /uniFB01 t from therapy; 1 patient even died. Whether their clinical condition and lung function may even deteriorate cannot be answered from our study, because many patients did not return for follow-up after valve removal. It is clear that only those patients with pneumothorax who keep their valves (or have them reimplanted) bene /uniFB01 t. A high atelectasis rate was observed in these\npatients. This is in line with data from Gompelmann et al, 2 who showed that the 4-year survival rate was highest in patients with complete lobar atelectasis and pneumothorax (84.8%) compared with patients with complete lobar atelectasis without pneumothorax (73.1%), patients without atelectasis or pneumothorax (60.1%), and patients with pneumothorax without concomitant atelectasis (54.4%).\nOur study identi /uniFB01 ed the size of the hyperin /uniFB02 ated target lobe and valve placement in the LUL as potential risk\nData are presented as No. or mean /C6 SD. Statistically signi /uniFB01 cant results appear in boldface. 6MWD ¼ 6-minute walk distance; CAT ¼ Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Assessment Test; DLCO ¼ diffusion capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide; LVR ¼ lung volume reduction; mMRC ¼ modi /uniFB01 ed Medical Research Council; NA ¼ not applicable; RV ¼ residual volume; SB ¼ single breath; TLC ¼ total lung capacity; VA ¼ alveolar volume; VC ¼ vital capacity.\nfactors for the development of severe pneumothorax. In contrast, the Pulmonx Endobronchial Valves Used in Treatment of Emphysema (LIBERATE) study 11 showed that patients were at higher risk of so-called complex pneumothorax (de /uniFB01 ned as death or complete valve removal) if the lobe with the highest destruction score was not treated and the EI of the untreated contralateral lung was > 60% (EI measured at -910 Houns /uniFB01 eld units).\nTo our knowledge, this is the /uniFB01 rst study to provide detailed data on the risk of repeat pneumothorax after valve reimplantation. Recurrence rates of 17% and 29% have been reported from 2 centers without details. 5 Valve reimplantation after removal for pneumothorax was associated with an increased risk of repeat pneumothorax in this cohort, especially when all valves had to be removed (75% risk of repeat pneumothorax). The decision for valve reimplantation therefore should be discussed critically with the patient, although it is dif /uniFB01 cult to derive clinical recommendations from these few retrospective data.\nThe main limitation of this study is its retrospective nature. It represents a re /uniFB02 ection of clinical practice, which is already adapted to expert consensus guidelines 5 and clinical experience with pneumothorax. A prospective evaluation of pneumothorax incidence and other speci /uniFB01 c clinical scenarios in patients with a high risk of pneumothorax developing after valve (re)implantation (eg, those with bullous or paraseptal emphysema or those with complete immediate valve removal) in a randomized controlled study has severe ethical restrictions. Therefore, observational studies must continue to be conducted and used to verify previous assumptions about the development of pneumothorax. Another weakness of the study is that the basic cohort of all patients with valve implantation has not been characterized fully. Therefore, it is not possible to reliably predict (severe) pneumothorax from this study and to make further comparisons between patients with and without pneumothorax. The analysis of /uniFB01 ssure integrity was carried out by experienced radiologists and not by quantitative CT imaging in our study. This may have limitations in the informative value of the /uniFB01 ssure integrity, even if the results seem reliable.\nIn the future, studies including large cohorts with and without severe pneumothorax after valve implantation should come closer to predicting severe pneumothorax. Something like a score that can predict the occurrence of pneumothorax better, especially severe pneumothorax, and that can be used in daily clinical practice, certainly\nwould be helpful. Studies on the prevention of pneumothorax, such as the sequential valve implantation approach, 17 should concentrate on severe forms of pneumothorax in terms of cost-bene /uniFB01 t analysis, because the prevention of mild pneumothoraces without the need for further invasive measures and with a good outcome does not seem to be necessary.",

      "content": "The data presented allow for a more accurate assessment of pneumothorax risk and for patients to be informed more individually about the expected risk of (severe) pneumothorax depending on the target lobe and /uniFB01 ssure integrity. A categorization of the severity of pneumothorax, and in particular a distinction between severe pneumothorax and mild or moderate pneumothorax, seems to be useful for further studies and reporting, because severe pneumothorax is an enormous burden for the patient and is not associated with the same therapeutic success as mild and moderate pneumothorax. The possibility of valve reimplantation after complete valve removal resulting from severe pneumothorax should be discussed critically with the patient, because the risk of repeat pneumothorax is high. Although valve implantation has become a routine procedure in many hospitals, the complications of this procedure still need to be considered. Future research should focus on the prediction and prevention of severe forms of pneumothorax.",
