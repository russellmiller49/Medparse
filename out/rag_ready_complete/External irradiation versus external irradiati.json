      "title": "1. Introduction",
      "content": "Radiotherapy is an effective treatment modality in the palliation of most respiratory symptoms among patients with inoperable non-small cell lung cancer (Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)) [18,20,21,26]. In two randomized studies conducted by\nthe Medical Research Council (MRC) investigating different palliative schedules in inoperable Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the rates of symptom relief varied from 48 to 65% for cough, from 72 to 86% for haemoptysis and from 59 to 80% for chest pain [20,21].\nIn a large number of studies, the results of endobronchial brachytherapy (EBB) with or without external irradiation (XRT) as palliative treatment for centrally localized lung cancer have been reported [5,6,11,13,22,24,30]. In earlier\nwww.elsevier.com/locate/radonline\nstudies, EBB was particularly used as palliative treatment in case of endobronchial recurrences after XRT. In this category of patients, EBB offered adequate symptomatic relief in a substantial proportion of patients [3,9,12,23-25,27,32]. Later, EBB was also combined with XRT as primary treatment [2,6,8,30]. Speiser and co-workers [27] reported on a prospective study among 342 patients with endobronchial tumours treated by the combination of XRT (30 to 60 Gy) and concomitant EBB during week 1, 3 and 5. The results achieved with this approach were quite remarkable, with response rates of 99% for haemoptysis, 85% for cough and 86% for dyspnea. In a retrospective study, Chang and coworkers [6] reported comparable results with the combination of XRT (20 to 70 Gy) and concomitant EBB (3 Â£ 7 Gy HDR) during week 2, 4 and 6. They observed response rates of 79% for cough, 95% for haemoptysis and 87% for dyspnea.\nMany patients with centrally localized lung cancer present with post-obstructive pneumonia or atelectasis. With XRT alone, the proportion of patients in whom a partial or complete re-expansion of collapsed lung has been achieved varies from 21 to 61% [7,19,29]. With the combination of EBB and XRT, much higher rates of reexpansion have been observed, varying from 67 to 99% [2,6,30].\nThese results suggest that with the combination of XRT and EBB, post-obstructive features such as pneumonitis and atelectasis are likely to be treated more adequately compared to XRT alone. This could also account for the higher response rates for those respiratory symptoms associated with post-obstructive features, in particular, for dyspnea.\nHowever, the definitions used for response of symptoms, re-expansion of collapsed lung, and the methods used to assess these responses, differed widely between the aforementioned studies. Moreover, the inclusion criteria of these studies differed widely and no randomized studies have been published investigating the additional value on palliation of respiratory symptoms of EBB plus XRT versus XRT alone. Therefore, the additional value of EBB concomitantly with XRT is not yet well defined.\nThis prospective randomized phase III study was conducted to test two specific hypotheses. Firstly, we expected that among patients with centrally localized Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the addition of concomitant EBB during XRT would result in higher rates of re-expansion of post-obstructive infiltration/atelectasis and/or higher rates of prevention of these post-obstructive features. Secondly, we expected that these higher rates of re-expansion would result in higher levels of palliation of respiratory symptoms, in particular for dyspnea and cough, as well as in greater levels of improvement in quality of life (QoL). Furthermore, the higher dose that can be administered with EBB to the endobronchialobstructing tumour may lead to higher a degree of desobstruction and an additional beneficial effect on respiratory symptoms, even in the absence of an atelectasis.",

For external irradiation, two fractionation schedules were allowed, i.e. a radical fractionation schedule (60 Gy) or a palliative fractionation schedule (30 Gy).\nPatients with a WHO performance status 3, supraclavicular lymph node metastases and/or distant metastases with symptoms related to intrathoracic tumour, were considered to have the worst prognosis and were selected for the palliative fractionation schedule.\nPatients with stage I or II disease (UICC 1992) with a tumour diameter . 4 cm or stage IIIa and stage IIIb disease (UICC 1992) without supraclavicular lymph node metastases and a WHO performance # 2 were considered to have an intermediate prognosis and were selected for the radical fractionation schedule.\nFor both fractionation schedules, the target volume included the primary tumour and enlarged mediastinal and supraclavicular lymph nodes with a margin of 2 cm, as well as the mediastinal lymph node areas on both sides. For patients treated according to the palliative schedule, the target volume was irradiated with 3 Gy per fraction (four times a week) up to a total dose of 30 Gy (100%) without correction for lung tissue density. For patients treated according to the radical schedule, the aforementioned target volume was treated with fraction doses of 2.25 Gy (four times a week) to a total dose of 45 Gy, followed by a boost up to 60 Gy, using fraction doses of 2.5 Gy (four times a week) on the gross tumour volume with a 1 cm margin. When the radical schedule was used, correction was made for lung tissue density (0.3). In case of the presence of atelectasis, resulting in difficulties in distinguishing tumour from collapsed lung, all abnormalities were included in the target volume. Patients allocated to\ntreatment arm 2 received an additional two fractions of 7.5 Gy with high dose rate (HDR) EBB in weeks 1 and 2. The choice of the external fractionation schedule was left to the decision of the treating physician. Stratification was applied for the external fractionation schedule (palliative; radical), stage (stage I, II; stage IIIa, IIIb) and the participating centre (Radiotherapeutisch Instituut Limburg, Heerlen and Maastricht; Verbeeten Instituut, Tilburg; The Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital, Amsterdam).",

When the distal border of the tumour was not visible by bronchoscopy, the distal extension was estimated using CT scan of the thorax. Then, the catheter was connected to the HDR-microselectron (Nucletron, Leersum, The Netherlands) and treatment was performed using an Iridium 192 stepping source, using a stepping size of 2.5 or 5 mm. All doses used were prescribed on a distance of 1 cm perpendicularly to the central axis of the source. In all patients, a single catheter was used and dose optimization was not performed. EBB and XRT were not administered on the same day. Following treatment, the patients were observed and discharged after a few hours.",

In case of major changes due to re-expansion of collapsed lung, a new planning-CT scan was made and the treatment plan was adjusted.\nDefinitive re-expansion of atelectasis or post-obstructive\npneumonia was assessed by means of chest radiographs, CT scan of the chest and by changes in the inspiratory vital capacity (IVC), performed 2 to 6 weeks after the end of the entire course of treatment.",

      "content": "Randomization was carried out centrally by the Comprehensive Cancer Centre Limburg in Maastricht, the Netherlands. For randomisation, a permuted block design was used. Patients were stratified by institution, stage (I-II vs. III) and external fractionation schedule (radical vs. palliative).\nThe level of palliation of symptoms and QoL was evaluated in two different ways. First, short-term levels of palliation were examined by a subject-specific analysis, assessing response for each symptom and QoL domain in all patients individually. The response rate of symptoms is often calculated only over the subset of patients having a specific symptom at baseline and at least one follow-up assessment. When the follow-up score for a symptom is lower than that reported at baseline, the patient is considered palliated. Conversely, when the follow-up score is higher, the patient is considered to have deteriorated. In the current study we employed an alternative definition of palliation, derived from the proposal of Stephens and co-workers [31], which also takes into account patients with no or mild symptoms at baseline and those who died before the first followup assessment. To assess the response rate for symptoms, each symptom scale was first divided into four categories. For the single-item scales (cough, haemoptysis, pain arm/shoulder, pain chest wall and appetite loss), four ranges of scores were defined: 1 GLYPH<136> nil, 2 GLYPH<136> mild, 3 GLYPH<136> moderate and 4 GLYPH<136> severe. For the multi-item scales (dyspnea and fatigue), four ranges of scores were defined as well, based on the converted score ranging from 0 to 100: 0 GLYPH<136> nil, 1 to 34 GLYPH<136> mild, 35 to 67 GLYPH<136> moderate and 68 to 100 GLYPH<136> severe.\nThe criteria used to define palliation of symptoms, functioning scales and global QoL are described earlier [14] and are outlined in appendix 1 and 2.\nDifferences in response rates were tested for statistical significance with a chi-square test.\nSecondly, long term results were evaluated by a groupbased analysis, comparing changes in mean scores for the two treatment groups at each time point. Differences between the two arms were tested for statistical significance with a repeated measurement ANOVA using a mixed effect modelling procedure, SAS Proc Mixed. In contrast to a 'complete cases analysis', the mixed effect modelling retains in the analysis patients who dropout during followup. Trends over time for dropouts and complete cases are estimated under the assumption that all patients within the same group have the same change pattern over time. SAS Proc Mixed uses the method of restricted maximum likelihood to estimate the parameters of the model. F-tests are used for testing main effects of group and time, and an interaction effect of group Â£ time.\nSurvival curves were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method. The log rank test was used to test the statistical significance of differences between survival curves.\nThe primary endpoint of the study was the response rate of dyspnea, which was the symptom, considered to benefit most from the addition of EBB. The secondary endpoints were re-expansion of atelectasis, survival and complications. The other respiratory symptoms and QoL dimensions were evaluated on an exploratory basis. Assuming that the rate of palliation of dyspnea would increase from 50 to 75%, a total number of 160 patients was necessary with a twosided type I error of 0.05 and a power of 80%. The analysis was performed on all eligible patients according to the intent-to-treat principle.\nBefore the study started, there was some concern regarding a possible increase of the incidence of massive haemoptysis in the experimental arm. Because of the relatively low incidence of massive haemoptysis, a stopping rule based on numbers was considered inappropriate. Therefore, an independent committee was installed. After each severe complication, including massive haemoptysis of fistulae, this committee was informed by the study coordinator regarding the total number of patients included in both arms at that time, the total number of severe complications in each arm and a detailed medical history of every patient with this complication. Based on this information, the committee was authorized to stop the study.",

The causes of death are shown in Table 5. No significant differences were observed between the two treatment groups. In particular, six patients treated with XRT died of massive haemoptysis (13%) compared to seven patients treated with XRT and EBB (15%). One of these patients who died from massive haemoptysis and who was treated with XRT and EBB, also developed a broncho-esofageal fistula 2 weeks before massive lung bleeding.

      "content": "In the present study, the additional value of early concomitant EBB during XRT was investigated with a prospective randomized design. The two treatment groups were well balanced concerning pre-treatment characteristics. The first hypothesis to be tested was whether the addition of EBB to XRT offered better rates of re-expansion of collapsed lung. Both methods used to evaluate this, i.e. radiological re-expansion and improvement of the inspiratory vital capacity showed that the level of improvement was significantly higher when XRT was combined with EBB\nNote: A positive difference score represents an increase negative score decrease of symptoms. and\n(straight line) Progression of atelectasis\n(straight line) No change of atelectasis\n(dotted line) Partial re-expansion\n(dotted line) Complete re-expansion\nNote: positive difference score represents an increase and negative score decrease of symptoms\nas compared to XRT alone. It has to be stressed that no significant difference between the two arms was observed with respect to response of dyspnea, which was one of the primary endpoints of the study. However, a significantly greater degree of improvement regarding the mean values of dyspnea was achieved by the addition of concomitant EBB during XRT. This beneficial effect lasted for only 6 weeks and disappeared after 3 months. Furthermore, the beneficial effect on dyspnea did not translate into an improvement in functioning or global QoL. There has been some concern that improving ventilation areas that are not perfused because of malignant infiltration of the pulmonary vessels could increase the physiological dead space and lead to worsening of dyspnea. However, in the present study, patients with a complete re-expansion showed the best improvement in the level of palliation of dyspnea, and no difference was noted between those with a partial re-expansion and no change of collapsed lung. Goldman and co-workers [10] investigated physiological changes among patients treated with HDR EBB for major airway occlusion by malignant diseases. They observed a significant increase in fractional ventilation and perfusion\nfor the affected lung and no worsening of shortness of breath in case of re-expansion. These findings suggest that reexpansion of collapsed lung does not necessarily lead to worsening of dyspnea, and may actually improve dyspnea in case of a complete re-expansion. A striking finding was that the difference in palliation of dyspnea in favour of the patients randomized for XRT and EBB was only observed in the subset of patients with a tumour obstructing the main bronchus, and not in the patients with obstructing tumours in the lobar bronchus. This finding is supported by the report of Goldman and co-workers [10]. They found that patients with tumours occluding a main bronchus had greater improvement in physiological indices, including spirometric indices, fractional ventilation and perfusion, and 5 min walking distance, than those who had a tumour in a lobar bronchus. In the latter group, no improvement was observed for any of the physiological indices mentioned. One explanation for this finding could be that re-expansion of an entire lung results in a relatively higher increase of the total lung volume compared to re-expansion of a lobe. Second, the failure to observe symptomatic improvement among patients with lesions located in the more distal airway segments may also be due to radiation damage arising from the use of an uniform dose prescription along the entire length of the target. The results of some studies support dosing in accordance with the bronchial diameter [14]. It has to be emphasized that no definitive conclusions can be drawn from this subset analysis. However, these findings stress the need for further prospective evaluation in the group of patients with obstructing endobronchial tumour in the main bronchus.\nIn the present study, a single catheter with a diameter of 3 mm was used in all patients. No centering devices and/or dose optimization were used. Recent literature shows [28] that applicators are commonly eccentrically located at the carina level which could lead to a less adequate dose distribution in the tumour volume [15]. One could argue that the brachytherapy technique as applied in the present study accounts for the short duration of palliation observed. It has to be stressed that we did not intend to include the entire gross tumour volume into the brachytherapy volume, but to\ndeliver a supplemental radiation dose to the endobronchial tumour in order to achieve higher response rate of endobronchial tumour obstruction and post-obstructive features including pneumonitis and atelectasis with an additional beneficial effect on pulmonary symptoms. Taken into account the extension of most tumours at the time of brachytherapy (day 1 and 8), the consequences of using a centering device regarding the dose distribution in the tumour volume would have been relatively small. Furthermore, even in case of a more adequate dose distribution in the tumour volume, it remains uncertain if that would have resulted in better palliation of pulmonary symptoms. In one of our recent publications no clear association was found between objective tumour response and palliation of most pulmonary symptoms [16].\nAlthough, in the analysis comparing mean scores a significant difference between the two treatment arms was observed regarding dyspnea, no such difference was noted in the analysis comparing response rates for dyspnea. This apparent inconsistency could be explained by the fact that 'improvement' of a symptom was defined as a decrease on two consecutive assessments in the first 3 months after therapy. The same holds for the definition of 'control' and 'prevention'. As the beneficial effect in favor of EBB and XRT tended to disappear at 3 months, few patients experienced a response on at least two consecutive assessments.\nOne of the shortcomings of the current study is that it ended prematurely due to a decreasing accrual of patients. The main reason for this decreasing accrual was the increasing use of chemotherapy, which is now currently used in the majority of patients with locally advanced Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with prior or planned chemotherapy were ineligible for the current study. The limited number of patients entered in the present study raises the question whether there was sufficient power to detect differences if they were actually there (i.e. protecting against type II errors).\nMassive haemoptysis has frequently been described as a major complication after EBB. The results of a previous analysis indicated that the relatively high incidence of massive haemoptysis observed among patients treated with EBB was probably due to selection of patients and not to EBB itself [17]. In that study, a dramatic increase in the incidence of massive haemoptysis was only observed among those patients treated with XRT in combination with a single fraction of 15 Gy. The incidence of massive haemoptysis of those treated with XRT and EBB with two fraction of 7.5 Gy was similar to that observed in the group of patients treated with XRT alone but who would have been eligible for EBB. In the current prospective randomized study, the findings of the retrospective study were confirmed; no difference was noted in the incidence of massive haemoptysis between the two treatment arms. Huber and co-workers reported on the results of another prospective study in which patients were randomized between XRT (60 Gy) and XRT (60 Gy) and two session of EBB with 4.8 Gy applied 1 week before and 3 weeks after\ncompletion of XRT. It has to be emphasized that in only 50% of the patients in their study actually received the 2nd planned brachytherapy. The incidence of massive haemoptysis was 15.4% after XRT alone and 20.8% after XRT plus EBB; a difference which was not statistically significant [15]. These findings indicate that the addition of EBB to XRT does not lead to an increase of massive haemoptysis.\nThe survival rate in the group of patients randomized to receive XRT and EBB was not significantly different from those randomized to XRT alone, although, the curves diverged after 6 months. We could not find an explanation for this finding. The incidence of major complications was similar and the same holds for the other causes of death.\nIn conclusion, concomitant EBB during XRT provides higher response rates for re-expansion of collapsed lung compared to XRT alone. A temporary but significant higher level of palliation of dyspnea was observed with additional EBB. However, the findings suggest that this beneficial effect of additional EBB is confined to the group of patients with obstructing tumours of the main bronchus. We believe that the results of this study do not support the addition of endobronchial brachytherapy to external radiotherapy as standard approach. In individual cases, brachytherapy added to external irradiation could be considered in those patients suffering from severe dyspnea due to endobronchial tumour obstruction in the main bronchus.",
