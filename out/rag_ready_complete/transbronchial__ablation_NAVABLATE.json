    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Image-guided thermal ablation is a minimally invasive local therapy for lung malignancies. NAVABLATE characterized the safety and performance of transbronchial microwave ablation (MWA) in the lung. METHODS: The prospective, single-arm, 2-center NAVABLATE study (NCT03569111) evaluated transbronchial MWA in patients with histologically confirmed lung malignancies ≤30 mm in maximum diameter who were not candidates for, or who declined, both surgery and stereotactic body radiation therapy. Ablation of 1 nodule was allowed per subject. The nodule was reached with electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy. Cone-beam computed tomography was used to verify the ablation catheter position and to evaluate the ablation zone postprocedure. The primary end point was composite adverse events related to the transbronchial MWA device through 1-month follow-up. Secondary end points included technical success (nodule reached and ablated according to the study protocol) and technique efficacy (satisfactory ablation based on 1-month follow-up imaging). RESULTS: Thirty subjects (30 nodules; 66.7% primary lung, 33.3% oligometastatic) were enrolled from February 2019 to September 2020. The pre-procedure median nodule size was 12.5 mm (range 5 to 27 mm). Procedure-day technical success was 100% (30/30), with a mean ablative margin of 9.9±2.7 mm. One-month imaging showed 100% (30/30) technique efficacy. The composite adverse event rate related to the transbronchial MWA device through 1-month follow-up was 3.3% (1 subject, mild hemoptysis). No deaths or pneumothoraces occurred. Four subjects (13.3%) experienced grade 3 complications; none had grade 4 or 5. CONCLUSION: Transbronchial microwave ablation is an alternative treatment modality for malignant lung nodules ≤30 mm. There were no deaths or pneumothorax. In all, 13.3% of patients developed grade 3 or above complications.",

Transbronchial ablation may be associated with less pain than a percutaneous approach, more preserved lung function than surgery, and unlike SBRT, allows for repeated ablations in the event of local recurrence. 12 The transbronchial approach also provides the ability to diagnose, stage with endobronchial ultrasound, and treat all in the same minimally invasive procedure based on current data. Several single-center retrospective studies and case reports have been published describing the use of transbronchial MWA for the local treatment of primary and metastatic tumors in the lung. 9,11,13,14 The current paper is the largest prospective, multicenter evaluation of transbronchial microwave ablation in the lung.",

The ablation device uses a saline-cooled ablation antenna with wavelength-controlled,\n/uniFB01 eld-based technology with the intent to deliver microwave energy in a spherical ablation zone.\nPatients ≥ 18 years of age with a histologically con /uniFB01 rmed malignant pulmonary nodule, ≤ 30 mm in maximum diameter, and over 5 mm from the pleura or /uniFB01 ssure were eligible for enrollment. The study eligibility criteria required that subjects were not candidates for either lung surgery or SBRT or declined both of those treatments. All cases were reviewed by each institution ' s multi-disciplinary board to determine whether or not they were candidates for surgery or SBRT. The speci /uniFB01 c reasons for subjects declining or not being candidates for surgery and SBRT were not collected in this study, but examples include pulmonary /uniFB01 brosis, previous lung radiotherapy, patients unable to lie still and /uniFB02 at for the duration of treatment, patients not ful /uniFB01 lling the inclusion criteria for funded SBRT in the UK National Health Service, and patient preference of undergoing a single procedure instead of attending multiple sessions of SBRT. Subjects had not consented for the collection of racial or ethnic origin data; therefore, this data was not collected. In addition, nodules abutting the main bronchus, main pulmonary vasculature, esophagus, or trachea, and patients currently diagnosed with GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) Stage IV chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) were excluded. If a patient had multiple nodules, only 1 was ablated in the study. Tissue diagnosis must have been obtained before the procedure or concurrently through ENB-guided biopsy during the index episode; however, malignancy must be con /uniFB01 rmed before ablation. Both primary lung cancer and oligometastatic malignant nodules were included.",

A CBCT scan could be conducted to identify the target and recon /uniFB01 rm nodule eligibility criteria. Navigation to the target was conducted using the superDimension navigation system version 7 (Medtronic) as previously described. 11 Once localized, the CrossCountry transbronchial access tool could be used at the investigator ' s discretion to aid in creating a\n|\npathway through the nodule to obtain an optimal position for ablation. If necessary, a biopsy sample could also be obtained at this time. Following target access, the ablation catheter was placed inside the extended working channel and was unsheathed inside or alongside the target nodule. Correct positioning was veri /uniFB01 ed using CBCT. The required power and time settings were determined from the product instruction for use, correlating power and time to the anticipated size of the ablation zone, to select an appropriately sized ablation zone that encompasses the nodule and a planned margin. The nodule was ablated. A CBCT scan at 10 minutes postablation was used to evaluate the ablation zone, and bracketed ablations were conducted as needed to achieve an adequate margin on all edges. Additional CBCT spins were utilized throughout the procedure as needed at the discretion of the operator. One-month follow-up imaging was obtained using conventional CT scans, along with clinical follow-up in all subjects. Example imaging at the described timepoints are presented in Fig. 1.",

Twenty-two subjects (73.3%) required only 1 ablation, 7 subjects (23.3%) required 2 overlapping ablation zones, and 1 subject (3.3%) required 3 ablation zones to fully cover the single target nodule with adequate margins. The mean number of CBCT spins was 11.1 ± 5.4 (range 5 to 29). The median air kerma radiation dose for CBCT was 388.6 mGy (range 57.0 to 2425.8 mGy). The median bronchoscopy procedure time measured by the insertion and removal\n|\nof the bronchoscope (inclusive of navigation, positioning, biopsy if applicable, and ablation) was 123 minutes, with a range of 54 to 247 minutes.\nIn post hoc analyses, we did not observe any consistent effects of learning curve, inclusion of concurrent biopsy, nodule size, lobe location, or the use of a positioning tool on the overall procedure time. The total procedure time was lower in cases with a single ablation (median 105.5 min) versus bracketed ablations (169.5 min).\nThe ablation power was set to 100 Watts (W) for most procedures (37/39), while 2 procedures used 75 W power. The ablation times were most commonly 10 minutes (21/39; 53.8%) or 7 minutes (8/39; 20.5%); the average ablation time was 8.1 ± 2.3 minutes (range 3.5 to 10 min).\nNeedle puncture was used to access the lesion in 19 cases, including 18 using the transbronchial access tool and 1 using both the CrossCountry\ntool and a needle (Arcpoint pulmonary needle, Medtronic). Following positioning, the distal end of the ablation catheter was within the nodule or adjacent to the nodule in all cases.

The composite rate of major complications in NAVABLATE (13.3%) is similar to the pooled major complication rates reported in the meta-analyses of percutaneous thermal ablation by Jiang et al (11.5%), 6 Li et al (6%), 25 and Lyons et al (range 7% to 33%) 26 and those reported for SBRT by Devpura et al (5.5%), 27 Timmerman et al (16.4%), 28 and Nyman et al (14.6%). 29 Based on the data in NAVABLATE, transbronchial MWA has a lower pneumothorax rate than percutaneous thermal ablation and a similar adverse event rate to SBRT.\nData are presented as n/N (%) [n events]\nGrade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated.\nGrade 2: Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living.\nGrade 3: Severe or medically signi /uniFB01 cant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self-care activities of daily living.\n§The adverse event was self-limiting and occurred during the inspiratory breath hold for CBCT.\n‖\nOther study devices may include, but are not limited to, the navigation system, the locatable guide, the extended working channel, transbronchial access\ntools and other endoscopic tools. There were no serious adverse events related to the Emprint Ablation Catheter Kit with Thermosphere Technology.\n¶A total of 9 serious adverse events (all rated as CTCAE Grade 3) related to the study procedure or other study devices occurred in 4 subjects.\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) indicates chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; CT, computed tomography; CTCAE, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.",

      "content": "*Complete ablation as evidenced by 1-month imaging.\n|\nThe median total bronchoscopy procedure time in NAVABLATE was 123 minutes, ranging from 54 to 247 minutes. Of note, this total procedure time was inclusive of navigation, positioning, biopsy frozen section histologic con /uniFB01 rmation, and ablation. Time navigating and positioning was a median of 52 minutes, and time actively ablating was a median of 10 minutes per ablation. There were 3 cases with a procedure time greater than 200 minutes, all of which required 2 ablations and an increased number of CBCT spins due to dif /uniFB01 -culty in navigation and positioning. We found no effects of the learning curve, inclusion of concurrent biopsy, nodule size, lobe location, or the use of a positioning tool on the overall procedure time. However, the NAVABLATE sample size was too small to support meaningful multivariate analyses.\nThe subjects enrolled in NAVABLATE included 2/3 with primary lung cancer and 1/3 with oligometastatic disease (primarily colorectal). This is similar to the proportions observed in a meta-analysis of 34 studies evaluating percutaneous thermal ablation. 6 While surgical resection is the preferred treatment modality for localized lung nodules, patients with primary lung cancer in NAVABLATE had poorer lung function than those with metastatic lesions, including 50% with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and prior lung surgery in 45%. While over half (53%, 16/30) of NAVABLATEsubjects were candidates for surgery and/or SBRT, 10/30 declined both of those procedures, and 6/30 declined the one procedure for which they were eligible. Thus, thermal ablation was an acceptable alternative treatment for these patients. Furthermore, a biopsy was conducted in the same setting (just before the ablation procedure) in one-third of subjects, suggesting that a single stage procedure approach of concurrent biopsy and treatment is feasible. Staging by endobronchial ultrasound is also possible in the same procedure.",
