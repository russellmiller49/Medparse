      "content": "Currently, surgical resection is an irreplaceable curative treatment for lung cancer. Although advanced surgical techniques and managements have improved the survival rate and reduced a variety of postoperative complications, the generally poor prognosis remains a large challenge to thoracic surgeons, particularly in some high-risk patients, such as those undergoing pneumonectomy for advanced lung cancer (1 -3). Since the 1990s, thoracic surgeons have increasingly paid attention to neoadjuvant therapy (NT) for improving the resectability. NT can reduce or eliminate the micro-metastasis especially in patients with advanced lung cancer (4,5). Recent systematic reviews have integrated the previously published randomized control trials (RCTs) and concluded that NT can significantly benefit the survival outcomes of operable patients (4 -6). However, the impact of NT on intraoperative and postoperative complications still remains a debate (7,8).\nAmong the major fatal complications causing decreased survival rate, bronchopleural fistula (BPF) still troubles thoracic surgeons because of the devastating leakage from airways into pleural space (9,10). Although the incidence of BPF has been largely decreased during the last few decades, the mortality caused by its adverse effects remains high (18 -50%) (9). Surgical procedures, such as operative modes and bronchial stump closure, are generally accepted as the leading causes of postoperative BPF (11,12). As an important preoperative parameter, NT has been extensively evaluated in many relevant studies addressing the risk factors of BPF. However, the clinical outcomes associated with NT vary hugely, and a consensus has not been reached on the detailed association between NT and BPF risk until now (9,13).\nRecently, the statistical methods of evidence-based medicine (EBM) which are represented by meta-analyses, have been increasingly applied in clinical practice to draw relatively global conclusions by quantitatively integrating the appropriate data from homogeneous studies (4 -6,14). The current evidences revealing the effects of NT on BPF risk have not yet been systematically reviewed. Therefore, we conducted this systematic meta-analysis to determine the association between NT and risk of BPF in patients undergoing lung cancer surgery.",

      "content": "According to the previously published reports, the incidence of BPF was generally far lower than 20% (9). Therefore, no significant difference was observed between OR and Relative risk (RR), and the risk of overestimating the impact of NT on BPF development could be largely avoided (17). In this meta-analysis, we applied the Odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI as the appropriate summarized statistics. In general, Odds ratio (OR) with 95% CI could be directly extracted from the published statistical results, Odds ratio (or) extrapolated by demographic data if no statistic was reported. Moreover, if RRs or HRs were reported in original studies, they could be directly considered as ORs and incorporated into our meta-analysis (17). Remarkably, NT could be indicated as an independent risk factor of BPF if the pooled Odds ratio (OR) with 95%CI appeared >1.\nQ -test and I 2 statistic were commonly applied to estimate the level of heterogeneity within this meta-analysis. On the one hand, low heterogeneity was defined as I 2 < 40% and P > 0.1, determining the standard fixed-effect model (Mantel -Haenszel method) to integrate the ORs. On the other hand, if significant heterogeneity was revealed by I 2 ≥ 40% or P ≤ 0.1, the random-effect model (DerSimonian and Laird method) would be used for quantitative synthesis (18). Additionally, we regarded I 2 statistic as the major indicator for heterogeneity estimations because it had been proved as an effective method to quantify the inconsistency across studies (17).\nThen, we conducted sensitivity analysis to evaluate the stability of this meta-analysis after identifying the possible origins of significant heterogeneity. The study contributing to the significant heterogeneity would be removed and a repeated meta-analysis of the remaining studies would be performed for adjustments. The strong stability of our meta-analysis would be confirmed if no substantial varies were\nobserved between the adjusted summarized outcomes and primary summarized outcomes (19).\nBoth Begg ' s test and Egger ' s test were used to detect the publication bias in this meta-analysis. Its presence could be suggested by the symmetry of funnel plot conducted by Begg ' s test, in which log ORs were plotted against their corresponding standard errors. Meanwhile, we could also confirm the significant bias if Egger ' s P value < 0.05 (20).\nFinally, all of the above statistical analyses were accomplished by STATA 12.0 (STATA Corporation, College Station, TX, USA).",

All of these studies belong to retrospective observational studies, and were published from 1992 to 2014 (21 -50).\nThey enrolled a total of 14 912 patients undergoing lung cancer resections from 1979 to 2012, and non-small cell lung cancer (Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)) accounted for ∼ 99.8% of all cases (14 884/14 912). Asian patients provided 77.2% of the enrolled samples (11 510/14 912) (23,30,31,34,35,40,42,45,46,49,50), including 6923 cases from China (31,35), 4347 cases from Japan (23,30,34,40,42,49,50), 177 cases from Turkey (45) and 63 cases from Korea (46). The other 3402 patients (3402/14 912, ratio = 22.8%) were from European and North American countries and reported in 19 studies (21,22, 24 -29,32,33,36 -39,41,43,44,47,48). Postoperative BPF was diagnosed in 354 patients by endoscopic inspection and clinical manifestation. Therefore, the incidence of BPF after lung cancer surgery was 2.4% (354/14 912) in this systematic review. NC was generally applied in most of the included studies. Twelve studies independently analyzed the effects of NC (21,26,34,35,37,38,42,44 -47,50), another 11 studies analyzed the effects of neoadjuvant chemo-radiation (NCR) (24,27 -29,32,33,39 -41,44,49), and another four studies investigated the association between NR and BPF risk (23,46,48,50). Besides, the remaining studies (22,25,30,31,36,43) enrolled both NC cases and NRcases but analyzed them together, without providing any extractable detail on each strategy. The operations performed on lung cancer patients included pneumonectomy (21,22,25,26,29 -31,33,34,36 -40,43 -48), lobectomy (32,42) and bronchoplasty (24,27,28,41).

The other 17 included studies (22,23,25,30,31,33 -36,40,42,43,46 -50) classified 12 919 patients (12 919/14 912, ratio = 86.6%) by BPF occurrence, and evaluated the risk factors of BPF based on the patients with BPF and without BPF (BPF vs. non-BPF) (Table 2). Furthermore, more than half of these 17 studies (22,23,30,31,35,40,42,43,47) performed both univariate analysis and multivariate analysis to comprehensively identify the independent factors of BPF.

All of them indicated that NT was an independent factor predisposing to postoperative BPF (Table 3 and Fig. 3A).\nConsidering the NT strategies, there were six studies (22,25,30,31,36,43) excluded because no relevant detail of NT was reported in these studies. Pooled analyses suggested that NR (Odds ratio (OR): 3.914; 95%CI: 1.401 -10.935; P = 0.009) (23,46,48,50) and NCR (Odds ratio (OR): 2.533; 95%CI: 1.353 -4.741; P = 0.004) (24,27 -29,32,33,39 -41,44,49) were both significantly associated with the increased risk of BPF, with low heterogeneity (Table 3 and Fig. 3B). The summarized outcomes integrating 12 available studies (21,26,34,35,37,38,42,44 -47,50) revealed the higher frequency of BPF occurred in patients treated with NC compared with those without NC (Odds ratio (OR): 1.857; 95%CI: 0.881 -3.911).

      "title": "Discussion",
      "content": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to systematically evaluate the association between NT and risk of BPF in patients undergoing lung cancer surgery. In our meta-analysis, we quantitatively integrated the clinical data from the studies published since the 1990s when NT was already widely applied in a proper way (29). We enrolled 14 912 surgical patients from 30 included studies, and Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounted for almost all of the enrolled cases (14 884/ 14 912, ratio = 99.8%). The other cases were small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cases (28/14 912, ratio = 0.2%) but the details of BPF development in these cases were not available. Therefore, this meta-analysis could be approximately regarded as the evaluation of the association\nbetween NT and risk of BPF after Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) resections. We also discovered that no high-quality RCT or prospective study reported the effects of NT on BPF risk, which may be because of some inherent limitations in this addressed issue.\nThe discussion on safe applications of NT has never been stopped. According to the latest systematic reviews, NT is generally considered as an essential strategy in multidisciplinary treatments for lung cancer patients to improve the resectability and survival rate (4 -6). However, some clinical reports have also mentioned the potential adverse effects of NT on bronchial stump healing after lung cancer surgery (57). Given such concern, we propose that applying EBM methods to a larger number of pooled evidences may better clarify the impact of NT on BPF development. The main issue to be addressed is whether the association between NT and BPF risk is statistically reliable. Therefore, we quantitatively integrated the currently available evidences, which led to the conclusion that NT was an independent risk factor of BPF occurrence after lung cancer surgery. However, we discovered the remarkable high inconsistency among the included studies ( I 2 = 49.4%, P = 0.001), suggesting the significant heterogeneity of pooled outcomes.\nThe earliest relevant multivariate analysis enrolling >1000 patients was reported by Asamura et al. (23) in 1992. It revealed that NR was a significant risk factor of BPF. This conclusion was supported by Uramoto et al. (50) after analyzing 1424 surgical patients. Both NR and NC were identified to be significantly associated with BPF formation after lung cancer surgery in this study. On the basis of NT, Hu et al. (31) even designed an effective clinical risk model to evaluate the development of BPF. However, the significant relationship between NT and risk of BPF was not shown in most of the included studies (21,24 -30,32,34 -40,44,46 -48), including the currently largest study which enrolled 6239 surgical patients from China (35). Refai et al. (44) proposed that adequately balanced comparison should be a prerequisite to demonstrate the impact of NT on surgical outcomes. They performed a case-matched analysis in 77 pairs of propensity score-matched patients and indicated that either NC or NCR was not significantly associated with the increased risk of BPF. However, too small sample size under balanced comparison might cause large negative effects on conducting statistically significant outcomes.\nTherefore, we performed detailed subgroup analyses to further dissect the heterogeneity. When stratifying the sources of ORs, the significant heterogeneity was revealed among the pooled OR results extrapolated by demographic data based on univariate analysis ( I 2 = 53.4%, P = 0.001) but not among the reported statistics from multivariate analysis ( I 2 = 0.0%, P = 0.493). One possible reason might be related to the bias risks from confounding factors. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression or Cox proportional hazards model is generally applied to eliminate the bias from other confounding factors in observational studies. In this meta-analysis, the majority of included studies just reported the demographic results instead of any statistic from multivariate analysis. Most confounding factors were not adequately adjusted and might increase the heterogeneity across the included studies. Besides, the validity of pooled outcomes in our meta-analysis might be attenuated by the negative effects of various confounders.\nThe major confounding factors in this meta-analysis, including operative modes, advanced stages and bronchial stump closure, should be seriously considered. It has been widely accepted that pneumonectomy can increase the risk of BPF compared with lesser pulmonary resections, particularly in right side (9,13). The subgroup analysis based on operative modes indicated the significant impact of NT on BPF risk in patients undergoing pneumonectomy, lobectomy and bronchoplasty, respectively. However, we could not further eliminate the\nB\nE\nbias caused by right pneumonectomy due to the scarcity of extractable details. Although NT has remarkable efficacies on treating advanced lung cancer, incomplete resection is still an important factor that cannot be ignored for the prognosis and risk of BPF in lung cancer patients (58). In this meta-analysis, all the included studies enrolled the patients with different stages but analyzed them together. We found a significant difference in the clinical stages between patients with NT and without NT in many included studies, which might result in some bias risks on the pooled outcomes. Unfortunately, we finally gave up the further analysis because no data of BPF occurrence in each lung cancer stage was reported in these studies.\nFor thoracic surgeons, the choices of bronchial closure and reinforcement can be mandated by some widely accepted factors of BPF, including the applications of NT. Recent EBM investigations have quantified the impact of bronchial stump coverage and closure on BPF development, but some controversial results still exist until now (11,12). One important reason is that thoracic surgeons usually make more efforts on buttressing the bronchial stumps in patients considered at high risk of BPF (including those treated with NT), resulting in an unbalanced comparison with patients at low risk of BPF. The varying degrees of baseline risks between groups of patients classified by NT application might bring large interference on pooling accurate outcomes (12).\nSimilarly, in our study, we were unable to effectively evaluate the bias caused by bronchial closure and reinforcement on BPF incidence between patients with NT and without NT because of the following\nthree reasons. First, researchers performed various bronchial closure methods across the different studies, and that could not be quantitatively analyzed. Second, additional buttress at the bronchial stump was generally performed in patients treated with NT rather than those without NT, which interfered the equal comparison. Third, few included studies provided the extractable details of bronchial closure and reinforcement in patients undergoing NT. Therefore, according to what Di Maio et al. (12) described, we speculated that the special bronchial stump reinforcement might slightly attenuate the impact of NT on BPF risk.\nIn the subgroup analysis stratified by NT strategies, one issue drawing our interest was that both NCR and NR significantly increased the risk of BPF but NC did not. It suggested that the development of BPF was mainly driven by NCR and NR rather than NC itself, which was consistent with the discoveries from most of the included studies. As some reports indicated, the incidence of BPF even slightly decreased in patients treated with NC (35,37,38,44). However, the pooled OR for NC group appeared an obvious trend towards the increased risk of BPF (Odds ratio (OR): 1.857; 95%CI: 0.881 -3.911; P = 0.104). Two studies with nearly 1000 surgical patients also demonstrated the significant relationship between NC and occurrence of BPF (42,45). Therefore, the actual effects of NC on risk of BPF need further affirmations and modifications in the future studies based on a larger sample size.\nThe universally acknowledged mechanisms underlying BPF formation induced by NCR or NR contain the following two perspectives. On the one hand, anti-cancer agents can cause some injuries on vascular walls, resulting in the insufficiency of bronchial stump or anastomosis. Yamamoto et al. (59) firstly investigated the detailed association between NT and bronchial mucosal blood flow (BMBF), and discovered that NCR significantly reduced the BMBF but NC did not. Thus, NCR may be significantly associated with the increased risk of bronchial complications including BPF. On the other hand, vary degrees of fibrosis progression are commonly developed at the bronchial stump after NT intervention, especially in patients receiving NCR or NR (32). An experiment conducted by Inui et al. (60) clarified this mechanism during the early period after giving NR in mongrel dogs. In subsequent clinical reports, the fibrosis induced by a series of inflammatory reactions at the bronchial stumps was also identified in patients with NCR or NR, resulting in the unimpeded BMBF (57,61). Therefore, the lack of regional BMBF directly predisposes to the insufficient bronchial stump or anastomosis (59,60).\nFurthermore, higher dose of NR may also be an independent risk factor of BPF (51). However, we failed to further investigate the dose responses of NR because continuous variables were not considered in this meta-analysis. In addition, the scarcity of available data about NR doses in the current studies also hugely reduced the feasibility of quantitative integrations. Therefore, a critical dose of NR accurately predicting the occurrence of BPF was not identified, resulting in slightly negative effects on the integrality of our meta-analysis.",

First, integrating the data mainly originated from univariate analysis might cause some adverse effects on the validity of our meta-analysis, because the bias risks from some confounding factors were insufficiently eliminated. Second, no RCTs or prospective studies were available for our meta-analysis. Perhaps it might be related to some inherent limitations of the addressed issue itself. Third, we were unable to further identify the association between\ndose responses of NR and risk of BPF in this meta-analysis due to the scarcity of available data. Four, the current evidences came from many countries. Thus, inevitable variability in clinical settings of different countries should be judiciously considered. Last, only the literatures published in English language were considered for eligibility of this meta-analysis. We would identify more additional literatures if removing the language limitation.",

The further analysis clarifies both NCR and NR are independent risk factors of BPF in patients undergoing lung cancer surgery. NC does not significantly increase the risk of postoperative BPF but shows a tendency of higher BPF incidence. Some confounding factors may weaken the accuracy of pooled outcomes. The association between NR doses and BPF development remains a debate. Therefore, the updated high-quality studies can help to further confirm and enrich our discoveries in the future.",
