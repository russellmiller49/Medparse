The incidence of pleural infection continues to\nrise, with an annual incidence of z 80,000 in the United States and United Kingdom (1). It is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality as well as increased hospital\ncosts despite advances in medical diagnostic and therapeutic strategies (1 -3). The overall mortality of pleural infection approaches 20%, reaching more than 30% in\npatients over 65 years of age and immunocompromised patients (2, 4 -6).\nTreatment of pleural infection requires antibiotics and chest tube drainage of the pleural cavity (2). However, z 30% of patients experience dif /uniFB01 culty in draining /uniFB02 uid owing to loculations, septations, and increased viscosity of the pleural /uniFB02 uid, and z 20% will need a surgical intervention to adequately treat their pleural infection (7, 8).\nThe intrapleural therapy of combined tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and human recombinant deoxyribonuclease (DNase) for the management of pleural infection was shown to improve the chest radiographic appearance of infected effusion in MIST2 (Multicenter Intrapleural Sepsis Trial 2) as compared with either medications or placebo (8). However, this approach is expensive and requires a substantial hospital stay (10 -14 d) (8).\nMedical thoracoscopy (MT) is a minimally invasive procedure that can be used to treat pleural infection by improving clearance via mechanical lysis of adhesions and targeted drain placement. MT can also be used in patients who are not /uniFB01 t for general anesthesia because it can be performed using local anesthesia and moderate sedation. MT has been shown in observational studies to be safe and effective for the treatment of pleural infection (9 -12). However, there are currently no randomized controlled trials addressing the potential role of early MT versus intrapleural /uniFB01 brinolytic therapy (IPFT) in pleural infection.\nThe goal of this study was to compare the ef /uniFB01 cacy of early MT versus IPFT in patients with complicated parapneumonic effusion (CPPE) or pleural empyema.\nA portion of the work contained in this manuscript was previously presented as an oral presentation (13).",

      "title": "Discussion",
      "content": "VATS has been suggested as a surgical invasive approach to clear potentially infected material from the pleural space. In small randomized and nonrandomized prospective trials comparing VATS with intercostal drainage plus intrapleural streptokinase, VATS was associated with decreased hospital stays (19, 20). However, large cases series (21, 22) have shown that VATS is usually performed on younger\nindividuals with fewer comorbidities (i.e., highly selected patients) compared with the unselected population of patients (who are usually sicker, elderly, and have multiple comorbidities) with pleural infection seen in the /uniFB01 brinolytic studies (7, 8). Also, VATS or open thoracotomy has been used when patients fail to respond to IPFT. In this scenario, surgery allows adequate drainage of the pleural cavity and removal of the visceral pleural rind, thus improving lung restriction and compliance (2). This operation frequently leads to a higher complication rate (9 -40%) and 30-day mortality (2 -6%) (23, 24). Moreover, VATS was compared with intrapleural streptokinase. The intrapleural activity of endogenous PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor 1) in the pathogenesis of pleural infection is important because this mediator not only directly inhibits streptokinase but also contributes to the severity of loculation and poor outcomes with IPFT (25 -27).\nIPFT with tPA and DNase has been commonly used to treat patients with complicated pleural infection through a combination of chemical adhesion lysis, reduction of viscosity, bio /uniFB01 lm degradation, and possible lavage component -induced pleural /uniFB02 uid formation mediated by monocyte chemotactic protein (28).\nRecently, the use of MT for the management of pleural infection has gained interest (9, 10, 12). MT has the advantage of mechanically breaking loculations and septations in the pleural space, which will facilitate pleural /uniFB02 uid drainage, lavage, and targeted placement of the chest tube. In addition, pleural biopsies, which have been shown to increase diagnostic sensitivity for identifying the infectious agent, can be obtained. Furthermore, this minimally invasive procedure can be done under moderate sedation and local anesthesia, without the need for single lung ventilation\nor general anesthesia. Also, MT can be performed successfully by any operator (interventional pulmonologist or thoracic surgeon) who has completed dedicated training in the procedure.\nHowever, the MT modality has not previously been directly compared with IPFT. The results of this study suggest that MT might shorten hospital stays after the intervention as compared with IPFT. This is probably because the mechanical breakage of adhesions can expedite infected pleural effusion drainage as compared with chemical adhesion lysis through IPFT. Moreover, the overall length of hospital stays was shorter in the MT arm (3.5 d) than in the IPFT arm (6 d), which is clinically relevant as well.\nThe two interventions had similar treatment success without an increase in adverse events, con /uniFB01 rming previous /uniFB01 ndings regarding the safety and ef /uniFB01 cacy of both modalities. Furthermore, pleural biopsies increased the microbiology diagnostic yield by 12.5% in the MT arm, which con /uniFB01 rms the results of a recent published trial of pleural biopsy in pleural infection (29). This represents an additional advantage over IPFT alone, as pleural biopsies can accurately dictate the use of personalized rather than empiric antibiotics. It is also important to recognize that the antibiotics used in this study were given empirically for patients with pleural infection. However, once a pathogen was identi /uniFB01 ed or the patient ' s clinical condition improved, the antibiotics were modi /uniFB01 ed accordingly.\nThe rate of complications related to MT in our study was slightly lower than those reported in the literature (6.25% vs. 7 -17%) (9, 10, 12). This is because the primary outcome of the study was powered to detect the length of stay after hospitalization and not complications. Furthermore, only 16 patients were included in the MT arm, and the procedure was performed by an experienced practitioner.\nIn this study, we did not directly compare the average costs of IPFT and MT. However, four doses of IPFT cost approximately $12,032 USD, and MT (including 2 h of operating room time, sedation, and professional fees) costs approximately $9,682 USD. This could translate to lower overall costs for patients admitted with pleural infection.\nThere are several limitations to this study. The primary outcome of the study\nDefinition of abbreviations : IPFT = intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy; IQR = interquartile range; MT=medical thoracoscopy.\nwas the length of hospital stay after either intervention. This could potentially lead to a bias toward MT over IPFT. However, we de /uniFB01 ned treatment failure as ongoing infection with loculations at 48 hours after either intervention, and previous studies showed that a median of two to three doses was enough to achieve clinical success (18, 30, 31). Furthermore, all of the centers have dedicated interventional clinicians with experience in MT, and initially evaluate/ comanage all admitted patients with pleural effusion regardless of etiology; thus, the results are limited to centers with similar expertise. Our exclusion criteria were very selective. For instance, we only included patients with early-stage pleural infection based on chest US who were initially admitted or referred for evaluation concerning an infected pleural space and did not develop an effusion during their hospitalization. In addition, they were hemodynamically stable, able to provide written informed consent, and did not\nreceive IPFT, which contributed to the high success rate.\nThis could also explain the shorter postintervention shorter hospital stays in both arms as compared with previous studies, but would not affect the comparison between the groups. Also, the median age for patients undergoing MT was 65 years as compared with 58 years in the IPFT arm, which could have affected our results. However, this proves that MT can be safely offered and is effective in elderly patients without causing an increase in adverse events. In addition, leukocyte counts were lower in the MT arm than in the IPFT arm, which also could be a confounder. However, a previous study showed that patients with sepsis and lower leukocyte counts had more severe outcomes, including mortality, than those with higher counts (32). This was not evident in our study. Moreover, patients who were randomized to the MT arm had up to two ports placed and a 24-Fr chest tube introduced through the exiting port and positioned at the end of the procedure,\nwhereas patients in the IPFT arm had a small-bore chest tube was inserted, which might translate to an increased level of pain or discomfort postoperatively. We did not calculate objective pain scores because we assumed that it would not be clinically meaningful to compare them between the IPFT and MT arms. Finally, the study included only 32 patients; a larger sample size is probably needed to achieve greater precision.\nIn conclusion, MT is a minimally invasive procedure that is safe and effective for the treatment of early pleural infection in a select population, and might shorten hospital stays as compared with IPFT when performed in high-volume pleural centers by experienced interventional pulmonologists. A multicenter trial with a larger sample size is needed to con /uniFB01 rm our /uniFB01 ndings. n\nAuthor disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org.",
