    "abstract": "STUDY OBJECTIVE: We evaluated bronchoscopic tumor appearance and tumor location as determinants of response to high-dose rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) in patients with symptomatic unresectable bronchogenic carcinoma previously treated with external-beam irradiation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty patients with symptomatic endobronchial bronchogenic carcinoma who had previously completed external irradiation were divided into two groups based on whether the initial bronchoscopic appearance showed an endoluminal mass or submucosal infiltration/extrinsic compression. Furthermore, patients were also classified based on tumor location: central (trachea or mainstem bronchi) and peripheral (lobar or segmental bronchi). Patients underwent three treatments of 800 cGy intraluminal irradiation at 2-week intervals, with follow-up evaluation 4 weeks later. We evaluated response in tumor extent based on bronchoscopic and chest radiograph appearance, as well as symptoms with standardized scales. RESULTS: Fifteen of 24 patients who underwent follow-up bronchoscopy had reductions in the degree of endobronchial obstruction. Seven of 24 patients had radiographic improvement in the extent of atelectasis. Patients with both tumor appearances (endoluminal and submucosal/extrinsic compression) had significant improvements following HDR-BT with regard to hemoptysis. Patients with submucosal disease also had improvement in cough. Patients with peripheral tumors had better rates of response for hemoptysis and cough than did those with central tumors. CONCLUSION: HDR-BT may result in symptomatic improvement in patients with bronchogenic carcinoma, whether characterized endoscopically as endoluminal projection or submucosal infiltration/extrinsic compression. Peripheral tumors have better rates of response than central tumors, possibly on the basis of less extensive disease.",

(CHEST 1997; 112:946-53)\nKey words: brachytherapy;  bronchogenic carcinoma; lung cancer; radiotherapy\nAbbreviations:  CXR=chest  radiograph;  ECOG=Eastern  Cooperative  Oncology  Group;  HDR-BT= high-dose  rate brachytherapy\nLung cancer is  the leading cause of cancer death in North  America.  Of  the  estimated  170,000  new cases diagnosed each year, up to 80% will  be inopera› ble either at  presentation  or at thoracotomy. 1 Half of patients with inoperable lung cancer will develop symp› toms  referable  to  endobronchial  disease, 2 including hemoptysis, cough, dyspnea, and postobstructive pneu› monia. External-beam  radiotherapy  is the  standard palliative  treatment  for  patients  with  inoperable  lung\ncancer.  However, up  to 40% of patients  treated with external-beam  radiotherapy will develop  recurrent  or progressive intrathoracic disease. 3\nHigh-dose rate remote afterloading endobronchial irradiation  (brachytherapy)  has  been  used  increas› ingly as  a palliative  therapy to improve local control of endobronchial  tumor.  Studies  have  reported im› proved  symptoms  using  high-dose  rate  brachythe› rapy (HDR-BT) as the sole treatment modality, or in combination  with  external  irradiation  or  laser  de› bulking.4-6 HDR-BT  has  also  been  shown  to  be helpful  in  the  control  of symptoms  following  dose› limiting external  irradiation. 7 -9\nAs a  palliative  measure, HDR-BT  is relatively invasive  since in  most protocols,  multiple bronchos› copies are required for  the placement of brachythe› rapy catheters on successive occasions. Furthermore,\nthere  is  the  potential  for  morbidity  and  mortality during the placement of the brachytherapy catheters or as a result of  the treatment itself. Therefore, there is  a  need to  identify at the  outset the patients  most likely to benefit  from this intervention. To  our knowledge, this information is not currently available in  the literature.\nRadiation  delivered by HDR-BT is  characterized by  a rapid  fall-off  of  radiation  from  the  source originating in the airway.  10  This allows for high doses of radiation  to  be  delivered  to  target  tissues  while sparing normal surrounding tissue.l 1 Since HDR-BT delivers  the  highest  dose  of radiation  closest to the source, we hypothesized that endobronchial disease characterized  morphologically  by  submucosal  infil› tration  and!or  extrinsic  compression  may  be  less responsive than endoluminal disease because of the greater distance from the radiation source. Secondly, we  hypothesized  that  tumors  located  in  the  more central  ai1ways  (trachea  or  mainstem  bronchi)  may cause more symptoms than peripherally located dis› ease  since  there  is  potentially  a  greater  amount  of lung tissue affected, and consequently these patients may  respond  better to  the  intervention. Therefore, the purpose of this study was  to evaluate the poten› tial  importance of bronchoscopic tumor appearance and  tumor  location  as  determinants  of short-term response  to  HDR-BT  using  standardized symptom scores, bronchoscopic appearance,  and radiographic change as  outcomes.",

      "content": "Patients referred for brachytherapy generally have advanced  lung  cancer.  In  this  study,  subjects  had persistent  and/or  progressive  disease  despite  previ› ous external  irradiation.  The  treatment  goals for brachytherapy  at  our institution  are  thus  palliative rather than curative. With this in mind, the interven› tion  should  be  acceptable  to  patients  with  a  mini› mum of discomfort and without the need for hospi› talization.  Our  results  suggest  that  bronchoscopic tumor appearance does  not predict the response to endobronchial irradiation, and hence both subsets of patients  can  be  offered  this  modality  of  therapy. With  regard  to  tumor  location,  peripheral  disease appears  to  have  better  response  rates  than  more central tumor.  Based on these findings,  it would be reasonable  to  consider treating more peripheral tu› mor with  brachytherapy,  while  combined interven› tions,  such  as  laser  ablation  followed  by brachythe› rapy, could be used to attempt to achieve better rates of response in more centrally located tumors. Larger randomized  controlled  trials would  be  useful  to determine whether combined modality therapy im› proves symptoms related to airway involvement bet› ter than HDR brachytherapy alone, to better define the  role  of brachytherapy  in  the  palliation  of lung cancer.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS: The authors wish to thank the Radi› ation Oncology technicians and nurses, as well as the technicians of the  Department of Inhalation Therapy at  the  Royal  Victoria Hospital.",
