The set of tools that allow navigation, con /uniFB01 rmation of target proximity, and acquisition of tissue is collectively known as guided bronchoscopy . 2 The fundamental components of guided bronchoscopy are image-based airway navigation, real-time airway visualization, intraoperative con /uniFB01 rmatory imaging, and specimen acquisition tools.\nPivotal prospective trials mapped the strengths and weaknesses of guided bronchoscopy in its various iterations. 3-11 These studies de /uniFB01 ned diagnostic yield, provided safety data, and contrasted guided bronchoscopy with percutaneous sampling. 12 Although shown to be safer relative to transthoracic sampling, 12,13 the diagnostic yield of guided bronchoscopy historically has ranged between 44% and\n74%, 3-11 compared with rates of > 90% for percutaneous sampling. 12,13\nIn an attempt to overcome these limitations, two robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (RAB) platforms were developed and received Food and Drug Administration clearance. 14,15 The Monarch RAB platform (Auris Health, Inc.) is based on electromagnetic navigation (EMN) technology, 16,17 whereas the Ion RoboticAssisted Endoluminal Platform (Intuitive Surgical, Inc.) is based on novel shape-sensing RAB (ssRAB) technology. 18,19 RAB is designed to allow endobronchial navigation into the lung periphery while maintaining catheter stability and shape to maximize precision in sampling. 18 These advantages of RAB were demonstrated previously in cadaveric models. 20-23 In vivo, a study of EMN RAB reported a navigation success rate of 88.6% and a diagnostic yield of 69.1%. 24 A recent study combining RAB with cone-beam CT imaging indicated a diagnostic yield of 83%. 25 These studies also suggested that the diagnostic accuracy of RAB may not be as signi /uniFB01 cantly affected by factors that traditionally have been shown to attenuate the diagnostic yield of bronchoscopic sampling, such as lesion size, radiographic consistency, and lobar location. 3-11\nTo date, reported experience with ssRAB is limited to cadaveric studies 21,23 and small studies in humans. 25,26 In this article, we describe our experience with ssRAB sampling of pulmonary lesions by members of a collaborative team of interventional pulmonologists and thoracic surgeons. In this postmarketing report, we provide data on the safety pro /uniFB01 le of this method and evaluate its diagnostic yield in a high-volume US cancer center.",

      "content": "Pulmonary parenchymal lesions were de /uniFB01 ned as those bordered by lung parenchyma, requiring transbronchial sampling, not accessible by conventional bronchoscopy, or a combination thereof. 4,29,30 The widest lesion diameter and consistency were documented based on the planning CT imaging in the axial, coronal, and sagittal projections. 29 Centrality was de /uniFB01 ned as described previously by dividing the lung parenchyma into inner two-thirds and outer one-third. 31,32 An airway leading into the lesion or coursing through as so-called air bronchogram designated a positive bronchus sign. 33 The number of traversed airways during navigation was based on the scheme proposed by Weibel 34 and derived from ssRAB planning.\nssRAB was performed using the Ion Robotic-Assisted Endoluminal Platform, as described previously. 21 CT scan-based planning was conducted using PlanPoint software (Intuitive Surgical). All procedures were performed in a dedicated suite by an interventional pulmonologist or a thoracic surgeon. Each physician sampled a minimum of 10 lesions during the study period (range, 10-47 lesions). 22 The anesthesia protocol used during ssRAB is described in e-Appendix 1. Procedure time was documented from ssRAB arm docking to /uniFB01 nal undocking. After an initial airway survey with a /uniFB02 exible bronchoscope (BF-P190, BF-1T180, or BF1TH190; Olympus Corp.), the ssRAB catheter and vision probe were introduced into the airway and registration was performed to synchronize the virtual bronchoscopic view and the real-time camera view. As soon as the catheter was navigated to the target, the vision probe was removed and intraoperative con /uniFB01 rmation of proximity to the target was achieved using radial probe endobronchial ultrasound (rEBUS; UM-S20-17S or UM-S20-20R-3; Olympus Corp.), two-dimensional /uniFB02 uoroscopy (OEC 9900 Elite, GE Healthcare Systems), twoand three-dimensional /uniFB02 uoroscopy (Cios-Spin Mobile 3D C-Arm; Siemens Healthineers, Inc.), or a combination thereof. The choice of intraoperative imaging methods was left to the discretion of the operator. rEBUS view was de /uniFB01 ned as concentric, eccentric, or no-view, as described previously . 35,36 Successful navigation was assessed by the operator and was de /uniFB01 ned as achieving catheter-target proximity that allowed lesion sampling. Sampling was performed using a 19-, 21-, or 23-gauge Flexision needle (Intuitive Surgical). The choice of needle as well as use of adjunct sampling tools, including biopsy forceps (Captura Bronch Biopsy Forceps; Cook Medical, Inc.; or CoreDx Pulmonary Mini-Forceps; Boston Scienti /uniFB01 c), cytology brush (Cellebrity; Boston Scienti /uniFB01 c), BAL, or a combination thereof, was left to the discretion of the operator.

In line with previous studies, 5,8,24,30,36,37 three categories of pathologic diagnoses were de /uniFB01 ned: (1) malignant; (2) nonmalignant, including in /uniFB02 ammatory, infectious, and lymphocyte-predominant patterns; and (3) insuf /uniFB01 cient, including samples lacking suf /uniFB01 cient material to infer a diagnosis or showing at most benign bronchial or alveolar tissue.\nSamples demonstrating atypical cells that could not be classi /uniFB01 ed further were deemed insuf /uniFB01 cient. Each pathologic diagnostic category then was designated diagnostic or nondiagnostic based on a clinical-radiographic-pathologic correlation algorithm (e-Fig 2): all malignant lesions were considered diagnostic, unless proven falsepositive results by a surgical resection, whereas all insuf /uniFB01 cient samplings were considered nondiagnostic. Nonmalignant lesions were considered diagnostic if: (1) a nonmalignant cause was con /uniFB01 rmed by an alternative sampling method, such as transthoracic or surgical biopsy; (2) follow-up imaging demonstrated regression or resolution of the lesion; or (3) the lesion was shown to remain unchanged on follow-up imaging for $ 1 year. 5,7-11,38 If follow-up imaging revealed an increase in lesion size or stability over < 1 year, or if a clinical decision was made to pursue antineoplastic treatment despite results of the ssRAB sampling, the lesion was classi /uniFB01 ed as a false-negative (FN) /uniFB01 nding and hence nondiagnostic. 5,8,11,13,24,29,37 Lesions targeted for ssRAB, but not sampled because of unsuccessful navigation, also were considered nondiagnostic.\nSensitivity and negative predictive value of ssRAB for primary thoracic malignancies were de /uniFB01 ned as secondary outcomes and were calculated in line with prior studies. 5,8,30 Brie /uniFB02 y, all lesion samples that showed positive results for primary thoracic cancer were considered true-positive results, unless proven false-positive results by surgical resection. Lesions that were positive for nonthoracic malignancies were excluded from this analysis. Both nonmalignant and insuf /uniFB01 ciently sampled lesions were considered FN /uniFB01 ndings, unless con /uniFB01 rmed to be true-negative /uniFB01 ndings by meeting the diagnostic criteria for nonmalignant lesions (e-Fig 2), that is, con /uniFB01 rmed nonmalignant by ancillary sampling, regressed or resolved on follow-up imaging, or remained stable on follow-up imaging for $ 1 year.\nThe primary safety outcome of the study was 30-day procedure- or device-related adverse events, including (1) pneumothorax; (2) hemorrhage resulting in early termination of the procedure or intervention that is beyond the use of iced saline, topical epinephrine, or wedging of the bronchoscope; and (3) any increase in the patient ' s level of care as a direct result of ssRAB.",

We provided a rate of diagnostic yield and delineated the clinical, radiographic, and procedurerelated factors that impact the degree of diagnostic accuracy. To our knowledge, this is the /uniFB01 rst study to\nprovide comprehensive postmarketing evidence on the performance of ssRAB within a multidisciplinary clinical practice at a high-volume center.\nPrevious guided bronchoscopy studies report a wide range of 44% to 74% for diagnostic yield for lung lesions. 7,8,10,30,36 The gap in diagnostic yield between studies can be explained by different de /uniFB01 nitions of diagnostic tissue, especially in nonmalignant lesions, variability in platforms and tools between and within studies, and a wide range of experience and expertise among operators. 11 Meta-analyses of guided bronchoscopy report a pooled diagnostic accuracy in the range of 70% to 73% 43,44 and pooled sensitivity for lung cancer in the range of 73% to 77%. 43,45,46\nData on the diagnostic yield of RAB are scarce. In a prospective, multicenter feasibility study of the EMN\nRAB platform on 54 lesions, Chen et al 47 reported successful navigation in 96.2% of lesions and diagnostic sampling in 74.1% of lesions; however, this study was not designed to assess diagnostic yield as a primary outcome. Chaddha et al 24 reported a diagnostic yield of 69.1% with EMN RAB. In this study, determinants of diagnostic yield were the presence of a positive bronchus sign and ability to visualize the target via rEBUS. 24 Benn et al 25 reported a 83% rate of successful acquisition of diagnostic tissue from 59 lung nodules in 52 patients using ssRAB in combination with cone-beam CT imaging. However, this study provided a liberal estimate of diagnostic yield with only limited follow-up data on nonneoplastic nodules. 25\nOur study is distinguished by providing postmarketing experience of a heterogeneous group of interventional pulmonologists and thoracic surgeons along a range of prior expertise in guided bronchoscopy. Our study showed that successful navigation was achieved in 98.7% of the lesions and that the overall diagnostic yield was 81.7%. The major determinant of diagnostic sampling was lesion size. Notably, the diagnostic yield for traditionally challenging lesions of # 2.00 cm in our study was 69.6%, compared with previously reported guided bronchoscopy rates of 43% to 59%. 7,8,11 The diagnostic yield for lesions of > 2.0 cm in our study was\n95.7%, which is comparable with that of image-guided transthoracic sampling. 12,13 Our diagnostic yield for traditionally challenging lesions seems to be improved compared with prior studies. For example, the diagnostic yield was 71.1% for lesions with a negative bronchus sign, compared with 43% to 46% in prior studies. 7,8 Similarly, our diagnostic yield for lesions in the outer one-third of the lung was 70.9%, compared with 51.3% as reported by Ost et al. 8 Further, the ssRAB platform allowed us to sample more than one target in 19% of cases, and in a signi /uniFB01 cant proportion of those, bilateral lesions were targeted. Finally, the ssRAB platform provided advantageous overall and pneumothorax safety pro /uniFB01 les that are equal 7,8,26,47 or improved 5,24,25 compared with prior guided bronchoscopy studies. Our data demonstrate that although providing an excellent safety pro /uniFB01 le and improved diagnostic yield compared with prior guided bronchoscopy platforms, less accessible lesions -that is, smaller and peripheral -remain challenging also for the ssRAB platform, albeit with an improved diagnostic yield.\nBoth currently available RAB platforms include a fully articulating robotic catheter; however, the distinct characteristics of each may not make these platforms\nNondiagnostic\nDiagnostic\n]\ninterchangeable. 40,48 An important difference lies in the navigation and localization technology. ssRAB technology is applied in the form of a /uniFB01 ber that is embedded along the robotic catheter, providing realtime shape and location information that is corroborated with the CT scan-derived airway map throughout navigation and specimen acquisition. 18,26 In contrast, the EMN RAB technology uses an external electromagnetic /uniFB01 eld generator that localizes and tracks sensors embedded in the robotic catheter and corroborates those signals with the CT scan-derived airway map. 16,17 Other differences pertain to the outer diameter of the distal end of the robotic catheter, working channel size, visualization, and the controller style, as described previously. 48\nThis study has several limitations. This is a retrospective observational study conducted in a single, high-volume academic cancer center. Therefore, selection bias is possible with triaging of patients for ssRAB based on favorable imaging characteristics of the target lesion; however, a considerable proportion of the lesions in our study were considered challenging based on prior de /uniFB01 nitions, 5,7,8,11 that is, < 2.0 cm in widest diameter (67.4%), upper lobe location (59%), peripheral lung (39%), negative bronchus sign (37%), eccentric or no rEBUS view (47%), or a combination thereof. The prevalence of malignancy among our study participants was relatively high, as expected from a cancer center referral population. A cohort enriched by patients with high probability of cancer may increase the diagnostic\nyield because bronchoscopy is more sensitive for malignancy than for nonmalignant disease. 43,45 Therefore, our results can be generalized to populations with a relatively high suspicion for cancer. Our study is also limited by the number of participants and target lesions; this may account for the observation that point estimates of the predictors of diagnostic yield were showing in the expected direction, but failed to reach statistical signi /uniFB01 cance in the multivariate model.",

      "content": "To conclude, this study summarizes our initial clinical experience regarding the feasibility, diagnostic accuracy, and safety of ssRAB in the evaluation of 159 pulmonary lesions by a diverse group of bronchoscopists. This is also the /uniFB01 rst study to report successful collaboration between interventional pulmonologists and thoracic surgeons in establishing and operating a RAB service in a single high-volume academic center. Our data indicate that ssRAB\npresents a novel approach to access and sample pulmonary lesions successfully, with an overall diagnostic yield of 81.7%, while maintaining an excellent safety pro /uniFB01 le. In this study, diagnostic yield remained relatively high, albeit attenuated, for lesions that traditionally have been associated with a signi /uniFB01 cantly reduced diagnostic yield, mainly upper lobe and peripheral lesion location. Lesion size remains the main factor predicting a successful procedure; however, compared with prior reports of guided bronchoscopy, our data demonstrate improved diagnostic accuracy of smaller lesions and a diagnostic yield that is comparable with transthoracic biopsy for larger lesions. Prospective, multicenter trials are warranted to delineate further the strengths and limitations of ssRAB. 38 Collectively, our data suggest that ssRAB may offer a signi /uniFB01 cant advancement in the /uniFB01 eld of guided bronchoscopy, providing an enhanced, accurate, and safe diagnostic method in the evaluation of pulmonary parenchymal lesions.\nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) ¼ endobronchial ultrasound; ssRAB ¼ shape-sensing robotic-assisted bronchoscopy.\n]",
