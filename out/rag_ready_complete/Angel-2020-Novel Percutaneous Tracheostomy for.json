    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a worldwide pandemic, with many patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. Tracheostomy is not recommended by current guidelines as it is considered a superspreading event owing to aerosolization that unduly risks health care workers. METHODS: Patients with severe COVID-19 who were on mechanical ventilation for 5 days or longer were evaluated for percutaneous dilational tracheostomy. We developed a novel percutaneous tracheostomy technique that placed the bronchoscope alongside the endotracheal tube, not inside it. That improved visualization during the procedure and continued standard mechanical ventilation after positioning the inflated endotracheal tube cuff in the distal trachea. This technique offers a significant mitigation for the risk of virus aerosolization during the procedure. RESULTS: From March 10 to April 15, 2020, 270 patients with COVID-19 required invasive mechanical ventilation at New York University Langone Health Manhattan's campus; of those, 98 patients underwent percutaneous dilational tracheostomy. The mean time from intubation to the procedure was 10.6 ± 5 days. Currently, 32 patients (33%) do not require mechanical ventilatory support, 19 (19%) have their tracheostomy tube downsized, and 8 (8%) were decannulated. Forty patients (41%) remain on full ventilator support, and 19 (19%) are weaning from mechanical ventilation. Seven patients (7%) died as a result of respiratory and multiorgan failure. Tracheostomy-related bleeding was the most common complication (5 patients). None of health care providers has had symptoms or tested positive for COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Our percutaneous tracheostomy technique appears to be safe and effective for COVID-19 patients and safe for health care workers.",

Our percutaneous tracheostomy technique appears to be safe and effective for COVID-19 patients and safe for health care workers.\n(Ann Thorac Surg 2020;110:1006-11) /C211 2020 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons\nC oronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a worldwide pandemic, with more than 2.4 million cases diagnosed to date. 1 Although most COVID-19 patients will not require supportive care, 10% to 15% of patients have acute respiratory distress that requires invasive ventilatory support. 2,3 Mechanical ventilation for patients infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is associated with prolonged airway intubation and high worldwide mortality of at least 50% to 67%. 4-6 Based on the previous experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, aerosol-generating procedures such as tracheal intubation or performing tracheostomy were considered highrisk procedures for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to health care workers. 7 The American Academy of Otolaryngology and the Ears, Nose, Throat Surgery in the United Kingdom have stated providers should ' avoid\ntracheotomy in COVID-19 positive or suspected patients ' owing to the risks to health care providers.\nThese guidelines, based on limited evidence, recommend that tracheostomies should not be performed earlier than 2 to 3 weeks after intubation, preferably after negative COVID-19 testing, 8,9 and recommend open tracheostomy placement in these circumstances as opposed to percutaneous dilational tracheostomy (PDT).

      "content": "The PDT was performed at the bedside in the patient ' s ICU room. All personnel wore full personal protection equipment per institutional policies (hair cover, N95 mask, surgical mask, face shield, gown, and two layers of gloves) on entering the room. Team members had three roles: (1) performing the bronchoscopy; (2) placing the tracheostomy; and (3) operating the ventilator, applying medication for sedation, and endotracheal tube management. The patient was placed supine with a shoulder roll in standard position for a percutaneous tracheostomy. Sedation and paralytics were given before the procedure (Figure 1a; see Appendix for protocol).\nAnterior neck Doppler ultrasonography was performed with a linear probe to identify anatomic landmarks and vascular structures, and to mark the site of insertion between the /uniFB01 rst and second tracheal rings. Maximal oxygenation was performed before the procedure. The endotracheal tube (ETT) was freed from the holder, and the bronchoscope was inserted adjacent to the ETT and advanced to the level of the vocal cords (Figure 1b). The bronchoscope was advanced past the vocal cords, anterior to the ETT (Figure 1c). With the ventilator on standby\nmode, we de /uniFB02 ated the ETT cuff and advanced the ETT further into the distal trachea. The ETT cuff was rein /uniFB02 ated and the ventilator restarted. We then performed the PDT. The needle and catheter were inserted into the airway under direct visualization (Figure 1d). The guidewire was threaded into the airway and directed caudally (Figure 1e). A super /uniFB01 cial, small (0.5 cm) skin incision was made after the wire was in place. The track was dilated with a short dilator, then with the Ciaglia Blue Rhino (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN) dilator (Figure 1f). Before insertion of the tracheostomy tube, the ventilator was put on standby mode again, and the ETT cuff was de /uniFB02 ated. The ETT was withdrawn under direct visualization until it was proximal to the tracheostomy site. A percutaneous tracheostomy tube (Shiley /uniFB02 exible tracheostomy tube 8.5; Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) was inserted into the trachea, the cuff was in /uniFB02 ated, and the bronchoscope was advanced through the tracheostomy tube to con /uniFB01 rm position and to remove any blood or secretions from the airway. The ventilator was then connected and restarted once the circuit was closed.\nTo improve access to the subglottic space, we used a therapeutic bronchoscope (Olympus America, Chelmsford, MA). This scope ensures enough torque and rigidity to maneuver around the ETT and push through the anterior space of the vocal cords. Secretions were suctioned from the mouth and retropharynx before bronchoscope insertion to improve visualization. When the ETT is seen in the posterior aspect of the vocal cords, a ' jaw thrust ' maneuver with a posterior push on the ETT helped open the space to facilitate passage of the bronchoscope.",

      "title": "Comment",
      "content": "From March 10 to April 15, 2020, we had 270 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted to the ICU with severe respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. Their respiratory failure, as previously reported, was prolonged, with an average duration to this date of 18 days. We believed that an earlier tracheostomy provided the optimal care to these patients, who in addition to the severe respiratory failure, were also receiving high levels of sedation or paralysis, had major issues with increased airway secretions, and limited access to respiratory and physical therapy as a result of the overwhelming number of patients on mechanical ventilation and the risk presented by SARS-CoV-2 to health care workers.\nThis study reports the feasibility of performing this novel technique for PDT in patients stricken with COVID-19. For the 98 patients who ful /uniFB01 lled the inclusion criteria appropriate for PDT, 96 PDTs (98%) were successfully performed. The other 2 patients had severe subglottic edema that required a standard approach to PDT; these 2 patients were on ECMO support and did not require ventilation during the procedure.\nThe early outcomes appear to support the many bene /uniFB01 ts of tracheostomy placement. As shown in other series,\ntracheostomy may reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation requirement and lead to shorter ICU stays. 10,11 The placement of a tracheostomy enables better management of secretions due to easier suctioning and the ability to change the inner cannula. That is a major bene /uniFB01 t for patients with COVID-19. Owing to improved comfort, patients with tracheostomy can be weaned from heavy sedation, 5 which has the added bene /uniFB01 t of decreased use of the paralytic agents and sedatives that were required in more than 56% of these patients. Moreover, patients with a tracheostomy undergoing ventilator support weaning are more easily able to participate in respiratory therapy, physical therapy, and to sit in a chair, contributing to faster recovery. Although there was a 7% mortality rate, this early mortality report is signi /uniFB01 cantly lower than the 50% to 67% reported in the literature on COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical respiratory support. 4-6 This /uniFB01 nding re /uniFB02 ects that our inclusion criteria selected the patients with the highest potential bene /uniFB01 t from an early tracheostomy and survival. Indeed, 32 patients (33%) have already been weaned entirely off ventilator support, with 19 (19%) of those patients downsized and 8 (8%) decannulated from their tracheostomy tubes.\nNo intraprocedural complications were noted, and bleeding was minimized as we always performed ultrasonography with Doppler in the selected access area. Seventy-one patients (72%) who underwent PDT were receiving therapeutic anticoagulation drugs; 5 of those patients (5.1%) had bleeding within the /uniFB01 rst 48 hours of the procedure that required bedside packing around the tracheostomy, with 1 patient requiring surgical management. Another potential bene /uniFB01 t of tracheostomies is the decreased incidence of tracheal stenosis in the subglottic space. 11 Two patients already had granulation tissue and subglottic stenosis at the time of bronchoscopy. After discharge from the ICU, all patients are followed by speech pathology and otolaryngology for /uniFB01 nal decannulation and independent evaluation of long-term complications.\nA key /uniFB01 nding of this study is that all providers who have participated in the bedside percutaneous tracheostomy procedures remain COVID-19 negative by symptoms or by testing. There was no conversion rate in the four providers (50%) who agreed to testing, and no providers have had any symptoms develop or have missed any work days. All providers wore standard personal protection equipment. We decreased the number of health care providers in the room to three team members, minimized the amount of time with an open-air system to a few seconds, and had no time with active ventilation and aerosolization during the open-air system. Compared with a standard bedside PDT,\nwhich has an open-air system with active ventilation and aerosolization through most of the procedure, this modi /uniFB01 ed technique is bene /uniFB01 cial for COVID-19 patients because of the high risk for transmission with aerosolization of the virus. 12 The bene /uniFB01 ts to the patient must always be balanced against the risk to the provider; this technique moves toward optimizing the former without unnecessarily risking the latter.\nOur paper has strengths and weaknesses. It is the largest report in the literature with 98 COVID-19 patients on mechanical ventilation undergoing PDT. We also demonstrate a high success rate in performing this novel technique, with safe patient and health care provider outcomes and minimal postprocedural complications. In addition, this study is the /uniFB01 rst to demonstrate how to perform a PDT that mitigates the aerosolization of SARSCoV-2 during the procedure. Most important, the early outcomes reported support that tracheostomies are bene /uniFB01 cial for these patients and that PDT can be safely performed with low health care worker exposure to the virus. There are several /uniFB02 aws, however, including the short duration of this initial report, with only early outcomes being available with an average follow-up of 18 days after starting mechanical ventilation. Also, not all health care workers providers involved both in the procedure and in the postprocedure care have been tested by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or SARSCoV-2 antibodies, and a certain percent of COVID-19 infected people are asymptomatic; however, it is impossible to determine the value of a positive test, as daily testing was not feasible and the continuous high level of exposure during the 5 weeks of providing critical care to COVID-19 patients outside the PDT procedures.\nThe described technique allows optimal COVID-19 patient care in the ICU while minimizing the risk of infection for health care workers. The technique is described in detail and is easy to perform. This study supports that, at early review, both can be achieved. On a larger scale, the earlier weaning from mechanical ventilation may increase the number of available ICU beds and ventilators needed to adequately treat the large demands from these COVID19 patients. Further follow-up studies on this cohort will evaluate late outcomes of this technique and evaluate its ef /uniFB01 cacy and value in patients with COVID-19.",
