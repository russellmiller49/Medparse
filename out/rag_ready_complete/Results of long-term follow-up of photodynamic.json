    "abstract": "Background: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is considered a useful and minimally invasive modality for treating centrally located early lung cancer. To date, there has been limited information on the long-term outcome of patients treated with PDT, especially those who are medically operable.\nMethods: Beginning in 1994, patients with roentgenographically occult bronchogenic squamous cell carcinoma (ROSCC) who met our criteria underwent PDT at Tohoku University Hospital and were followed up through 2006. Our criteria were as follows: (1) ROSCC without distant metastasis; (2) medically operable by means of lobectomy or further resection; (3) longitudinal tumor length of < 10 mm; and (4) superficial bronchoscopic tumor findings.\nResults: A total of 48 patients with ROSCC underwent PDT. The complete response (CR) rate was 94% (45 of 48 of patients). Nine patients (20%) had local recurrence after CR. A total of 11 deaths was observed, with 6 resulting from multiple primary lung cancer and only 1 from the original ROSCC. The 5-year and 10-year overall survival rates for all 48 patients were 81% and 71%, respectively. The Cox proportional hazard model showed that only metachronous multiple primary lung cancer was an independent poor prognostic factor.\nConclusions: PDT is thought to be a first-line modality for patients who have ROSCC with a tumor length of < 10 mm, even if the tumor is medically operable. Most local recurrence can be cured by active therapy such as surgery, radiotherapy, or PDT. Multiple primary lung cancer subsequent to PDT is an important issue from the viewpoint of survival.",

      "content": "Our classification of ROSCC bronchoscopic findings has been described previously. 3 In brief, findings were classified into the following three categories: remarkable, minute, and hidden. 'Remarkable' meant that a lesion could be identified easily as a tumor > 2 mm in height. 'Minute' indicated that a lesion could be identified as a tumor only with difficulty, and was ≤ 2 mm in height. A 'hidden' lesion was one that could not be seen using a conventional bronchoscope or that showed no characteristic changes related to carcinoma. Hidden lesions could be detected only by bronchial biopsy, brushing cytology, or autofluorescence bronchoscopy (AFB). Since 1997, AFB (LIFE system; Xilix Technologies; Vancouver, BC, Canada) and endobronchial ultrasonography have also been used for the evaluation of ROSCC. AFB is useful for precisely determining the size of the lesion, 4,5 whereas endobronchial ultrasonography may prove beneficial in evaluating the depth of tumor invasion. 6,7\nPDT\nPDT procedures were performed with porfimer sodium (Photofrin; Wyeth Japan KK; Tokyo, Japan) and an excimer dye laser (EDL-1; Hamamatsu Photonics; Hamamatsu, Japan). All patients received 2 mg/kg porfimer sodium IV, 48 h before light irradiation. A quartz fiber was used to carry the laser light through a bronchoscope to the lesions. The total energy of the laser irradiation was 100 J/cm 2 , and the duration of irradiation was usually 10 to 20 min. Bronchial toileting to remove necrotic tissues produced by PDT was routinely performed at 7 days after PDT. The lesions were evaluated by brushing cytology and biopsy specimen histology at 1, 2, and 3 months after PDT. Thereafter, patients were assessed with bronchoscopy, sputum cytology, and chest CT scan every 3 months for the first year, and every 6\nmonths from the second through the fifth years. After that, patients were examined annually using sputum cytology and chest CT scan.\nTumor response to PDT was classified into the following two categories: complete response (CR); and non-CR. A CR was defined as the absence of any demonstrable tumor by biopsy or brushing cytology for at least 4 weeks.\nLocal recurrence was defined as a tumor that recurred at the same lesion as the PDT lesion after CR. Multiple primary lung cancer was defined according to the criteria of Martini and Melamed. 8",

      "content": "The long-term results of PDT for a total of 48 patients with ROSCC are reported in this article. Our cases differed from those in previous studies 1,11-15 in the following respects. First, all patients were medically operable; they selected PDT after fully informed consent. We offered two options ( ie , surgical resection and PDT) to patients with ROSCC who were medically operable and met our PDT criteria, as mentioned earlier. Most of them selected PDT after fully informed consent, although we did not have the precise number of patients who selected surgery. Second, all lesions were marked by\nLLB = left lingual bronchus; Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) = non-small cell lung cancer; RLL = right lower lobe; SCLC = small cell lung cancer. See Table 2 for abbreviations not used in the text.\nTime after PDT (days)\nonly a superficial change in the bronchial epithelium. In previous articles, 1,13-18 some lesions had nodular findings, which meant that not all cases necessarily possessed superficial changes in the bronchial epithelium. It has been shown 14,19-21 that some tumor qualities make successful treatment by PDT less likely. One of these qualities is tumor invasion into or beyond the cartilaginous layer of the bronchus. We reported previously that the depth of tumor invasion would be within the cartilaginous layer if the bronchoscopic finding was either 'minute' or 'hidden' according to our classification system. 3 An ROSCC with a bronchoscopic finding of 'remarkable' sometimes invades beyond the cartilaginous layer. It was therefore supposed that the tumors found in our patients were less likely to invade beyond the bronchial cartilaginous layer and would therefore be more suitable for PDT. Last, our study followed up\npatients for a longer period than did those in other reports. Accordingly, the local recurrence rate and the incidence of metachronous multiple primary lung cancer should be more precise. Local recurrence was found only within 4 years of PDT. However, metachronous primary lung cancer was found even after that. To our knowledge, this is the first report where 10-year OS, RFS, and DFS after PDT have been described.\nCR was achieved in 94% of patients, with a recurrence rate of 20%. Even if PDT is used only in patients in whom ROSCC is marked by a superficial change of the bronchial epithelium, some patients will have local recurrence. However, most of these patients can be cured by salvage therapy. Both the log-rank test and multivariate survival analysis with the Cox proportional hazard model showed that local recurrence had no influence on survival after PDT. However, the Cox proportional hazard model showed that multiple primary lung cancer was an independent prognostic factor. We have previously reported 22 the frequency and the treatment of multiple primary lung cancer in patients with resected roentgenographically occult lung cancer, where the cumulative rate of postoperative metachronous multiple primary lung cancer was 0.11 5 years after the initial operation, and the OS rates for solitary and multiple resected occult lung cancers 5 years after the initial operation were 0.90 and 0.59, respectively, which is a statistically significant difference (p < 0.01). Multicentricity in roentgenographically occult lung cancer is a very important matter in terms of prognosis after the initial treatment. Although the main themes in studying the effectiveness of PDT for lung cancer have so far been tumor response or local\nThe Cox proportional hazard model showed that metachronous multiple primary lung cancer was an independent poor prognostic factor (hazard ratio, 1.99; 95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 4.03). Tumor location, local recurrence, and tumor response were not significant prognostic factors. += positive.\nrecurrence, we also have to consider metachronous multiple primary lung cancer after PDT and its impact on prognosis.\nAs stated in the American College of Chest Physicians guidelines, 2 the use of PDT for patients who are surgical candidates has so far remained limited. Because all of our patients were medically operable, the current study could offer new important information. In our previous report 19 on the results of surgical treatment for ROSCC, the 5-year OS rate of the 94 ROSCC patients was 80%, which was comparable to the results of the current study. However, the 10-year OS rate of 207 patients undergoing surgical treatment for ROSCCs was 40%, 23 which was much lower than the 70% 10-year OS rate found in the current study. We do not know the precise reason for a greater 10-year survival after PDT than after surgery. However, the following could be the reason. PDT does not result in the pulmonary function loss, so that adequate therapy, including surgery, can be undertaken for either local recurrence or the subsequent primary lung cancer after PDT. However, pulmonary resection would cause pulmonary function loss, so that an additional resection may be impossible even if surgery is the most curative therapy for local recurrence or the subsequent primary lung cancer after the initial resection. Moreover, quality of life after PDT should be better than that after pulmonary resection.\nThe current study is one of the largest assessing the effectiveness of PDT for early lung cancer. The design of the study was retrospective and observational, so its information might be limited. However, when PDT is employed with curative intent, its main targets are centrally located, early bronchogenic squamous cell carcinomas, which account for a very small percentage of all lung cancers. Given this fact, even retrospective studies can offer important information. Actually, to date, only one prospective study 1 has been published.\nIn summary, the current study indicates that PDT is thought to be a first-line modality for patients who have ROSCC with a tumor length of ≤ 10 mm, even if they are medically operable. After PDT, a 5-year OS rate of about 80% and a 10-year OS rate of 70% can be expected for these patients after PDT. Most local recurrence can be cured by salvage therapy such as surgery, radiotherapy, or PDT. During longterm follow-up after PDT, lung cancer was the most frequent cause of deaths, and multiple primary lung cancer was the most important issue from the viewpoint of survival. Further study, especially a prospective study, should be conducted to get a robust data of PDT for medically operable patients with ROSCC.",
