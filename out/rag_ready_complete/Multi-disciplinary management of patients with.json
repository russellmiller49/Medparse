      "title": "1. Classifications and physiology",
      "content": "In patients with benign airway strictures, clear definitions and classifications are needed to determine the appropriate treatment options and predict  clinical  course.  Benign  airway  strictures  can  involve  the upper and central airways extending from the supraglottis to the lobar airways. Irrespective of location, a physiologically abnormal obstruction is defined as narrowing of the airway by > 50%. In patients with mild airway stenosis (i.e. < 50% reduction in the cross-sectional area [CSA]), the airflow pressure drop along the stenotic segment which determines the work of breathing, is similar to the pressure gradient through the\nnormal glottic opening and thus is unlikely to cause significant dyspnea, even with exertion [1]. Moderate stenosis (51 -70% reduction in CSA) could  cause  symptoms  on  exertion  with  a  significant  pressure  drop occurring at higher flow rates. Severe stenosis ( > 71% reduction in CSA) results in significant pressure gradient even at a low flow rates leading to symptoms at rest or mild exertion. Objective quantification of the degree of narrowing determines whether a certain airway stricture contributes to patient ' s dyspnea. There are other symptoms, however, that impact the decision-making process pertinent to treatment. Patients with laryngotracheal stenosis (LTS) can have symptoms other than dyspnea such as dysphagia and dysphonia. In fact, some classification systems address",

Table 1 summarizes and describes the pros and cons of each of the published classification systems [2 -8]. While the ideal system in the classification of LTS remains questionable, a recent study assessed three classification systems to effectively stratify the risk of long term tracheostomy and demonstrated that the McCaffrey and Lano systems offer more precision than the Cotton-Myer scale [9]. We believe that regardless of which classification system one uses, a proper documentation  of  laryngeal  or  tracheal  stenosis  should  be  based  on  objective criteria and include: assessment of functional impairment (eg. Dyspnea scales,  performance  status);  length  of  the  stenotic  airway;  shape (circumferential, elliptical, crescent or triangular), complexity (with or without malacia) and precise location (centimeters or number of rings below  or  above  a  specific  reference  point-vocal  cords,  cricoid,  main carina for laryngotracheal strictures or main carina, primary and secondary carinas for bronchial strictures) [10].\nThe optimal management of benign airway strictures requires the collaboration  and  availability  of  a  multidisciplinary  team,  including otolaryngology,  thoracic  surgery  and  interventional  pulmonology.  A thorough history and physical exam is essential in identifying the etiology of the stricture and its possible association with other systemic diseases  [Table  2].  This  includes  history  of  autoimmune  disorders, airway infection, previous airway instrumentation, history of endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy, prior surgery or trauma. Objective evaluation includes computed tomography (CT) of the neck and chest with  multiplanar  reconstruction  or  3D  internal  and  external  reconstruction (Fig. 1A) as well as serological tests for working up potential underlying  connective  tissue  disorders  (CTD).  Pulmonary  function testing with attention to the flow volume loops can help detect patterns of airflow obstruction and allow monitoring physiologic changes after interventions. Of note, the classic pattern of truncated inspiratory and expiratory limbs is not sensitive and may only be seen when the tracheal diameter is reduced to 6 -8 mm [11] (Fig. 1B). Patients with unilateral bronchial stenosis may present with a biphasic flow-volume loop, but these findings are also not sensitive [12]. Once non-invasive assessment is completed, the next step is to evaluate the extent and severity of the narrowing and its impact on functional status, voice and swallowing. This involves performing a flexible laryngoscopy and/or a white light bronchoscopy. Biopsies could help narrow the differential diagnosis and rule out an underlying malignant process and may help in diagnosing a benign process. Depending on the disease extent, location, etiology and operability, the care of these patients requires the expertise of a multidisciplinary  airway  team.  Endoscopic  options  include  endoscopic resection, endoscopic dilation, intralesional injection of drugs, endoluminal stents and Montgomery T-tubes. Open surgical options include a chronic indwelling tracheostomy, cricotracheal/laryngotracheal resection with primary anastomosis reconstruction. Given the multitude of techniques learned through different training pathways, major academic centers have implemented such teams for management of patients with benign airway strictures. In this article we propose a multi-disciplinary algorithmic  approach  for  the  management  of  patients  with  benign airway strictures based on currently published evidence and available local expertise [Fig. 2].",

Agrawal et al.\ncourse [17], a negative ANCA does not permit exclusion of GPA. In fact, only  56 -60%  of  the  patients  may  be  ANCA  positive  at  the  time  of diagnosis or relapse of SGS related to GPA [18,19]. Serologic testing, however, should be performed in all patients with SGS, as there is about 1  in  4  chance  of  identifying  an  underlying  connective  tissue  disease (CTD). In  a  study  of  92  patients  with  non-traumatic  LTS,  75%  were found to be idiopathic LTS, but 25% were due to autoimmune disease. In fact, this study showed that ANCA antibodies were only positive in patients with GPA with all other serological testing being equivocal between the two cohorts [20]. The histopathologic assessment in SGS often demonstrates  nonspecific  fibrosis  and  infiltration  by  neutrophils  and epithelioid histiocytes and rarely shows overt vasculitis or granulomatous disease [17 -19]. SGS can also be seen with other CTDs, such as Relapsing Polychondritis (RP). In a large case series of patients with RP, SGS was noted in 5.5% (8/145) of patients [21]. This is often associated with malacia extending to trachea and mainstem bronchi. Other possible etiologies of SGS are listed in Table 2. Despite a thorough work up, in cases when no etiology is identified, a diagnosis of iSGS is established [22 -24]. Idiopathic SGS is primarily seen in females, often in the 5th decade of life [25]. GERD can be seen in up to 65% of the patients with iSGS. There is some evidence demonstrating an imbalance between estrogen  receptor-alpha,  estrogen  receptor-beta,  and  progesterone  receptors in surgical specimens from female idiopathic subglottic stenosis patients, possibly indicating a role in inappropriate inflammation and increased stenosis susceptibility in these patients [26].",

      "title": "2.2. Management of idiopathic subglottic stenosis",
      "content": "A variety of treatment modalities are used for the management of idiopathic subglottic stenosis (iSGS). This includes medical therapy (oral steroids, inhaled steroids, anti-reflux medications and oral antibacterial medications), endoscopic dilation, endoscopic resection and open surgery [27].\nThe open surgical approach in patients with iSGS involves a singlestaged laryngotracheal  resection  and  reconstruction  (LTRR).  A  metaanalysis  showed  a  success  rate  of  95%  in  patients  undergoing  LTRR [28]. In a large series, Wang et al. reported outcomes of 263 patients that underwent  LTRR  with  93.5%  (243/261)  patients  extubated  in  the operating room and 6.1% (16/261) patients requiring a temporary tracheostomy at the end of the surgery [25]. Anastomotic complications such as granulation, subcutaneous emphysema or early stenosis were noted in 11.7% (31/261) patients at the 30-days post op. On long-term follow-up (median -66 months), delayed recurrence occurred in 8.7% (23/261)  patients  with  3.4%  (9/261)  patients  requiring  repeat  laser assisted  mechanical  dilation  (LAMD)  every  6  months.  A  further follow-up survey in 180 of these patients showed that normal voice was present in 45% patients (82/180), while a change in voice occurred in 54% (96/180) patients with 67% (121/180) having a difficulty in projective voice. This is consistent with the data from a recent systematic review that also showed significantly worse voice quality in patients who underwent open resection [29].\nThere is lack of data on the role of medical therapy alone for patients with iSGS. However, studies have demonstrated a benefit from synergistic use of a combination of anti-reflux medications, oral trimethoprim-sulfamethaxazole and inhaled corticosteroids along with endoscopic therapies with a possible reduction in the rate of recurrence [27,30].  For  patients  with  iSGS,  endoscopic  resection  with  adjuvant medical therapy (ERMT) has been suggested as the first line of management.  Endoscopy  has  the  advantage  of  being  a  less  invasive  and outpatient  approach.  It  also  has  fewer  complications  than  the  open surgical approach in regards to voice-related outcomes. In a large prospective cohort study by Gelbard et al., patients who underwent ERMT were noted to have a lower recurrence rate (12.4%) compared to patients to underwent endoscopic dilation (either with a rigid instrument or  balloon  dilation)  alone  (28%)  [30,31].  Patients  who  underwent crico-tracheal resection (CTR) were noted to have the lowest recurrence (1.2%) but the open surgery was associated with the higher peri-operative risk and worse postoperative patient-related voice outcomes. However patients who underwent CTR had the most surgical procedures  performed  (mean = 5)  before  open  reconstruction  [30]. Endoscopic resection entails removal of a significant portion of the scar using  CO2 laser  [31]  or  knife  with  a ' mucosal  sparing  technique ' . Topical Mitomycin C has been used as an adjuvant treatment following mucosal sparing interventions and has been shown to reduce time to re-intervention. There is no consensus, however, on its routine use given possible complications and association with anastomotic complications in patients who underwent surgical resection [25,32,33]. When used, two applications of 0.5 mg/ml of topical mitomycin C can be considered at a 3 -4 week interval [33]. Intralesional injection of steroids can be performed as part of the ERMT procedure to potentially decrease scar tissue  formation  [34].  A  few  recent  studies  have  shown  that  serial in-office  intralesional  steroids  with  triamcinolone  40  mg/ml  using topical anesthesia 3 -6 weeks apart resulted in decreased recurrence of stenosis  and  increased  the  endoscopy  free  interval  [35,36].  If  symptomatic recurrence occurs after endoscopic intervention, surgical candidacy for an open surgical intervention for these patients should be considered.\nThus,  the  published  data  seem  to  justify  the  following  approach: ERMT first  and  consider  LTRR  in  cases  of  frequent  recurrence.  The definition of frequent recurrence is not clear from the literature, with investigators  performing  surgery  after  3 -7  endoscopic  interventions [30]. If a patient is noted to be a poor candidate for open surgery, then\nA. Agrawal et al.\nrepeated  endoscopic  interventions  with  adjuvant  local  and  medical therapy should be the mainstay of treatment and based on symptoms. A T-tube placement could be considered in refractory patients with need for repeat frequent interventions.",

      "content": "Endoscopic interventions and systemic immunosuppressive therapy remains the cornerstone of management of symptomatic SGS in patients with connective tissue disorders such as GPA. While clinical remission rates have improved with newer pharmacologic therapies in these patients, studies suggest that SGS can prove refractory to pharmacologic therapy alone with up to 62% patient experiencing a relapse on conventional GPA therapy [18]. A recent study demonstrated that Rituximab  may  be  more  effective  than  other  conventional  GPA  therapy (methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine or TMP/SMX) in management of otolaryngologic manifestations of GPA including SGS [37]. LTRR in patients with GPA and SGS has been associated with disease relapse even in a highly selective group with 55 -75% patients requiring additional tracheal dilation and 9 -13% patients requiring a permanent tracheostomy [38,39]. In addition, patients with a systemic autoimmune disease causing SGS may also be susceptible to lower airway stenosis (mainstem  bronchial  or  lobar)  that  may  need  repeated  endoscopic procedures [40]. These include LAMD or electrocautery knife-assisted radial  incisions  with  mechanical  dilation  using  a  rigid  bronchoscope or balloon dilation along with intralesional steroids injection [15,18, 41].  Given  the  high  risk  of  recurrence  and  risk  of  developing  lower airway disease, close  clinical  and  bronchoscopic  follow  up  is  recommended in these patients to ensure early diagnosis and management. Indeed,  these  patients  will  likely  require  multiple  bronchoscopic  dilations during the course of their illness. In a study with 47 patients,\nafter the first endoscopic procedure, the cumulative incidence of endoscopic treatment failure was 50% at 1 year, 70% at 2 years and 80% at 5 years [42].\nSimilarly,  the  primary  treatment  of  patients  with  SGS  in  patients with RP includes management of the underlying disease with immunosuppressive  therapy.  Patients  with  refractory  disease  may  require endoscopic interventions or tracheostomy [21].",

      "content": "Benign tracheal stenosis is the end result of an altered inflammatory response to injury and excessive scar formation and possibly cartilage destruction leading to malacia. Post-intubation stenosis (PITS) and post tracheostomy tracheal stenosis (PTTS) appear to be the most common benign LTS followed by idiopathic and autoimmune causes [43]. PITS can be seen in 1 -21% of intubated patients with 1 -2% patients developing severe stenosis [44,45]. The risk factors of PITS include duration of intubation, size of endotracheal tube, cuff pressure ( ≥ 30 mm H2O), trauma during intubation and need for reintubation, infection, previous radiation  and  diabetes  mellitus.  Symptomatic  PTTS  can  be  seen  in 1.5 -1.7% patients undergoing tracheostomy [46 -48]. The risk factors for  post-tracheostomy tracheal stenosis includes obesity, delayed tracheostomy after orotracheal intubation, endotracheal tube cuff pressure ≥ 30 mm H2O, percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy and an initial tracheostomy tube size of > 6 [48,49]. We also believe that excessive force during a percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy with subsequent cartilage fracture or compression will result in PTTS, often of a complex morphology and more difficult to manage given higher location and chondritis [50]. Other causes of benign tracheal stenosis are listed in\nA.

      "content": "Patients with a tracheal stenosis with cricoid involvement who are not  in  acute  respiratory  distress  should  be  evaluated  for  tracheal resection of the hypertrophic stenotic segment with end-to-end anastomosis.  This  may  include  LTRR  based  on  the  extent  of  the  stenotic segment. Endoscopic interventions such as LAMD are considered as a bridge to surgery in patients with acute respiratory distress or performed in  patients  who  are  not  surgical  candidates  (Fig.  3A).  The  role  of endoluminal  silicone  stenting  in  these  patients  is  discussed  above. However, given the high location of the stenosis and involvement of the cricoid, a T-tube can be considered in patients who develop recurrent silicone stent migration or in those who already have a tracheostomy [51]. Complications of a T-tube include granulation at the stomal site,\nsubglottic edema and retention of secretions. There are life-threatening complications due to obstruction of the T tube by thick gluey secretions [52] and mucus plugging. The inherent disadvantage of a T-tube is the need for a tracheostomy as compared to a dedicated endoluminal stent. It also requires patient compliance with pulmonary hygiene measures including but not limited to saline nebulization, deep breathing exercises  and  self-suctioning.  It  thus  can  significantly  compromise  the quality of life. In our opinion, T -tubes should be reserved for patients who are not surgical candidates for  open resection and endoluminal stent placement that is associated with recurrent stent-related complications.",

      "title": "3.3. Management of tracheal stenosis without cricoid involvement",
      "content": "The  management  of  isolated  tracheal  stenosis  depends  upon  the complexity  of  the  stricture,  associated  co-morbidities  and  patient ' s ability to undergo open surgical resection. A multi-disciplinary discussion  must  thus  occur  in  the  beginning  of  managing  such  patients  to determine  the  most  optimal  first  management  strategy.  Endoscopic management as an initial approach can be considered in patients with a simple  web-like  stenosis  ( < 1  cm)  with  only  mucosal  involvement without cartilage destruction (Fig. 3B) [53]. The endoscopic techniques involve laser- or electrocautery-assisted assisted radial incisions of the scar/web followed by mechanical dilation using a rigid bronchoscope or\nA. Agrawal et al.\nballoon tracheoplasty [54,55]. For patients with a complex stenosis with a  long  segment  lesion  ( > 1  cm)  or  associated  cartilage  involvement, surgical resection of the involved airway segment is the preferred modality and should be offered before any endoscopic attempts. In fact, some endoscopic procedures (i.e. stenting) may lengthen the extent of the  narrow  segment  potentially  precluding  a  curative-intent  surgical resection [56].\nTracheal  resection  and  reconstruction  (TRR)  is  the  surgical  intervention of choice and is considered a relatively safe procedure with the overall success rate reported to be > 95% [57,58] (Fig. 4). Patient selection is paramount since both modifiable and non-modifiable factors such as diabetes mellitus, prior tracheostomy, stricture location (high subglottic), or length of resection ( > 4 -5 cm) may lead to anastomotic complications [59]. Patients are weaned off steroids before open surgery if possible to avoid deleterious effects on wound healing [57].\nIn patients with symptomatic tracheal stenosis who are not candidates for open surgery, endoscopic interventions such as LAMD with or without silicone stent placement are performed given reproducible evidence on improving lung function and on quality of life (QOL) [10,60]. Of note, while self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS) may provide ease\nof placement via flexible bronchoscopy, the US Food and Drug Administration has recommended against the use of SEMS for benign airway stenosis due to excessive granulation formation, airway injury and stent fracture [10,61]. Silicone stents, however, may be used for long-term palliation in non-surgical candidates [54,60,62 -64]. Silicone stenting in patients with benign tracheal stenosis does not have to be a life-long intervention. Some patients may be become operable in which case the stent will be removed allowing for tracheal healing and then proceeding with surgical resection. In addition in some patients tracheal remodeling can occur after long term indwelling stenting and the stent could be removed without the need for further intervention. For example, in a large study by Dumon et al., 263 patients underwent 419 silicone stent placements for tracheal stenosis [64]. Of the 117 patients in whom the stent was removed, no recurrence was noted in 64 (25% of all cases). Overall  complications  included  migration  (9.5%),  granuloma  (7.9%) and obstruction by secretions (3.6%) justifying the practice of routine surveillance bronchoscopy. Similarly, in another 2 studies where 47 and 55  patients  underwent  stent  placement  for  PITS,  successful  stent removal  was  possible  in  47%  (22/47)  and  40%  (22/55)  patients, respectively, without need for further interventions [54,62].\nA. Agrawal et al.\nTherefore, we believe that a stent removal should be attempted to evaluate  airway  patency  as  regeneration  of  the  tracheal  cartilage  is possible and patency may be restored (Fig. 5A). While the optimal time frame for a trial of stent removal is unknown, a higher rate of success (46.8%) was described when stents remained in place for a longer time (mean of ~12 months) [54]. We thus propose a trial of stent removal at 1-year post insertion understanding that patients with recurrence may need to be reconsidered for open surgical intervention or need long term indwelling airway silicone stents.\nA  chronic  indwelling  tracheostomy  may  be  warranted  in  certain situations where patients have failed an endoscopic intervention (dilation, resection, endoluminal stent or T-tube) and are not surgical candidates for open surgery. The presence of an indwelling tracheostomy at the time of open surgery has shown worse outcomes [57] and therefore, a  multi-disciplinary  discussion  should  be  ensued  prior  to  pursuing  a tracheostomy in patients with laryngeal or tracheal strictures.",

      "content": "Benign bronchial stenosis can be isolated or associated with tracheal or laryngeal involvement. Such multifocal disease can be seen in patients as a sequelae of endobronchial tuberculosis (TB). Around 59 -65% of patients with endobronchial tuberculosis can progress to the fibrostenotic type with up to 23% of patients presenting with severe airway narrowing  [65,66].  Bronchial  stenosis  is  also  seen  post  lung  transplantation secondary to tissue ischemia and altered immune response and can occur anywhere from months to years after transplantation. Risk factors include surgical technique, anastomotic necrosis, dehiscence and infection  [67].  While  older  studies  showed  an  incidence  of  80%  in post-transplant bronchial stenosis [68], improved surgical techniques, immunosuppressive agents and peri-operative management has led to a reduced incidence (5 -30%) [69,70]. This can be severe, however, and may require stent insertion.\nSimilarly, in patients with GPA, in addition to subglottic stenosis, tracheobronchial involvement may be noted in 11 -18% of the patients [40].

      "content": "Endoscopic interventions are the mainstay of management of patients with bronchial stenosis, regardless of etiology. Treatment options include LAMD or electrocautery knife with or without stent insertion depending upon symptoms, flow limitation, extent of stenosis and the presence or absence of bronchomalacia. While the use of stents in lung transplant patients (Silicone vs SEMS) is dependent on local expertise and practice and the presence of bronchial dehiscence, we advocate for the use of endoscopic interventions with LAMD (with or without silicone stents) in patients with benign bronchial stenosis related to lung transplantation if clinically indicated [73,74]. We prefer either silicone or fully  covered  SEMS  rather  than  uncovered  SEMS  in  patients  with post-transplant stenosis and/or symptomatic bronchomalacia. A close follow up within weeks is warranted as studies of SEMS show a potentially  worsened outcomes during the long term follow up in patients with such indwelling airway stents [75]. In a study by Dutau et al., 17 patients with post-transplant bronchial strictures had 23 silicone stents inserted for anastomotic airway stenosis. Successful stent removal was achieved in 16/23 (69.5%) cases without recurrence of stenosis with a median stent duration of 266 days [76]. Patients with post-TB-fibrotic\nstrictures  have  also  been  treated  with  endoscopic  interventions  such as LAMD or balloon dilation after a electrocautery knife-assisted incision but  often  need  long-term  stenting  ( > 12 months) to maintain airway patency [10,77,78]. In patients with bronchial stenosis with connective tissue  disorders  such  as  GPA,  pharmacologic  therapy  remains  the mainstay of treatment. Endoscopic interventions with LAMD or electrocautery assisted mechanical dilation may be used in refractory patients  with  clinical  symptoms  (Fig.  5B).  Long-term  bronchoscopic surveillance is required in these patients due to the risk of recurrence and thus close outpatient follow-up is recommended.",
