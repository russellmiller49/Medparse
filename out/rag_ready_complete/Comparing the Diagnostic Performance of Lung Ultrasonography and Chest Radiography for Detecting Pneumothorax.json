      "content": "Pneumothorax, characterized by the accumulation of air within the pleural cavity, represents a serious medical emergency that can severely compromise respiratory function [1, 2]. Pneumothorax is a common condition, with a primary spontaneous incidence of 7.4/100,000 per year in males and 1.2/100,000 per year in females. The incidence of secondary spontaneous pneumothorax is 6.3/100,000 per year in males and 2.0/100,000 per year in females [3]. Traumatic pneumothorax can occur as a result of penetrating injuries (such as stabs or gunshot wounds) or blunt chest trauma [4]. Regardless of the cause, timely and accurate detection followed by immediate treatment is crucial in preventing catastrophic outcomes [5].\nBo Sheng and Lili Tao are co/uniFB01 rst authors and contributed equally to this work.\nTraditionally, chest radiography is performed on patients with chest trauma to look for pneumothorax. However, due to overlapping spinal structures and other injuries, the characteristic features of pneumothorax may not always be clearly discernible on chest radiography taken in the supine position [6, 7]. Although appropriate screening for pneumothorax via chest radiography is a crucial treatment intervention, the signs of pneumothorax on chest radiography are subtle, resulting in missed diagnoses in up to 20% of cases [8]. The reasons for these missed diagnoses may include low interobserver consistency in the interpretation of chest radiography /uniFB01 ndings and a clinical chest radiography workload that far exceeds the number of radiologists available [9, 10].\nCurrently, lung ultrasonography (US) is considered effective in detecting pneumothorax in clinical practice, especially in emergency and bedside examinations, US can quickly and noninvasively provide diagnostic information. Moreover, US exams do not involve ionizing radiation, making them safer for patients, particularly those who require frequent monitoring or speci /uniFB01 c groups such as pregnant women and children [11]. The characteristic ultrasound features of pneumothorax include the absence of lung sliding, absence of B lines, and presence of lung points, which can help diagnose pneumothorax more accurately [11]. However, whether the diagnostic performance of US is superior to that of chest radiography for detecting pneumothorax remains controversial. Thus, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the diagnostic performance of US and chest radiography for detecting pneumothorax in patients with trauma.",

Studies investigating the diagnostic performance of US and chest radiography for detecting pneumothorax were included, and the publication language was restricted to English. PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched to identify potential eligible studies from their inception until March 2023. The following search terms were used: ( ' ultrasound ' or ' sonography ' or ' ultrasonography ' or ' radiography ' or ' chest /uniFB01 lm ' or ' chest radiograph ' ) and ( ' pneumothorax ' or ' aerothorax ' ) and ( ' sensitivity ' and ' speci /uniFB01 city ' ). The reference lists of relevant studies and reviews were manually reviewed to identify further eligible studies.\nTwo reviewers independently performed the literature search and study selection, and con /uniFB02 icts between reviewers were resolved via mutual discussion until a consensus was reached. Studies were included if they met the following criteria: (1) patients: trauma patients at risk of pneumothorax in the emergency department setting; (2) diagnostic tool: US and chest radiography; (3) outcomes: true- and false-positive data and true- and falsenegative data; and (4) study design: not restricted.",

Subsequently, the ratio of diagnostic parameters for detecting pneumothorax using US and chest radiography was calculated using the random-effects model [14, 15, 18]. Subgroup analyses were performed for sensitivity, speci /uniFB01 city, PLR, NLR, DOR, and AUC based on region (Eastern and Western countries), operator (physician, radiologist, and surgeon), and sampling (consecutive and nonconsecutive sampling). Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Deeks ' asymmetry tests [19]. The p value for pooled conclusions was two-sided, and the inspection level was set at 0.05.

      "content": "This study compared the diagnostic performance of US and chest radiography for detecting pneumothorax. The overall methodological quality of the included studies was\nmoderate-to-high, and computed tomography was considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of pneumothorax [20 -40]. In total, 4,087 patients with trauma were identi /uniFB01 ed from 21 studies, and the characteristics of the patients varied across the studies. This study revealed that\nUS was associated with a higher sensitivity and AUC for detecting pneumothorax compared with chest radiography. Moreover, the NLR of US was lower than that of chest radiography. However, the speci /uniFB01 city, PLR, diagnostic score, and DOR of US and chest radiography for detecting pneumothorax showed no statistically signi /uniFB01 cant difference.\nSeveral systematic reviews and meta-analyses have previously addressed the diagnostic performance of US and chest radiography for detecting pneumothorax [41 -43]. Alrajab et al. [41] conducted a meta-analysis involving 13 articles and reported that US was more accurate than chest radiography for detecting pneumothorax; however, this study analyzed patients in trauma and nontrauma settings. A Cochrane review included nine studies and reported that the diagnostic performance of US by frontline nonradiologist physicians was better than via supine chest radiography for detecting pneumothorax in patients with trauma admitted to the emergency department [42]. Ron et al. [43] analyzed 17 studies and revealed that US showed improved sensitivity for detecting pneumothorax compared with chest radiography. However, several limitations of these previous meta-analyses must be addressed: (1) the disease states varied across the studies, including both trauma and nontrauma settings, and (2) all included studies did not provide direct comparison results for the diagnostic performance of US and chest radiography for detecting pneumothorax.\nThe current study revealed that the diagnostic performance of US was better than that of chest radiography for detecting pneumothorax in patients with trauma, revealing higher sensitivity, higher AUC, and lower NLR of the former method. The diagnostic value of US and chest radiography for detecting pneumothorax varied across the included studies, which could be explained by operator expertise and physicians employed at different academic institutions [44]. Moreover, pneumothorax could be misdiagnosed via chest radiography, especially in patients with severe injuries and those who could not be placed in an erect position.\nSubgroup analyses revealed that the sensitivity and AUC of US were higher than those of chest radiography, whereas the NLR of US was lower than that of chest radiography for detecting pneumothorax in all subgroups. Moreover, US had a higher DOR than chest radiography when studies were pooled according to location (eastern countries) and operator (radiologists). These results may be due to the following reasons: (1) signi /uniFB01 cant variability in diagnostic performance across the included studies in speci /uniFB01 c subgroups could affect the 95% CI of the pooled-effect estimates; (2) the number of studies in different subgroups varied, and the robustness of the pooled conclusions may be affected; (3) operator expertise and disease status varied across countries; and (4) the accuracy of US and chest radiography was higher when assessed by radiologists.\nThis study has several limitations. First, it included both prospective and retrospective studies, and the results may have been affected by selection and confounding biases. Second, the disease status was different across the included studies, which could affect the diagnostic performance of US and chest radiography. Third, substantial heterogeneity was noted across the included studies, which was not fully explained via subgroup analyses. Fourth, the analysis was based on published articles and previously pooled data, leading to restricted detailed analyses and inevitable publication bias.\nIn conclusion, this study revealed that the diagnostic performance of US is relatively better than that of chest radiography for detecting pneumothorax in patients with trauma, with a higher sensitivity, AUC, and lower NLR. Moreover, the DOR of US and chest radiography for detecting pneumothorax could be affected by the region and operator, and the detection rate is highly dependent on the technical expertise of the operator. Therefore, after appropriate operator training, US may be recommended for diagnosing pneumothorax in patients with trauma in clinical practice.",
