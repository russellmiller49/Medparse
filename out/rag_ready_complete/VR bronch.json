Virtual reality (VR) can show anatomy from the perspective of bronchoscopic tools. RESEARCH QUESTION: Does the use of a VR anatomy trainer for teaching EBUS-associated anatomy improve procedural performance compared with traditional methods? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In this randomized, crossover study design, participants studied EBUS-related anatomy during 2 sequential sessions using a VR trainer and a traditional modality (2-dimensional pictures or a 3-dimensional model). An EBUS simulator was used to test performance at baseline and following each training session. User experience and preferences were evaluated by using a mixed-methods approach of surveys and interviews. Spatial reasoning ability was measured by using the Mental Rotation Test. RESULTS: Sixty-eight fellows and residents at 3 institutions completed the study. All 3 learning methods improved EBUS performance significantly following the first, but not second, learning session. Learners spent more time (1.37 minutes) with VR, but no training method produced a greater improvement. Spatial reasoning ability was associated with improved EBUS performance. This impact was modified by training method: the VR approach leveled the impact of baseline spatial reasoning. The VR approach was preferred by 96% of learners. Qualitative data revealed a positive VR user experience with focused anatomy learning, ease of use, acceptable realism, and tolerance. This novel \"inside-looking-out\" perspective helped learners understand anatomy from the vantage of procedural tools and to create a mental map, but interpreting ultrasound remained challenging.

Traditional teaching approaches have used an ' outside-looking-in ' perspective with diagrams, models, and cadaveric dissection. This perspective translates naturally to surgical procedures in which an operator uses an outside-looking-in perspective with their own eyes and tools entering from outside the body.\nDevelopments in bronchoscopy have advanced our ability to diagnose respiratory disease. 1,2 Endoscopic procedures require a different approach to anatomy,\nwith the proceduralist viewing structures from the perspective of their instrument; that is, from the ' inside looking out. ' For learners using 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) learning materials, this requires them to mentally rotate anatomic structures to visualize their location from the perspective of their scope.\nEndobronchial ultrasound (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)) is a bronchoscopic method to visualize and guide sampling of airwayadjacent lymph nodes and lesions. Mediastinal lymph node stations have boundaries that are determined by vascular structures. This requires an Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) operator to correctly recognize vascular structures to then identify a lymph node station and apply the appropriate lung cancer stage to a patient. Anatomic understanding and correct landmark identi /uniFB01 cation are thus crucial components for procedural competence but ones that are challenging to learn. 3,4\nVirtual reality (VR) is a promising approach for anatomy instruction with demonstrated bene /uniFB01 ts for learners related to the presentation of 3D spatial relationships with stereoscopic vision and interactive learning. 5-9 With broad capability in the way visual information is portrayed, VR can provide a novel perspective on anatomy for endoscopic procedures. We developed a VR anatomy trainer that allows users to see anatomic structures from the perspective of being inside the airway. The goal of the current study was to assess the impact of teaching Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-related anatomy using this ' inside-looking-out ' perspective compared with traditional approaches.",

      "content": "This study used a randomized, crossover design and a mixed-methods approach to explore the impact of training materials on anatomy learning (Fig 2). Participants completed a pre-session survey about demographic characteristics, prior Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) experience, selfassessed spatial learning ability, and anticipated learning modality preference. Self-assessed knowledge and con /uniFB01 -dence in ability to identify vasculature and nodal stations were assessed (5-point Likert scale; 1 ¼ strongly disagree; 5 ¼ strongly agree). To objectively assess participant spatial reasoning skills, we used the validated redrawn Vandenberg and Kuse Mental Rotation Test\n(MRT), which has been associated with anatomy learning and procedural performance. 10-12 The MRT was administered according to published recommendations and scored from 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating better spatial reasoning ability. 13\nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) anatomy performance was assessed at baseline (Pre-Test), after which participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 fashion to one anatomy learning modality for the /uniFB01 rst learning session (Learning 1): 2D, 3D, or VR. Lymph node station anatomic boundaries were provided. Learning was self-paced, and time spent in Learning 1 was recorded. Following Learning 1, participants completed Post-Test 1 of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) anatomy performance. Those randomized to the 2D or 3D modality for Learning 1 then used VR for Learning 2; those initially randomized to VR were randomly assigned the 2D or 3D method for Learning 2. The procedures for Learning 1 and Post-Test 1 were repeated for Learning 2 and Post-Test 2, respectively.\nB\nC\n]\nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) anatomy performance was assessed using questions from the validated Endobronchial Ultrasound Skills and Tasks Assessment Tool (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-STAT) pertaining to anatomy identi /uniFB01 cation (items 4 and 5). 14 Participants ' identi /uniFB01 cation of anatomic structures was scored according to the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-STAT convention; time to identi /uniFB01 cation was recorded for correctly identi /uniFB01 ed structures. There was a maximum 35 points available: 15 for lymph node anatomy (5 points per station, 3 assessed) and 20 for vascular anatomy (4 points per structure, 5 assessed). The assessment was performed by using the Simbionix BRONCH Mentor (Surgical Science), Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) Case 6.\nFollowing Post-Test 2, participants completed a postsession survey with the same self-assessment questions, plus questions about learning modalities. The postsession survey was followed by an interview about their VR anatomy trainer learning experience (e-Appendix 1).",

      "content": "Primary analyses consisted of a mixed model with subject-level random intercepts and post-training score as the outcome. The /uniFB01 xed effects included most recent training method (our primary explanatory variable), time point (Post 1 vs Post 2), and pre-training score (centered about its sample mean). The effect of interest was measured as the expected change in Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) score for VR compared with the 2D or 3D method, controlling for pre-score and time point. We used this model ' s intercept to estimate the predicted score following each learning\nmethod for a participant with a mean pre-training score. We then investigated secondary research questions by adding additional /uniFB01 xed effects to explore whether level of training (resident vs fellow), number of procedures, time point, or mental rotation capacity modi /uniFB01 ed the effect of the learning modality. For MRT, Akaike information criterion was used to guide a simpli /uniFB01 cation of the model parameterization wherein groups were compared prior to and following VR training rather than by most recent training method.\nTo assess the impact of learning modality on time to provision of correct response, a similar mixed model was estimated with the (logged) time to provision of correct response as the outcome and additional /uniFB01 xed effects accounting for pretraining response times and assessment type (vascular vs lymph nodes). A mixed-model of time spent in learning modality with random intercepts and a /uniFB01 xed-effect for learning modality assessed whether participants spent more time in VR compared with the 2D or 3D modality.\nThe change in knowledge and con /uniFB01 dence scores that occurred between learning periods was evaluated by using Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The relationship of itemspeci /uniFB01 c con /uniFB01 dence and perceived knowledge to actual item-level learning was assessed by using 6 mixed models with subject-level random intercepts, one for each combination of assessment type and measure of con /uniFB01 dence and perceived knowledge. Each model includes pretraining score and a measure of con /uniFB01 dence\nor perceived knowledge level as predictors. Pairwise McNemar tests were used to compare learning modality preferences prior to and following assessment, and to compare these preferences with each individual ' s stated ' best ' modality.\nTo assess the qualitative experience of the training modalities, all individuals participated in a recorded semistructured in-person interview. These were conducted by 1 of 3 researchers and were tailored to evaluate the user learning experience. These were transcribed and all identifying information removed. A preliminary codebook was created by 2 authors (T. A. and M. L.\nN.) who independently identi /uniFB01 ed emerging concepts and codes. Saturation of codes was achieved after reviewing 15% of the transcripts. Each transcript was independently analyzed by the same 2 authors (T. A. and M. L. N.), who then met to discuss and resolve any coding discrepancies. These codes were then analyzed using the qualitative software NVivo 14 (QSR International) to develop themes and subthemes.\nBecause no formal sample size justi /uniFB01 cation was performed, we produced 95% pro /uniFB01 le likelihood CIs for all reported model-based estimates and acknowledge that tests for effect moderation may suffer from low power.",

Learners scored a median of 14 (interquartile range, 18) on the pre-session Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) assessment and had a median MRT score of 9.5 (interquartile range, 5).\nPrior to the learning session, 19 (28%) participants agreed with the sentiment ' I know how to identify mediastinal vascular structures using Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), ' and 27 (40%) agreed with the statement ' I know how to identify mediastinal lymph node stations using Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS). ' Following the session, 53 (78%) and 56 (82%) learners agreed with those statements, respectively (e-Table 1). Self-assessed improvement in knowledge and con /uniFB01 dence was statistically signi /uniFB01 cant for each question ( P < .0001). Prior to being exposed to any learning methods, 45 (66%) said they would prefer to learn via VR. After being exposed to both VR and non-VR learning methods, 64 (96%) learners said they preferred learning via VR, and 64 (96%) stated a preference to use VR for learning anatomy for other types of procedures.\nAll three learning methods (2D, 3D, and VR) produced higher Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-STAT scores following the /uniFB01 rst learning\nsession (Fig 3). The results from the primary mixed model indicated that adjusted for pre-score and time point, there was no evidence of a difference between learning methods (a mean difference of -1.0 point; 95% CI, -3.03 to 0.97; P ¼ .32). However, both learning methods saw signi /uniFB01 cantly improved outcomes following learning; for someone with an average pre-score of 14.6, the expected score following the /uniFB01 rst 2D/3D learning session was 21.6 points (95% CI, 19.7 to 23.4), and 20.6 points after the /uniFB01 rst VR learning session (95% CI, 18.4 to 22.8).\nThe MRT score was highly associated with Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) scores, but this effect was signi /uniFB01 cantly modi /uniFB01 ed by training method. Speci /uniFB01 cally, adjusting for pre-score and learning session, for individuals who had yet to receive VR training (ie, had only received 2D or 3D training), each additional point in the MRT score was associated with a 0.88-point increase in post-training Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) score (95% CI, 0.49 to 1.28). This association was signi /uniFB01 cantly reduced by 0.59 (95% CI, -1.04 to -0.16) following VR training, after which the association became 0.29 and was no longer signi /uniFB01 cant (95% CI, -0.06 to 0.64) (Fig 4).",

Similarly, those who responded positively regarding their post-learning knowledge of vascular structures had a 3.42 higher vascular score than those who responded neutrally (95% CI, 0.22-6.63). We found no evidence of an association between item-speci /uniFB01 c knowledge and con /uniFB01 dence and change in lymph node scores.\nQualitative analysis of focused interviews revealed several themes: the experience of using the VR anatomy trainer; the impact of learning with the bronchoscopic perspective; creation of an anatomical ' mental map ' ; the additional challenge of the ultrasound view; and recommendations for educational use (Table 2). In general, users reported a favorable experience with the VR trainer. They found it easy to use, even for those without prior VR experience; few participants reported motion sickness with using VR. Participants found the airway view to appear realistic: ' It felt like I was actually seeing what I saw on the screen of the bronchoscope. But then, plus . . . it was seeing through the walls, which was nice. '\nThe perspective of being inside the airway was often noted as the reason for the perceived bene /uniFB01 t of and preference for the VR anatomy trainer. This vantage point ' avoided having to rotate things in your mind, it was sort of already in the layout that you ' re used to. ' Users found this particularly bene /uniFB01 cial regarding vascular anatomy, that the VR ' gives you a better sense of trajectory and how they wrap around ' and allowed users to create a mental map to apply to subsequent Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) attempts. Some found the use of a combination of perspectives to be helpful, using a 3D model along with the VR trainer to provide a more comprehensive anatomic understanding. Many cited the additional challenge of using and interpreting ultrasound because ' it ' s like Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) is its own step further ' ; participants recommended inclusion of an ultrasound view in the VR trainer. The bene /uniFB01 t of isolating anatomy learning from other procedural skills was noted: ' If you did separate those 2 things, then you would be able to teach the procedural skill potentially a little bit easier if people weren ' t focusing on learning multiple things at once.

      "content": "VR and other forms of extended reality have a growing role in anatomy education. 5,8,9,15 Although VR and extended reality can take many forms, we are the /uniFB01 rst, to our knowledge, to create and test a VR program that provides procedural anatomy training from the perspective of bronchoscopic instruments, from the inside-looking-out. Our mixed methods data provide an in-depth understanding of the differences and bene /uniFB01 ts to using this novel approach to learn Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-relevant anatomy compared with traditional anatomy teaching methods. We found VR to be as effective as traditional methods, while possibly improving learning for those with poorer baseline spatial reasoning ability.\nWhen learning with traditional outside-looking-in 2D and 3D approaches, the amount of procedural improvement learners demonstrated correlated with spatial reasoning: learners with higher spatial reasoning ability had greater improvement in procedural performance. The impact of spatial reasoning ability on Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) improvement was mitigated when VR was used as a learning modality; the inside-looking-out perspective allowed equitable learning of anatomy irrespective of spatial reasoning ability. Our qualitative data complement this /uniFB01 nding: many participants discussed the dif /uniFB01 culty of mentally rotating structures to picture anatomy from another perspective and the bene /uniFB01 t of the VR trainer to facilitate this. Others appreciated the integration of the outside-looking-in perspective with the inside-looking-out view to better understand the interaction of anatomic structures. These /uniFB01 ndings of varied anatomy learning preferences and differential bene /uniFB01 ts based on spatial reasoning ability raise the prospect of personalized education within procedural teaching.\nFrom a learner perspective, there was an overwhelming preference for the VR anatomy trainer. Seeing anatomy from a procedural viewpoint was useful to many participants and was repeatedly cited as the reason for VR trainer preference. The VR trainer helped to create a ' mental map, ' such that when doing a procedure, they could picture the location of vascular structures surrounding the airways, something they had been unable to accomplish with other learning methods. Our quantitative data showed that self-assessed vascular anatomy knowledge and con /uniFB01 dence correlated with better vascular anatomy performance, which is perhaps related to learners having a better spatial sense with a ' mental map ' of the vascular structures.\n]\nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) is a complex procedure requiring the integration of multiple technical and cognitive skills. Teaching complex procedures can bene /uniFB01 t from breaking them into discrete micro skills to minimize cognitive load. 16-18 Our study is consistent with this approach of focusing on micro skills: we saw improvement in procedural skill after dedicated anatomy teaching, despite a relatively short training duration of focused self-directed learning. The bene /uniFB01 t of self-directed learning may have been limited, however, in the absence of expert guidance or performance feedback as we did not see signi /uniFB01 cant improvement on the second post-test compared with the /uniFB01 rst.\nParticipants highlighted the bene /uniFB01 t of focusing on learning anatomy independent of other procedural components but raised an additional challenge in applying anatomy learning to procedural performance: ultrasound image interpretation. Unprompted, participants repeatedly brought this up as a challenge, as well as a potential way to improve the VR anatomy trainer learning experience. Although we deliberately focused on learner interaction with anatomy teaching methods and chose not to incorporate ultrasound teaching into the current study, an interactive ultrasound view is a feasible addition to the VR anatomy trainer.\nIncreased accessibility and portability are a bene /uniFB01 t of VR. Our participants reported they would use VR anatomy training prior to clinical bronchoscopy experiences, such as ' just-in-time ' retraining. We intentionally developed our VR program to be compatible with the Oculus headset, which does not require a computer for use and has a lower price relative to other VR headsets, as cost is an important barrier to educational material dissemination.\nThe current study has numerous strengths, including being a multisite study with a sample size comparable to or exceeding previous bronchoscopy educational studies. 3,19 Our decision to enroll trainees interested in bronchoscopy further increases relevance and generalizability. Our assessment of spatial ability used a validated tool with relevance to anatomy learning and the speci /uniFB01 c task required to apply anatomy learning to procedural performance. In addition to subjective outcomes, the validated Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-STAT tool was used for\nobjective assessment. The mixed-methods approach provides a comprehensive and rich exploration of this novel anatomy trainer.\nOne limitation is that outcomes were of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) performance on a simulator, not patient-level outcomes. However, the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-STAT can be used in the simulation setting, as in prior Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) educational studies. 3,14,20 The current study outcomes were assessed immediately following training, and thus long-term impact on skill retention remains uncertain. In addition, we chose to simply provide learning materials rather than to direct a learning or procedural method. This differs from an Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) educational approach used by some, a stepwise sequence of speci /uniFB01 c ultrasound views. 21 Differences between these approaches to teaching procedural anatomy have not been explored and can be the subject of future work. Comprehensive Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) skill assessment includes elements beyond anatomy, including bronchoscope manipulation and transbronchial needle aspiration, among other skills; these were not included in the current anatomy-focused study, although they are important clinically. Some of our tests for effect modi /uniFB01 cation were limited by low subgroup sample size; additional research would be bene /uniFB01 cial to validate our results.",

      "content": "Dedicated Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-related procedural anatomy teaching improved the ability of learners to correctly identify anatomic structures. Use of a VR anatomy trainer provided an inside-looking-out view that was preferred by learners given its alignment with the procedural perspective. Although bene /uniFB01 t from traditional anatomy learning methods correlated with spatial reasoning skill, this novel approach helped learners of all spatial reasoning abilities to improve their procedural performance.",
