Given the effectiveness of treating early-phase empyema with a chest tube and intrapleural use of t-PA and DNase, as well as the use of VATS to reduce length of hospital stay, the authors developed a multidisciplinary protocol with general thoracic surgery and interventional pulmonary medicine for the algorithmic care of patients presenting with empyema, starting with a small-bore chest tube placement followed by intrapleural use of t-PA and DNase. If this initial step is unsuccessful, the next stage of the pathway is thoracic surgical consultation for VATS decortication ( Figure 1 ).",

A randomized clinical trial by Hussain et al 16 identified similar findings of a reduction in drainage duration and hospital stay with small-bore pigtail catheters compared with large-bore chest tubes in patients with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. The most prominent advantage of a small-bore chest tube is its size, which allows for a smaller incision and decreased pain experienced by the patient. 16,17 The randomized clinical trial by Kulvatunyou et al 17 demonstrated a lowerpainscoreinindividualswithapigtailcathetercomparedwith alarge-bore chest tube for traumatic pneumothorax.

For an apical pneumothorax, a chest tube can be placed in the second intercostal space in the midclavicular line, although less comfortable for the patient, and adequate drainage of an unloculated pneumothorax can be performed via lateral insertion at the fifth intercostal space. 14,18 If the tube is placed in the triangle of safety, it is important to place it in a line anterior to the anterior superior iliac spine. Placing in the tube in a line behind this surface landmark may cause the patient to lie on the tube when in the supine position and mechanically occlude thetube.Forapleuraleffusion,alowerintercostalspacemaybeused for insertion but special care must be taken to avoid penetrating the diaphragm, and subsequently the liver on the right and spleen and bowel on the left. 13\nThe 3 ways to insert a chest tube are dissective, Seldinger (often ultrasonography guided), and the trocar technique, again often ultrasonography guided. 13,14,19,20 Ultrasonography can be an invaluable tool to safely identify internal landmarks for chest tube placement. Figure 3 presents a representative sonographic image demonstratingthetargetabnormalcollectionofpleuralfluid,inthe right chest, for chest tube drainage, and adjacent structures of atelectatic lung, diaphragm and liver. Figure 4 Ahighlights an important step for chest tube placement, which is using a finder needle (often a syringe with local anesthetic) just above the target rib to avoid the intercostal neurovascular bundle and aspirating the pleural space to confirm the location of the pleural pathology. For dissective insertion, a 1- to 2-cm incision is made overlying the rib of choice (the authors do not tunnel to a rib above), a Schnidt tonsil clamp is used to bluntly dissect through the subcutaneous tissue, the3muscularlayersoftheintercostalspace(ie, the external intercostal muscle, the internal intercostal muscle, and innermost intercostal muscle), transthoracic fascia, and the parietal pleural until the clamp enters the pleural cavity. When attempting to enter the fifth intercostal space, it is important to dissect not perpendicular to the chestwall,butgenerallyposteriorandapical,thedirectionthatmost tubesshouldbeplaced(Figure4B).Dissectingperpendiculartothe chest wall and into the fifth intercostal space can lead to the tube heading directly into the oblique fissure, and then be entrapped by the subsequent expanded lung, rendering the tube ineffective after lung expansion.Aftersuccessfulspreadingintothepleuraspace, afinger is used to confirm entry into the pleural space and the presence of adhesions. Adhesions are not bluntly broken with the finger, as pleural adhesions are often vascular and blunt dissection can\nlead to small vessel disruption and subsequently hemothorax. 13,14 The Seldinger technique uses guidewires and tract dilators to assist the tube into the pleural cavity, all under ultrasonography guidance. 19,21 Lastly, the trocar method may be used; however, it is associatedwithmorecomplicationsowingtotherigidtipofthetrocar causing intrathoracic injuries and has subsequently fallen out of favorforchesttubeinsertion. 19,20,22 Regardlessoftheinsertiontechnique, the chest tube needs to be advanced on the superior edge of the rib to avoid the neurovascular bundle bordering the rib above. 13,14 It should also be positioned posteriorly and advanced until the tip is in a posteroapical location. The tube should also be fully inserted to ensure that the most proximal (sentinel) hole is within thepleuralspacetoallowthechesttubetofunctionproperly. 14 Lastly, it is important to secure the chest tube with a suture to prevent it from falling out.

The phrase 'place a chest tube on water seal' is a misnomer, as modern PDUs have a constitutive water seal chamber that serves asa1-wayvalve,preventingairfromreturningintothepleuralspace; placing a chest tube on water seal simply means taking the tube off active suction. The randomized clinical trial by Cerfolio et al 26 found that water sealing the chest tube on postoperative day 2 after thoracic surgery resulted in a significant resolution of small air leak the following day, with the authors noting that large air leaks donotbenefitfromwatersealing.Anotherrandomizedclinicaltrial 27 demonstrated similar results of a shorter duration of air leak with early water sealing for postthoracic surgery chest tubes, which subsequently decreased the duration the chest tube was needed. Both of these studies, albeit randomized clinical trials, are limited by their small sample sizes. Brunelli et al 28 performed a randomized clinical trial with a larger sample size, did not find an advantage with water seal over suction for postthoracic surgery patients andtheauthors favor a hybrid approach of moderate suction overnight and water sealing during the day to allow for mobilization of the patient. The systematic review and meta-analysis by Coughlin et al 29 determinedthattherewasnoadvantageofsuctionoverwater seal after thoracic surgery, with the exception of suction being superior to water seal in preventing a radiographic identification of pneumothoraces.\nFor patients with a traumatic chest injury, the systemic review and meta-analysis by Feenstra et al 9 demonstrated evidence that favors low-pressure suction over water seal. This meta-analysis is limited in the number of studies, and therefore patient sample size, included. In addition, there are few patients with chest tubes in the setting of mechanical ventilation included in this study, which is an important subset of trauma patients. Patients who have an occult pneumothoraxandarereceivingpositivepressuremechanical ventilation are at risk of developing a tension pneumothorax, therefore it may be necessary for a chest tube to be placed on suction in this subset of patients. 30 Overall, the managementofachest tube depends on the indication for insertion with evidence favor-\ning suction over water seal for both postthoracic surgery patients and traumatic chest injury patients, until resolution of air leak.",

      "content": "There are many factors that come into play when determining the correct time to remove a chest tube. The quality of the fluid should be free of chyle, or blood suggestive of active bleeding, and be nonpurulent. 31,32 However, the quantity of fluid that is acceptable before the removal of a chest tube is without consensus, with varyingrecommendedvolumethresholdsrangingfrom200mLperday to 500 mL per day. 31-33 Cerfolio et al 32 performed a retrospective cohort analysis that demonstrated that chest tube removal up to 450 mL per day was acceptable in patients who underwent elective pulmonary resection. They reported that 364 of 1988 patients (18%) were able to go home sooner owing to surgeons changing to thehigherthreshold(450mLperday)andonly11patients(0.55%) were readmitted as a result of a recurrent symptomatic effusion. Grodzkietal 34 testedthisconclusionayearlaterandremovedchest tubes at the higher threshold of 450 mL per day and found that 6 of 40 patients (15%) were readmitted with pleural effusions, thus leading the authors to revert to their original practice of following a threshold of 200 mL per day for chest tube removal. The limitation in the former study is the lack of reliable follow-up, which could account for the low readmission rate, and the limitation in the latter studyisthesmallsamplesize.Largerrandomizedclinicaltrialswould be helpful in clarifying this gap in our understanding.\nWhether to remove the chest tube at the end of expiration or inspiration is another question that has been widely debated.

The 5 complication categories proposed were insertional, positional, removal, infectious, and malfunction.
