      "title": "Initial Approach to the Diagnosis of Solitary Pulmonary Nodules",
      "content": "Once a solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN) is discovered on chest imaging (Figure 1), a decision should be made whether to pursue a tissue diagnosis. This decision must factor in radiographic characteristics of the nodule, evidence of malignant spread, the condition of the patient, patient  preferences,  and  available  local  expertise.  A multidisciplinary approach to decision-making is ideal, often involving the primary referring physician, a pulmonologist, a radiologist, and a surgeon. For intermediate or highly suspicious SPNs >8 mm, tissue sampling is often recommended, 6  with options ranging from surgical resection to nonsurgical biopsies.\nBefore the development of nonsurgical biopsy techniques, surgical resection was the only modality available to obtain a true pathologic diagnosis for an SPN. Surgery continues to remain the diagnostic gold standard  and  the  definitive  treatment  for  malignant  lung nodules.  The  available  techniques  include  video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS),  thoracotomy, and  mediastinoscopy, 6 with  VATS  being  less  invasive than thoracotomy and having low absolute complication rates. 7  Furthermore, unlike nonoperative biopsies,\nsurgical resection is both diagnostic and potentially therapeutic. Diagnosis is often obtained on-site via frozen section analysis. If malignancy is confirmed, therapeutic  lobectomy  with  mediastinal  lymphadenectomy is pursued. 6\nAlthough surgery combines diagnosis and treatment  into  one  procedure,  this  is  best  avoided  for nonmalignant  SPNs  or  nonoperable  malignancies. As such, less invasive bronchoscopic and percutaneous biopsies can help confirm or rule out malignancies.  before resection. These modalities are especially important for factors that make surgery more challenging, such as poor surgical candidates or nodules that are small, centrally located, or subsolid. 6\nRecent  guidelines  recommend  that  decisionmaking  regarding  the  initial  diagnostic  modality (surgical vs nonsurgical) for SPNs should rely on the pretest probability of malignancy: surgical diagnosis when the clinical probability of malignancy is high (>65%)  and  nonsurgical  biopsy  when  the  clinical pretest probability is low to moderate (≈10%-60%). 6\nAlthough  this  review  focuses  on  the  different bronchoscopic  techniques  in  the  nonoperative  diagnosis and staging of lung cancer, percutaneous biopsy, by fluoroscopy, ultrasound, or CT guidance, is another nonsurgical option. A recent meta-analysis has  demonstrated  pooled  sensitivity  of  CT-guided TTNA to be 90%, with individual study estimates ranging from 62% to 99%. 8  Although sensitivity is high, TTNA carries a risk of iatrogenic pneumothorax, with rates ranging from 15% to 44% 9,10 ; this is\ncompared with a lower risk of pneumothoraces (2%8%)  following  bronchoscopic  biopsies. 10 Furthermore, as a point of comparison, staging of the mediastinal lymph nodes and performing an airway evaluation requires a separate procedure when TTNA is performed,  but  is  often  performed  concomitantly with peripheral bronchoscopic biopsies.",

      "content": "Recent  technological  advances  within  the  past  15 years have allowed advanced bronchoscopy to play a prominent role in the diagnosis of early-stage lung cancer with low risk to the patient.\nBecause most SPNs cannot be directly visualized by basic flexible bronchoscopy, guidance techniques have been used to help guide biopsy tools to a target lesion.  The  earliest  developed  guidance  technique was fluoroscopy, which provides real-time radiologic imaging of the lungs, bronchoscope, and biopsy tools during the procedure. Unfortunately, its major limitations include that it provides an image of the bronchi that is low resolution and allows a limited 2-dimensional  (2D),  rather  than  3-dimensional  (3D), view of the lungs. As a result, the sensitivity in the diagnosis of a SPN via conventional bronchoscopy with fluoroscopy has been low (≈33%), especially for smaller nodules <2 cm in diameter. 11,12\nBecause 30% of early-stage lung cancers are in the peripheral one-third of the lung, 8,13,14 a region beyond where more standard bronchoscopes can reach, ultrathin scopes were developed to help access these peripheral lesions. 15,16 Nevertheless, yields remained low and nondiagnostic bronchoscopies often required confirmation via additional procedures, such as CTguided TTNA and surgical resection.\nTwo  newer  guidance  techniques,  navigational bronchoscopy (NB) and radial endobronchial ultrasound  (r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)),  have  been  developed  with  hopes of  significantly  improving  the  diagnostic  yield  of bronchoscopy for SPNs.",

      "title": "Navigational Bronchoscopy",
      "content": "NB was established in the mid-2000s to improve the accuracy  of  reaching  small  peripheral  lesions  under bronchoscopy. NB uses either virtual bronchoscopic navigation  (VBN)  or  electromagnetic  navigation (ENB). With VBN, a computer algorithm creates a\nvirtual  airway  map  based  on  the  patient's  CT  scan. During  bronchoscopy,  at  each  airway  bifurcation, the  bronchoscopist  is  directed  to  the  airway  that will  eventually lead to the lesion in question. With this technique, there is no real-time guidance of instruments. ENB, on the other hand, uses an electromagnetic (EM) field generator to create an EM field centered  around  the  patient. 17 This  field  generates current within sensor coils embedded in various locator  instruments that are inserted through the working channel of the bronchoscope. The EM field tracks these microsensors, determining their real-time position in space within the field. Pixels from a prior 2D high-resolution CT scan can be merged together to construct 3D cubes, called voxels, which then recreate a 3D CT image (a 'virtual CT') of various body structures in the thorax (Figures 2 and 3). This digital 3D image is superimposed over the EM field. Sensed instruments can then be guided to a target lesion based on 2 factors: positioning information provided from the sensor within the EM field, and mapping information created by the superimposed 3D CT image. 18",

Linear Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)  provides  a  sonographic  view  that  is  parallel to the long axis of the bronchoscope and allows for real-time visualization for needle aspiration of lymph nodes,  whereas  r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)  provides  a  360°  ultrasound view (Figure 5) and is generally used to identify nodules  and  masses  within  the  parenchyma. 19   r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) allows for visual confirmation that the target has actually been reached.

      "title": "Yields of Guided Bronchoscopy Techniques",
      "content": "Until recently, data have been scarce in comparing the diagnostic yields of these newer bronchoscopic technologies. In 2012, a large meta-analysis of >3,000 cases found that the weighted diagnostic yield of all advanced  bronchoscopic  techniques  was  reasonably  high  (70.0%;  95% CI, 67.1%-72.9%), with a significantly  lower  risk  of  pneumothorax  compared with TTNA (1.5% vs 25%). 10  Another study found that the combination of r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and NB performed during the same procedure increased the yield compared with either used alone. 20 Overall higher yields from  bronchoscopic  transbronchial  needle  aspiration  (TBNA) have been associated with larger lesion size (>2 cm), nonupper lobe location, tobacco\nuse,  and  more  centrally  located  lesions. 10,21 Use  of rapid on-site cytopathology evaluation (ROSE) has also been shown to increase accuracy and diagnostic yield among bronchoscopic biopsies. 22,23\nMore recently, a large multicenter registry study reported  disappointing  lower  overall  yields  for  rEBUS  and  NB  of  53.7%. 21   However,  newer  NB technologies have been developed with hopes of improving accuracy and yield. 2,24  An example of one of these  newer  navigational  technologies  incorporate EM guidance tracking directly into sampling tools as well as into a specialized transthoracic needle. 2 This allows for tracking of the sampling tools at time of biopsy without the need for a guide sheath, and also permits  the  performance  of  an  EM-guided  TTNA during the same procedure. The yield of a combined EM-guided bronchoscopic and TTNA biopsy in one pilot study of 24 patients was 87%, which increased to 92% when linear Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) for nodal staging was also performed. 2\nIn summary, CT-guided TTNA carries a high diagnostic yield for the biopsy of peripheral lung nodules when compared with bronchoscopy, although at a significantly increased risk of pneumothorax. Of equal importance,  because  nodal  staging  plays  an  important role in the evaluation of malignant lung nodules, combining bronchoscopic staging and diagnosis into one procedure is more comprehensive and potentially more time-saving and cost-effective. On the other hand,  small  peripheral  nodules  (≤2cm)  with  a  high pretest probability for malignancy that have no radiographic evidence of nodal spread can be evaluated for surgical resection as the initial diagnostic, staging, and definitive treatment of choice. 25",

      "title": "Bronchoscopy for Nodal Staging: Linear EBUS Bronchoscopy",
      "content": "Accurate nodal staging, especially for non-small cell lung  cancer  (Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC))  without  evidence  of  metastatic  disease,  is  critical  in  guiding  treatment  options. 8,25  Stage I-IIIa Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents potentially resectable disease. 26 Historically, nodal involvement was inferred based on imaging findings with significant  false-positive  and  false-negative  rates  (Figure 6). 25 Surgical  procedures  were  introduced  to  provide  definitive  tissue  staging.  Surgical  approaches included  thoracotomy,  VATS,  Chamberlain  procedure (anterior mediastinoscopy), and cervical mediastinoscopy. 13  Mediastinoscopy continues to play an important role and, as the original 'gold standard' in  cancer  staging,  remains  a  common  modality  of\nchoice against which the utility of other techniques is  compared.  Mediastinoscopy  is  a  safe  procedure with low complication rates, but it is more invasive than  bronchoscopic  staging. 25 An  in-depth  discussion and comparison between Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscopy with  various  surgical  staging  techniques  is  beyond the  scope  of  this  review.  However,  because  operator  experience  likely  plays  a  large  role  on  the  performance  of  any  given  procedure,  and  some  nodal stations  are  accessible  by  one  approach  but  not  by another, the differing surgical and nonsurgical staging  modalities  should  be  viewed  as  complimentary rather than competitive.\nDeveloped in the 1990s, linear Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscopy has revolutionized the nodal staging of lung cancer by providing a minimally invasive diagnostic alternative to surgery (Figures 7 and 8). Before Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) technology,  bronchoscopic  biopsies  of  the  mediastinal lymph nodes were performed using conventional ('blind') TBNA. The needle insertion site was based on anatomic landmarks and review of prior imaging. 27 Although there is wide variability,  diagnostic  yields for conventional TBNA have historically been low. 25 Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, which allows the real-time visualization of mediastinal lymph nodes (Figure 9), has shown significantly higher diagnostic yields. 28\nThe most common indication for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscopy is for the nodal staging of Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), when suspicious  mediastinal  and  hilar  lymph  nodes  are seen on imaging. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) is able to access lymph node stations 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 11, and potentially 12 per the International  Association  for  the  Study  of  Lung Cancer  lymph  node  map. 29   Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA alone  is often  unable  to  sample  nodal  stations  5,  6,  8,  and 9. 30 The  addition  of  esophageal  ultrasound  (EUS)\nduring  the  same  procedure  allows  sampling  of  stations 5, 8, and 9. 30  Therefore, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), with or without EUS, provides a very comprehensive evaluation of thoracic lymph nodes. Comparatively, cervical mediastinoscopy can access nodal stations 1, 2, 3, 4, anterior 7, and potentially 10. 30  When combined with a Chamberlain procedure or a left VATS, station 5 and 6 can be accessed. 31\nIn  a  systematic  approach  by  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)  staging  for suspected Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the highest N stage nodal station >5  mm  should  be  sampled  first  to  avoid  contamination  of  a  higher-stage  node  when  using  a  single needle. 32 If  ROSE is available, further biopsies can be avoided once the highest stage nodal station confirms malignancy. If ROSE is unavailable, or if biopsy passes reveal no malignancy on-site, then evaluation and sampling from at least 4R, 7, and 4L nodal stations  should  be  attempted. 32 It  has  been  recommended that a minimum of 3 passes be performed per nodal station. 33\nSeveral meta-analyses have reported a pooled sensitivity of 88% to 93% for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA mediastinal staging of lung cancer, with results significantly dependent on prevalence of  disease. 34-36 This  is  compared with meta-analysis of cervical mediastinoscopy, with sensitivities ranging from 70% to 92%. 37-39 In  one  prospective  study,  153  patients  underwent Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA followed by mediastinoscopy. 40  There was  excellent  agreement  among  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA  results and mediastinoscopy for staging N2/N3 nodes. The sensitivity, negative predictive value (NPV), and diagnostic accuracy were similar between the groups (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA: 81%, 91%, and 93%, respectively, vs mediastinoscopy: 79%, 90%, and 93%, respectively).\nOne randomized controlled trial of 241 patients compared mediastinoscopy alone with Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)/EUSFNA followed by mediastinoscopy if the needle approach was negative. 41 All patients without identified mediastinal  involvement  subsequently  underwent thoracotomy. There was no difference in sensitivity or  NPV in either arm. The combination approach (endosonography  followed  by  surgical  staging)  detected significantly more mediastinal nodal involvement than mediastinoscopy alone. However, in those undergoing Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)/EUS, a reduction was seen in the need for mediastinoscopy. This study concluded that staging  should  start  with  endosonography  and,  if negative, move to surgical staging.

Recent guidelines have suggested that patients with a peripheral clinical stage IA tumor (≤2 cm) do not require invasive mediastinal staging. 25 In 2008, Herth et al 42 performed a prospective study of 97 patients with clinical stage I disease and normal lymph nodes on chest CT undergoing Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA. All patients subsequently underwent mediastinoscopy. Nine patients had nodal\nspread  despite  normal  imaging.  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)  identified  almost all (8 of 9) of these patients, some of whom had N2 and N3 disease. This study concluded that potentially operable patients with clinical stage I lung cancer may benefit from presurgical staging with EBUSTBNA and that clinical staging with imaging alone is not sufficiently reliable. Another study found similar performance  characteristics  between  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA (accuracy 91%, NPV 91%) and mediastinoscopy for radiographically normal lymph nodes, 43 thus concluding that in those with benign results from Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, diagnostic surgical staging may be omitted.\nThe utility  of  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for restaging  after induction therapy has also been evaluated. In contrast  to  remediastinoscopy,  which  may  be  technically  more  difficult  due  to  mediastinal  adhesions, 44 Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA is an easily repeatable procedure. One study  of  124  patients  presenting  for  restaging  after induction chemotherapy found Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA to be sensitive, specific, and diagnostically accurate (76%, 100%, 77%), although the NPV was low (20%). 45 Therefore,  it  was  concluded  that  tumor-negative findings  should  be  confirmed  with  surgery  prior  to thoracotomy.  Many  centers  now  use  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)  as  the initial  staging  modality,  and  if  N2  disease  is  confirmed,  proceed  with  neoadjuvant  chemotherapy and radiation, saving mediastinoscopy for restaging.\nIn addition to nodal staging, other uses for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscopy in lung cancer are for the biopsy of tumors abutting large airways, tissue diagnosis of small cell  lung  cancer,  assessment  of  tumor  border  and depth, and determining the relationship of the tumor with  its  surrounding  mediastinal  structures.  With the  advent  of  targeted  therapy  and  immunotherapies  and  the  increasing  need  for  mutational  analysis  of  the  tumor  cells,  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)  has  also  been  proven",

In  one  large  meta-analysis  of  1,299 patients, there were 2 complications: 1 major (0.07%, a pneumothorax requiring a chest tube) and 1 minor (0.07%, transient hypoxemia that resolved after the procedure). 34 Given the theoretical risk of bleeding with  any  biopsy,  therapeutic  anticoagulation  and clopidogrel should ideally be held before the procedure.  However,  it  is  safe  to  continue  aspirin. 49 Although Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscopy can be performed under moderate sedation, general anesthesia is often used to allow complete staging of all nodes >5 mm.\nOverall, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscopy provides a safe and cost-effective diagnostic tool for the staging of lung cancer.",

      "content": "Bronchoscopy in its multiple forms plays a central role  in  examining  the  airways,  reaching  suspicious lesions, and acquiring tissue for diagnosis. For lung cancer,  it  has  important  diagnostic  and  therapeutic  applications.  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)  bronchoscopy  provides  a minimally invasive alternative to surgery for nodal staging  with  high  diagnostic  accuracy.  Although conventional  bronchoscopy  allows  for  easy  biopsy of  central  airway  lesions,  most  lung  nodules  are  in the periphery and not accessible using the standard bronchoscope. Adjunctive guidance tools, such as r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and NB, have been developed to aid in reaching these peripheral target lesions with significantly improved diagnostic yields. Combining these multiple  techniques  into  one  procedure  (ie,  nodal staging with linear Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) followed by sampling of a nodule with r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and NB) may potentially offer a comprehensive evaluation for lung cancer and nodal staging with minimal complications.\n13.
