The combination of endobronchial ultrasound with real-time guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) and endoscopic (esophageal) ultrasound with fine needle aspiration, with use of a gastrointestinal (EUS-FNA) or EBUS (EUS-B-FNA) scope, is preferred over either test alone (Recommendation grade C). If the combination of EBUS and EUS-(B) is not available, we suggest that EBUS alone is acceptable (Recommendation grade C).Subsequent surgical staging is recommended, when endosonography does not show malignant nodal involvement (Recommendation grade B). 2 For mediastinal nodal staging in patients with suspected or proven non-small-cell peripheral lung cancer without mediastinal involvement at CT or CT-PET, we suggest that EBUS-TBNA and/or EUS-(B)-FNA should be performed before therapy, provided that one or more of the following conditions is present: (i) enlarged or fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET-avid ipsilateral hilar nodes; (ii) primary tumor without FDG uptake; (iii) tumor size ≥ 3 cm (Fig. 3a - c) (Recommendation grade C). If endosonography does not show malignant nodal involvement, we suggest that mediastinoscopy is considered, especially in suspected N1 disease (Recommendation grade C).If PET is not available and CT does not reveal enlarged hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes, we suggest performance of EBUS-TBNA and/or EUS-(B)-FNA and/or surgical staging (Recommendation grade C). 3 In patients with suspected or proven < 3 cm peripheral NSCLC with normal mediastinal and hilar nodes at CT and/or PET, we suggest initiation of therapy without further mediastinal staging (Recommendation grade C). 4 For mediastinal staging in patients with centrally located suspected or proven NSCLC without mediastinal or hilar involvement at CT and/or CT-PET, we suggest performance of EBUS-TBNA, with or without EUS-(B)-FNA, in preference to surgical staging (Fig. 4) (Recommendation grade D). If endosonography does not show malignant nodal involvement, mediastinoscopy may be considered (Recommendation grade D). 5 For mediastinal nodal restaging following neoadjuvant therapy, EBUS-TBNA and/or EUS-(B)-FNA is suggested for detection of persistent nodal disease, but, if this is negative, subsequent surgical staging is indicated (Recommendation grade C). 6 A complete assessment of mediastinal and hilar nodal stations, and sampling of at least three different mediastinal nodal stations (4 R, 4 L, 7) (Fig. 1, Fig. 5) is suggested in patients with NSCLC and an abnormal mediastinum by CT or CT-PET (Recommendation grade D). 7 For diagnostic purposes, in patients with a centrally located lung tumor that is not visible at conventional bronchoscopy, endosonography is suggested, provided the tumor is located immediately adjacent to the larger airways (EBUS) or esophagus (EUS-(B)) (Recommendation grade D). 8 In patients with a left adrenal gland suspected for distant metastasis we suggest performance of endoscopic ultrasound fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) (Recommendation grade C), while the use of EUS-B with a transgastric approach is at present experimental (Recommendation grade D). 9 For optimal endosonographic staging of lung cancer, we suggest that individual endoscopists should be trained in both EBUS and EUS-B in order to perform complete endoscopic staging in one session (Recommendation grade D). 10 We suggest that new trainees in endosonography should follow a structured training curriculum consisting of simulation-based training followed by supervised practice on patients (Recommendation grade D). 11 We suggest that competency in EBUS-TBNA and EUS-(B)-FNA for staging lung cancer be assessed using available validated assessment tools (Recommendation Grade D).",

      "content": "!\nLung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, causing approximately 1.2 million deaths every year [1]. In Europe, 410000 new cases of lung cancer and 353000 related deaths have been estimated to have occurred in 2012.Most cases concern non-small-cell lung cancer (Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)) [1]. Accurate staging is mandatory for planning optimal treatment [2]. Surgery or radiotherapy with curative intent is advised in the case of localized disease. Spread to ipsilateral (N2) or contralateral (N3) mediastinal lymph nodes marginalizes the role of surgery as first-line treatment. For disseminated Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy is recommended [3].\nImaging by computed tomography (CT) and/or positron emission tomography (PET) should be obtained to characterize the primary lung lesion and the mediastinum, and to search for metastases. Although the detection of enlarged (at CT, short axis >10mm) or fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid mediastinal lymph nodes at PET increases the probability of malignant involvement [4,5], nevertheless the accuracy of radiological imaging in mediastinal staging is suboptimal [6 -8]. Therefore, additional mediastinal tissue staging is frequently required to confirm or exclude metastatic mediastinal nodal involvement. This applies not only in patients who present with an abnormal mediastinum [9 -11], but also in those with a normal mediastinum but increased risk of mediastinal involvement because of hilar abnormalities or a centrally located lung tumor [12].\nMediastinoscopy has been demonstrated to have an adequate accuracy for mediastinal nodal staging [13], but is also associated with morbidity and significant costs [13]. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) and endobronchial ultrasound with real-time guided transbronchial needle aspiration (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA) represent valuable alternatives to surgical staging (see Box 1 ; [14 -18]). Both techniques are minimally invasive, safe, well-tolerated, and rarely require general anesthesia [14,19,20]. Recently, endosonography has been recommended in guidelines as the initial test of choice over surgical staging [21,\n7 For diagnostic purposes, in patients with a centrally located lung tumor that is not visible at conventional bronchoscopy, endosonography is suggested, provided the tumor is located immediately adjacent to the larger airways (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)) or esophagus (EUS-(B)) (Recommendation grade D).\n8 In patients with a left adrenal gland suspected for distant metastasis we suggest performance of endoscopic ultrasound fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) (Recommendation grade C), while the use of EUS-B with a transgastric approach is at present experimental (Recommendation grade D).\n9 For optimal endosonographic staging of lung cancer, we suggest that individual endoscopists should be trained in both Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and EUS-B in order to perform complete endoscopic staging in one session (Recommendation grade D).\n10 Wesuggest that new trainees in endosonography should follow a structured training curriculum consisting of simulationbased training followed by supervised practice on patients (Recommendation grade D).\n11 We suggest that competency in Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA and EUS-(B)FNA for staging lung cancer be assessed using available validated assessment tools (Recommendation Grade D).\n22], because it improves nodal tissue staging, reduces the number of futile thoracotomies [18], and is cost-effective [23,24]. The integration of the two techniques in a single ' combined ' endoscopic approach to staging of the mediastinum has been shown to further increase the accuracy as compared with either technique alone [25].\nThe aim of this Guideline, from the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) in cooperation with the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and the European Society for Thoracic Surgery (ESTS), is to address the benefit and burden associated with mediastinal nodal staging of lung cancer by combined endobronchial ultrasound (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)) and endoscopic esophageal ultrasound (EUS-(B); that is with use of either the GI or the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) scope). Additionally the use of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)/EUS for the analysis of the primary lung tumor and the left adrenal gland will be addressed, as will training issues.",

      "content": "This Guideline has been commissioned by ESGE and produced in cooperation with ERS and ESTS.The guideline development process included meetings, telephone conferences, and internetbased discussions, between October 2012 and December 2014, among members of the Guideline committee who had been selected by the involved societies.\nSubgroups were formed, each in charge of a series of clearly defined key questions ( ● \" Appendix e1 , available online). These working group members identified appropriate search terms and parameters to direct the literature search. A thorough search of MEDLINE (accessed through PubMed), Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was performed. Specific search strategies, including search terms, parameters, and databases searched, are documented for each question in ● \" Appendix e2 (available online). English-language literature concerning the combination of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA and EUS-(B)-FNA in the diagnosis and in the staging of lung cancer was selected. Literature on the combination of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and EUS as well as on EUS or Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) alone was selected for review. Initially studies were selected from a period limited to 1990 to October 2013.However, because of delay in the preparation of the manuscript it was decided to additionally include a few important studies published after the search period. Working group members reviewed all abstracts yielded from the literature search and identified the full-text articles they would review in order to address the clinical questions. Members identified the best research evidence available to answer the key questions. The Guideline considers only the linear (not radial) probe technique.",

      "content": "No single mediastinal tissue sampling method can reach all mediastinal nodal stations.\nThe diagnostic yield of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-transbronchial needle aspiration (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA) is related to those mediastinal and hilar nodes that are located immediately adjacent to the trachea and larger airways. These comprise stations 2L, 2R, 4L, 4R, and station 7.Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), uniquely, can sample tissue from the hilar nodes (station 10) and from the intrapulmonary nodes (stations 11 -12).\nEUS with real-time guided fine needle aspiration using the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) scope (EUS-B-FNA) can reach the following locations that are relevant to lung cancer diagnosis and staging [14 -16]: lung tumors close to the esophagus; mediastinal lymph nodes in stations 2L, 4L (high and lower left paratracheal nodes); station 7 (subcarinal node); stations 8 and 9 (nodes located in the lower mediastinum); and structures below the diaphragm, i.e., retroperitoneal lymph nodes close to the aorta and the celiac trunk, and tumors in the left liver lobe and the left adrenal gland [17]. Stations 2R and 4R (paratracheally to the right) are difficult to reach because the trachea lies between the transducer and the lymph node, limiting visualization of this area. In selected cases of large lymph nodes (>2 cm), however, visualization and subsequent sampling is possible.\nStations 5 and 6 can be well visualized by EUS but can rarely be sampled without traversing the pulmonary artery/aorta. These stations are predominantly affected by left upper lobe tumors. Surgical staging by video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) is the method of choice for nodes in stations 5 and 6. The hilar regions (lung tumors and lymph nodes in stations 10, 11, and 12 [right/left]) cannot be reached by EUS-FNA, but they can be sampled using Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA. Combining these two techniques allows sampling of virtually all mediastinal nodal stations [18] (see ● \" Fig.1 ). The frequently affected nodes in locations 4L and 7 are accessible by both techniques.",

Evidence levels and recommendation grades used in this Guideline were slightly modified from those recommended by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) [26] and are described in ● \" Table1 . The SIGN approach classifies recommendations according to the quality of evidence, taking also into consideration whether the studies were directly applicable to the study population. Evidence tables are detailed in ● \" Appendix e3 (available online).\nCaution should be used in developing guidelines and recommendations for diagnostic tests and strategies. Usually, when clinicians consider diagnostic tests, they focus on accuracy (sensitivity and specificity); that is, how well the test classifies patients correctly as having or not having a target disease, as determined by a clinical reference standard. The underlying assumption is, however, that obtaining a better idea of whether a target condition is present or absent will result in improved patient-important outcomes. The best way to assess any diagnostic strategy is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which investigators randomize patients to experimental or control diagnostic approaches\nand measure mortality, morbidity, symptoms, and/or quality of life. When studies were available that compared the impact of alternative diagnostic strategies on patient-important outcomes they were taken into account. Otherwise test accuracy was used as a surrogate for patient-important outcome.\nAfter a final meeting in June 2014, all authors agreed on the final revised manuscript, which was submitted to the official Journals of the Societies. This Guideline was issued in 2015 and will be considered for review in 2019, or sooner if new and crucial evidence becomes available.

[18] compared immediate surgical mediastinal staging versus combined endosonography staging (endobronchial ultrasound [Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)] and endoscopic esophageal ultrasound [EUS] combined) followed by surgical staging if no mediastinal nodal metastases were detected. In detail, 241 patients with enlarged or FDG-avid mediastinal lymph nodes, enlarged or FDG-avid hilar lymph nodes, or a central lung lesion were randomized. The reference standard was surgical pathological staging including mediastinal nodal dissection. The sensitivity for mediastinal lymph node metastasis was 79% for surgical staging versus 94% for endosonography followed by surgical staging ( P =0.04), with corresponding negative predictive\nvalues (NPVs) of 86% and 93% ( P =0.26), respectively. The sensitivity of the combination of EUS and Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) alone -without subsequent surgical staging -was 85%; this was not significantly different from immediate surgical staging. Among patients with (suspected) Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a staging strategy combining endosonography and surgical staging versus immediate surgical staging reduced the percentage of unnecessary thoracotomies from 18% to 7% ( P =0.02) [18].\nIn the ASTER study [18], following a negative endosonography, 65 patients underwent mediastinoscopy which detected 6 additional cases of N2/N3 disease. In the subgroup of patients with an abnormal mediastinum shown by radiological imaging, after a negative endosonography the post-test probability for lymph node metastasis was 20% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 12% -32%), and adding a confirmatory mediastinoscopy in these patients with negative endosonography decreased the post-test probability for missed nodal metastases to 5% (95%CI 2% -20%) [27]. Therefore, additional surgical staging, especially in this specific subset of patients, is indicated. If negative endosonography results are not followed by confirmatory surgical staging, careful follow-up is mandatory.",

In a meta-analysis by Gu et al.

The reference standard was histopathology in 10 studies, and histopathology Odds ratio (or) clinical follow-up in 8. The sensitivity was 90% (95%CI 84% -94%) in the subgroup of patients with abnormal mediastinal lymph nodes at radiological imaging, and 58% (95%CI 39% -75%) among patients without abnormal mediastinal lymph nodes. There was risk of bias in many of the studies included in these meta-analyses. This may have led to overestimations of the sensitivity of the tests.",

In the prospective comparative study by Wallace et al. [31], TBNA, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, and EUS-FNA for mediastinal staging of lung cancer were performed in 138 patients against a reference standard of surgery or clinical follow-up.The overall sensitivity of the combination of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA and EUS-FNA was 93%. This was significantly higher than the sensitivities of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA (69%), EUS-\nFNA (69%), and conventional TBNA (36%) alone. Vilmann et al. [32] found that the accuracy of EUS-FNA and Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA in combination for the diagnosis of mediastinal cancer was 100% in 28 patients, against a reference standard of surgery or clinical follow-up.\nThe diagnostic value of the combined endosonography approach has recently been compared with that of CT-PET for mediastinal nodal staging of lung cancer [33]. Overall, 120 consecutive patients with suspected resectable lung cancer on CT findings (with and without enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes) underwent CT-PET and combined EUS-FNA plus Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA. A final pathological N stage was established in 110 patients. The accuracy of the combination of EUS-FNA plus Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was significantly higher than that of CT-PET (90.0% vs. 73.6%).\nHerth et al. [34] analyzed 139 patients who underwent combined Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and EUS-B endosonographic staging. The reference standard was surgical confirmation or clinical follow-up.Sensitivity was 89% for EUS-FNA and 92% for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA. The combined approach had a sensitivity of 96% and an NPV of 96%.\nIn a recent RCT [35], 160 patients were randomized to either Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA followed by EUS-B-FNA (group A) or to receive EUSB-FNA followed by Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA (group B). In both arms, the second procedure was performed on mediastinal nodes inaccessible or difficult to access by the first procedure. No significant differences in final accuracy emerged between groups A and B. However, while in group A, adding EUS-FNA to Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA did not significantly increase the accuracy or sensitivity, in group B, adding Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA to EUS-FNA did significantly increase the accuracy and sensitivity.\nHwangbo et al. [36] evaluated the role of EUS-B-FNA for mediastinal lymph nodes that were inaccessible or difficult to access by Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA in 143 patients, with a reference standard of surgical confirmation. The sensitivity, NPV, and diagnostic accuracy of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA alone for the detection of mediastinal metastasis were 84.4%, 93.3%, and 95.1%, respectively. The corresponding values for the combination of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA plus EUS-B-FNA increased to 91.1%, 96.1%, and 97.2%, respectively. The proportion of mediastinal nodal stations accessible by Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was 78.6%, and the proportion increased to 84.8% by combining EUS-B-FNA with Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA ( P =0.015). EUS-B-FNA identified mediastinal metastasis in 3 additional patients.\nIn a recent prospective Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) staging trial in 146 patients, by Oki et al., Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) was routinely followed by EUS-B. The prevalence of mediastinal nodal metastases was 23%. The sensitivities of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), EUS-B, and the combination were 52%, 45%, and 73%, respectively, with NPVs of 88%, 86%, and 93%, when using a surgical procedure (or clinical follow-up in a minority of patients) as the reference standard [37]. The subcentimeter size of the lymph nodes in combination with the low prevalence of malignancy might account for the low sensitivity of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS).Often small lymph nodes, especially in the left paratracheal station 4L, are more easily aspirated from the esophagus. In coughing patients, getting a good sample out of these small lymph nodes with Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) can be troublesome. In this study, patients were turned on their left side for EUS-B; it is questionable whether this is needed as EUSB is mostly performed with patients in supine position [38].\nLee et al. [39] retrospectively analyzed 37 cases in which EUS-B was performed in addition to Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) when nodes were inaccessible by Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) or when tissue sampling by Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) alone was unsatisfactory. A reference standard of mediastinoscopy or mediastinal lymph node dissection was used. The sensitivity of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) compared with the combination was 79% vs. 100% ( P =0.008), and in 6\nNPV, negative predictive value; 95%CI, 95% confidence interval; EUS-B, endoscopic (esophageal) ultrasound using the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) scope; TEMLA, transcervical extended bilateral mediastinal lymph adenectomy\npatients (13%) their disease was upstaged based on EUS-B findings.\nIn a study by Liberman et al. [40], 166 patients with (suspected) Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) underwent Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), EUS, and mediastinoscopy in the same setting. The prevalence of mediastinal metastases was 32%. Against a reference standard of mediastinoscopy, the sensitivity and NPVs were: for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), 72% and 88%; for EUS, 62% and 85%; and for combined Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)/EUS, 91% and 96%. Endosonography was diagnostic for N2/N3/M1 disease in 24 patients in whom mediastinoscopy findings were negative, preventing futile thoracotomy in 14% of patients [40].\nThe combination of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA and EUS-FNA showed a pooled sensitivity of 86% (95%CI 82% -90%) with a 100% specificity for mediastinal nodal staging in a meta-analysis based on 8 studies (821 patients) [25]. The sensitivity of the combined Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and EUS investigations appeared to be higher in the subgroup with mediastinal abnormalities, but pooled data were not provided. Although the authors concluded that ' the current evidence suggests that the combined technique is more sensitive than EBUSTBNA or EUS-FNA alone, ' they did not statistically compare results from individual tests with the combined approach.\nRandom-effects meta-analysis was performed to evaluate the increase in sensitivity provided by the combined approach. Adding EUS-(B)-FNA to Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for mediastinal nodal staging in a series of patients with established Odds ratio (or) suspected lung cancer, showed an increase in sensitivity of 13% (95%CI 8% -20%) for the combined approach compared with Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA alone (9 studies; ● \" Fig.2a ). Adding Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA to EUS-(B)-FNA showed an increase in sensitivity of 21% (95%CI 13% -30%) for the combined approach compared with EUS-(B)-FNA alone (7 studies; ● \" Fig.2b ). Assuming a prevalence of nodal metastasis of 50%, these numbers would indicate that in 100 patients, adding EUS(B)-FNA would avoid further surgical staging in an additional 6.5 cases not identified by initial Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA; conversely, adding Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA would avoid further surgical staging in an additional 10.5 cases not identified by initial EUS-(B)-FNA. Considering that the studies included in these meta-analyses are highly variable regarding quality and study population [25], that some studies included only patients with mediastinal lymph nodes that were not accessible by Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, that a ' complete ' Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA or EUS-FNA was not always performed, that the reference standard included imperfect tests in some cases, and in the absence of randomized trials comparing complete staging in single tests with the combined approach, the results of this pooled analysis should be interpreted with caution.",

The cost -effectiveness gain at 6 months was mainly related to a statistically significant reduction of the post-staging utility with the surgical compared with the combined endoscopic approach, and with a reduction in the overall costs associated with the nonsurgical staging procedure. The higher costs in the ' surgical ' arm were due to the higher number of thoracotomies that had to be performed in this arm, and not due to mediastinoscopy itself.\nIn a simulated model of evaluation of lung cancer patients with different prevalences of mediastinal disease, a cost-minimization analysis showed that the combination of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-FNA/EUS-FNA would appear as the most cost-effective approach, compared with bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy, when the expected prevalence of lymph node metastasis is higher than 32.9%. This occurs in patients with a finding of abnormal mediastinum at radiological staging [45]. In that model, EUS-FNA alone appeared to be the most cost-effective approach if the prevalence of lymph node metastasis is lower than mentioned above as well as in patients without abnormal lymph nodes on CT [45].\n2. For mediastinal nodal staging in patients with suspected or proven nonsmall-cell peripheral lung cancer without mediastinal involvement at CTor CTPET , we suggest that Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA and/or EUS-(B)-FNA should be performed before therapy, provided that one or more of the following conditions is present: (i) enlarged or fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET-avid ipsilateral hilar nodes; (ii) primary tumor without FDG uptake; (iii) tumor size ≥ 3 cm; ( ● \" Fig.3a -c ) (Recommendation grade C).\nIf endosonography does not show malignant nodal involvement, we suggest that mediastinoscopy is considered, especially in suspected N1 disease (Recommendation grade C).\nIf PET is not available and CT does not reveal enlarged hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes, we suggest performance of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA and/or EUS-FNA and/or surgical staging (Recommendation grade C).\n3.

In two abovementioned meta-analyses [29, 30], the sensitivity for mediastinal nodal staging in the subgroup of patients regardless of, Odds ratio (or) without suspicious lymph nodes at CT Odds ratio (or) PET was 76% (95% CI 65% -85%) for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA (3 studies, 263 patients) and 58% (95%CI 39% -75%) for EUS-FNA (4 studies, 175 patients). Assuming a prevalence of 20%, these numbers would indicate that 100 patients need to undergo endosonography to detect, respectively, 15.2 and 11.6 cases of mediastinal involvement in whom further surgical staging can be prevented. However, given the wide confidence intervals, especially for EUS, and the varying prevalence, these numbers should be interpreted with caution.\nDooms et al. [47,48] prospectively evaluated 100 consecutive patients with suspected resectable clinical N1 (cN1) disease, and a normal mediastinum, based on CT-PET with Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS).The primary outcome was the sensitivity of endosonography to detect N2 disease, against a reference standard of histopathology. A total of 24 patients were diagnosed with N2 disease. The sensitivity from endosonography alone was 38% and this was increased to 73% by adding mediastinoscopy. So, in this population, 10 underwent mediastinoscopy to detect a single case with N2 disease missed by endosonography. In this study, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) was performed in all patients, while EUS was only added in patients with inaccessible or difficult-to-reach lymph nodes. However, in 8 of the 14 falsenegative cases where no EUS was performed, the affected nodes were well within the reach of EUS-(B), being stations 4L, 7, and 8.Should EUS-(B) have been routinely performed, the sensitivity of endosonography could have been above 70% [38,47].\nAccording to a post hoc subgroup analysis of the ASTER trial [27], the prevalence of mediastinal metastases in patients without a suspicious mediastinum at CT-PET imaging was 26% and the sensitivity of combined Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and EUS staging was 71%, although confidence intervals were wide (36% -92%) because of the small number of patients in this subgroup.In this subgroup of patients, the post-test probability for lymph node metastasis after a negative endosonography was 9% (95%CI 4% -24%). After the addition of mediastinoscopy, the post-test probability remained unaffected [27]. In the surgical staging arm of the study, in patients with a non-suspicious mediastinum, the prevalence of mediastinal metastases was 17% and the sensitivity of surgical staging was 60% (23% -88%), with a post-test probability of 8% (95%CI 3% -19%) after a negative test.\nWallace et al. [31] described a subgroup of 60 patients with negative mediastinal findings at CT and PET who underwent both Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and EUS.The sensitivity and NPV were 17% (95%CI 2% -48%) and 83% for TBNA, 50% (95%CI 21% -79%) and 89% for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, 67% (95%CI 35% -90%) and 92% for EUS-FNA, and 75% (95%CI 43% -95%) and 94% for combined Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) -EUS. We found only one prospective study [41] that aimed to assess the diagnostic yield of the combined endosonographic approach in patients with Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and a normal mediastinum on CT alone (stage lA -llB). A total of 120 patients underwent the combined approach with both Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA and EUS-FNA followed by transcervical extended bilateral mediastinal lymphadenectomy (TEMLA) and, if negative, pulmonary resection with dissection of the mediastinum as a confirmatory test. The overall sensitivity of the combined approach was 68%, the NPV was 91%, and the positive predictive value (PPV) was 91%, at a prevalence of N2/N3\nFig.2 Endobronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle aspiration (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA) combined with endoscopic (esophageal) ultrasound with real-time guided fine needle aspiration either using the conventional EUS endoscope or using the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) scope (that is, EUS-(B)-FNA) for mediastinal nodal staging: comparison of the sensitivity of a single test with that of the combined approach. a Increase in sensitivity of the combined approach compared with Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA alone. b Increase in sensitivity of the combined approach compared with EUS-(B)-FNA alone.

The ' Events ' columns show the numbers of cases that were detected by the combined approach, but not by a single test. The ' Total ' columns show the total number of cases, as determined by the reference standard.

In this study, 120 patients needed to undergo endosonography to detect 19 cases (16%) in which further surgical staging could be prevented. Additional surgical staging in the remaining 101 patients identified another 9 cases. The overall sensitivity of the combined technique was significantly higher than the sensitivity with Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) alone (46%, 95%CI 28% -65%) and also higher and close to the level of significance when compared with the sensitivity of EUS alone (50%, 95%CI 31% -69%).\n4. For mediastinal staging in patients with centrally located suspected or proven Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without mediastinal or hilar involvement at CT and/or CT-PET, we suggest performance of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, with or without EUS-(B)-FNA, in preference to surgical staging ( ● \" Fig.4 ) (Recommendation grade D).

There are few studies in the literature about the role of endosonography for mediastinal staging of patients with a centrally located tumor [50,51]. Moreover, it must be noted that there is no agreement in the studies concerning the definition of centrally located lung tumors. In a retrospective cohort of 16 patients who had EUS-FNA of lung mass lesions adjacent to or abutting the esophagus, 10 patients had invasion of the mediastinum by the tumor as shown by EUS, defined as loss of interface between the tumor and the mediastinum, with an irregular border. Out of those 10 patients, 6 had mediastinal lymph nodes. EUS-FNA of the lymph nodes in 3 of those 6 patients did not yield a preliminary diagnosis after 3 needle passes. It was technically difficult to assess the mediastinal lymph nodes in the other 3 patients, because the lung mass was in close proximity and precluded lymph node access [50]. In another study, out of 17 patients undergoing EUS-FNA of a centrally located primary lung neoplasm, EUS identified metastatic lymph node involvement in 3 [51]. The accuracy of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-only for mediastinal staging has already been addressed above [29].\n5.

Overall sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and diagnostic accuracy of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for mediastinal restaging after induction chemotherapy were 76%, 100%, 100%, 20%, and 77%, respectively [60].\nSzlubowski et al. retrospectively analyzed a group of 61 consecutive Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with pathologically confirmed N2 disease who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and in whom Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNAwasperformed for restaging. The sensitivity and negative NPVof the restaging Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA were 67% and 78%, respectively [61]. Recently, Szlubowski et al. prospectively assessed the diagnostic utility of combined Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA and EUS-B-FNA for Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) restaging after induction therapy in 106 patients with pathologically proven N2 disease. The prevalence of persistent mediastinal lymph node metastases was 51.9% and the sensitivity, specificity, total accuracy, PPV, and NPV values of the combined approach were 67.3%, 96.0%, 81.0%, 95.0%, and 73.0%, respectively. The overall accuracy of the combined approach was higher as compared with Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA and EUS-FNA alone [62].\n6. A complete assessment of mediastinal and hilar nodal stations, and sampling of at least three different mediastinal nodal stations (4R, 4L, 7) ( ● \" Fig.1 , ● \" Fig.5 ) is suggested in patients with Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and an abnormal mediastinum by CT or CT-PET (Recommendation grade D).",

      "content": "For surgical nodal staging by mediastinoscopy, clear recommendations have been made regarding the number and nodes to be sampled [21,22]. For endosonography, there is no agreement about how many and which lymph node stations should be sampled and which level of thoroughness is necessary for different situations. Some advise a thorough evaluation of all lymph nodes detectable by Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and EUS followed by sampling. In many centers, however, the so-called ' hit and run ' approach is followed, where only the lymph nodes that are suspicious at CT-PET imaging are sampled.\nIn the recent Guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) [22], a classification of levels of thoroughness has been developed and could serve as a guide. Four approaches were proposed: A, complete sampling of each node in each major mediastinal node station (2R, 4R, 2L, 4L, 7, and possibly 5 or 6); B, systematic sampling of each node station; C, selective sampling of suspicious nodes only; D, very limited or no sampling, with only visual assessment.\nIn line with the ESTS guidelines [21], we recommend that at least three stations should be assessed (subcarinal, left paratracheal, and right paratracheal) and biopsy samples should be taken if possible with Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), EUS, or mediastinoscopy. Furthermore, all other abnormal lymph nodes, identified by size or FDG avidity, should be sampled. This ' complete ' mediastinal staging is based on the concept that identification of one malignant lymph node does not mean that mediastinal staging was optimal.\n7. For diagnostic purposes, in patients with a centrally located lung tumor that is not visible at conventional bronchoscopy, endosonography is suggested, provided the tumor is located immediately adjacent to the larger airways (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)) or esophagus (EUS-(B)) (Recommendation grade D).\nTo date, there are limited studies regarding the role of EUS-FNA and Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA in the diagnosis of lung parenchymal masses. A recent retrospective study [63] assessed the diagnostic yield and safety of EUS-FNA of central mediastinal lung masses. In 11 out of 73 patients, the lung mass could not be visualized by EUS.The sensitivity of EUS was 96.7% when only the visualized masses were considered, but this value dropped to 80.8% when the 11 nonvisualized masses were also taken into account. Annema et al. [64] conducted a prospective study with 32 patients to assess the feasibility and diagnostic yield of EUS-FNA for the diagnosis of centrally located lung tumors following a nondiagnostic bronchoscopy. EUS-FNA provided a diagnosis of malignancy in 97% of patients. In 39% of the patients, EUS-FNA not only established the diagnosis of lung cancer, but also staged patients as having T4 disease, based on tumor invasion; however, the latter was not verified surgically. None of the included patients had mediastinal lymph node involvement at CTscan [64]. Varadarajulu et al. [50] conducted a retrospective study including 18 patients who had undergone EUS-FNA of a lung mass abutting the esophageal wall. A diagnosis was obtained in all patients. Hernandez et al. [51] retrospectively described their experience with EUS-FNA of centrally located primary lung cancers; 17 patients had FNA of both the lung mass and the mediastinal lymph\nnodes, and all procedures provided an accurate diagnosis of the primary lung lesion.\nIn a retrospective noncomparative study including 60 patients with a central parenchymal lung lesion suspected to be lung cancer (82% with a prior nondiagnostic flexible bronchoscopy), Tournoy et al. [65] demonstrated that the sensitivity of EBUSTBNA was 82% with a NPV of 23%. An exploratory analysis showed that the sensitivity for small versus large lesions, when a short-axis cutoff was arbitrarily set at 25mm, was 78% (95%CI 57% -91%) vs. 86% (95%CI 68% -96%), respectively ( P =0.50). Verma et al. [15] also recently demonstrated in 37 patients that Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA is an effective way (overall sensitivity 91.4%) to diagnose parenchymal lesions located centrally close to the airways.\n8. In patients with a left adrenal gland suspected for distant metastasis we suggest performance of EUS-FNA (Recommendation grade C), while the use of EUS-B with a transgastric approach is at present experimental (Recommendation grade D).",

      "content": "The adrenal glands are a predilection site for lung cancer metastases. Distant metastases have significant impact on prognosis and treatment. Adrenal metastases originating from Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have been found in approximately 10% -59% of patients in autopsy series [66].\nFDG-PET-CT has a high accuracy (sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 85%) for adrenal metastases in patients with lung cancer [67]. However, adrenal glands that are suspicious at FDG-PET-CT can be false-positive [68] and therefore tissue verification is indicated to either confirm or rule out metastatic spread in order to prevent PET/CT-based upstaging in patients.\nTraditionally, adrenal masses have been sampled by percutaneous biopsy. A small study involving only 15 patients reported sensitivity and NPV for adrenal biopsy of 73% and 60%, respectively [69]. A study involving 79 patients reported an overall complication rate for percutaneous adrenal biopsies of 8.4% [70], including hemorrhage, pneumothorax, pancreatitis, adrenal abscesses, bacteremia, and needle-tract metastases. Transgastric EUS-guided FNA can be performed during the same session as a mediastinal staging procedure, using the same endoscope.",

      "content": "In 1996, Chang reported the first application of EUS and EUS-FNA for left adrenal gland analysis and found that the left adrenal gland was visualized in 30 out of 31 patients (97%) [71].\nIn 31 patients with suspected thoracic or gastrointestinal malignancies and enlarged left adrenal gland on abdominal imaging (including 15 patients with lung cancer), Eloubeidi et al. reported that EUS-FNA obtained adequate tissue from the left adrenal gland in all patients [72].\nIn a mixed series of 119 patients with gastrointestinal or pulmonary disease, who underwent EUS with or without FNA, the left adrenal gland was routinely examined. The overall prevalence of a left adrenal mass was 4/119 (3.4%), all detected in the cohort of patients (n=12) with lung cancer [73]. In a retrospective analysis of 40 patients, with established or suspected lung cancer and an enlarged left adrenal gland shown at EUS, the diagnostic yield of EUS-FNA for detecting left adrenal metastases was 95% [74].\nIn a retrospective analysis by Schuurbiers et al. of 85 patients with (suspected) lung cancer and a left adrenal gland suspicious for metastasis identified by CT and/or FDG-PET, EUS-FNA demonstrated left adrenal metastases in 62% and benign adrenal tissue in 29%. Sensitivity and NPV for EUS-FNA of the left adrenal gland were at least 86% (95%CI 74 -93%) and 70% (95%CI 50 -85%), respectively. No complications occurred [75].\nEloubeidi et al. evaluated 59 patients with enlarged adrenal gland(s) on abdominal CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and/or PET, and known or suspected malignancy. All patients underwent EUS-guided FNA (54 left adrenal gland and 5 right adrenal gland), and adrenal tissue adequate for interpretation was obtained in all patients. On multivariable analysis, altered adrenal gland shape (loss of seagull configuration) was a significant predictor of malignancy [76].\nMost literature about EUS of the adrenal gland concerns the left adrenal gland. However there are some reports about transduodenal EUS-guided FNA of the right adrenal gland. It seems feasible and safe in experienced hands [77 -79].\nRecently, Uemura and colleagues retrospectively analyzed a consecutive series of 150 patients with potentially resectable lung cancer who were undergoing EUS/EUS-FNA for mediastinal staging of lung cancer. Routinely, both the left and right adrenal glands were assessed. The left adrenal gland was visualized in all patients (100%) and the right adrenal gland in 87.3% of patients [79]. Transgastric analysis and FNA of the left adrenal gland using an Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) scope has been described [77], but its feasibility and safety are under investigation.\nComplications of EUS-guided FNA of adrenal glands are rare; an adrenal hemorrhage has been described [80]. However, it should be emphasized, that in the case of signs of a pheochromocytoma, endocrinologic evaluation must be done prior to endosonography.\n9. For optimal endosonographic staging of lung cancer, we suggest that individual endoscopists should be trained in both Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and EUS-B, in order to perform complete endoscopic staging in one session (Recommendation grade D).",

Diagnostic yield improves with practice [81], and the number of complications is also associated with operator experience [82]. Despite this, there is a paucity of evidence-based structured training programs, and\nthe important decision about when a trainee is considered competent is often based on an arbitrary number of performed procedures or on subjective impressions.\nAs the combined staging by Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and EUS is superior to staging by a single technique [25], it seems logical that the skills should be present in a single operator [83]. For practical and economic reasons, the majority of procedures will be performed with Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) scopes for both the endobronchial and esophageal route.\n10. We suggest that new trainees in endosonography should follow a structured training curriculum consisting of simulation-based training followed by supervised practice on patients (Recommendation grade D).",

      "content": "A systematic review and meta-analysis regarding technologyenhanced simulation, based on 609 papers, found ' large effects for outcomes of knowledge, skills, and behaviors and moderate effects for patient-related outcomes ' [84]. There are two virtual reality simulators commercially available for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS): the GI Bronch Mentor (Simbionix, Cleveland, Ohio, USA) and the AccuTouch Flexible Bronchoscopy Simulator (CAE Healthcare, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). Both simulators can discriminate between novices and experienced operators (indicating construct validity) [85, 86], but there are no published studies exploring the effect of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) simulator training on patient care. No software exists for mediastinal sampling using EUS, but EUS-FNA as well as Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA can be practiced on rubber models, animal organs, or live anesthetized animals. A study regarding Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA training found both computer simulation and wet lab simulation to be effective and complementary [87].\nHowever, despite the positive effects of simulation-based training, it is important to remember that no existing simulators are 100% realistic and not all aspects of a procedure can be practiced. Supervised performance during initial patient encounters is essential, even after a thorough simulation-based training program -self-learning of endosonography should be discouraged [88].\n11. We suggest that competency in Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA and EUS-(B)-FNA for staging lung cancer be assessed using available validated assessment tools (Recommendation grade D).",

      "content": "Early guidelines for gastrointestinal EUS recommend a minimum of 150 total supervised procedures [90], but a more recent study on learning curves showed ' substantial variability in achieving competency and a consistent need for more supervision than current recommendations ' [91]. It is generally agreed that sampling in the mediastinum is technically easier than in other locations [92] and a study showed that chest physicians achieved satisfactory results after participating in an EUS implementation program for staging lung cancer patients [93]. The only study exploring learning curves for EUS-FNA for lung cancer staging found that acquisition of skills varied between individuals and that 20 procedures were not enough to ensure basic competency [94].\nEarly guidelines on training requirements for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) from the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society and the ACCP respectively recommend minimum numbers of 40 and 50 procedures for initial acquisition of competence [95,96]. These numbers are based on expert opinions, are arbitrary, and are debated [89,97]. Studies on Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) learning curves have shown that performance of 50 procedures does not ensure basic competency [60,95], and the latest Guidelines from the British Thoracic Society recognise that ' Individuals have different learning curves and hence focus should be towards monitoring an individual ' s performance and outcomes ' [98]. Specific tools for assessment of performance in endosonography [99, 100] could be used for monitoring trainees ' progression, and all programs should continuously monitor their outcomes.\nThese guidelines from ESGE, ERS, and ESTS represent a consensus of best practice based on the available evidence at the time of preparation. They may not apply in all situations and should be interpreted in the light of specific clinical situations and resource availability. Further controlled clinical studies may be needed to clarify aspects of the statements, and revision may be necessary as new data appear. Clinical consideration may justify a course of action at variance to these recommendations. ESGE guidelines are intended to be an educational device to provide information that may assist endoscopists in providing care to patients. They are not rules and should not be construed as establishing a legal standard of care or as encouraging, advocating, requiring, or discouraging any particular treatment.\nCompeting interests: Support for educational endosonography courses has been provided to the Academic Medical Center (AMC), Amsterdam, by Hitachi Medical Systems, Pentax, COOK Medical and Symbionix.
