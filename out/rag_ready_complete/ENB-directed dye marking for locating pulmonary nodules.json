      "title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "content": "With the popularisation of low-dose CT scan, the detection rate of solitary pulmonary nodules has improved to 8% -51%, where the probability of malignant tumours is 3.8% -13%. 1 The overall 5-year survival rate of patients with lung cancer is as low as 15%, but can be as high as 80%, 2 postsurgery in the initial stages. Therefore, early detection and treatment of lung cancer are crucial to survival. Video-associated thoracic surgery (VATS) significantly aids in the diagnosis and treatment of small peripheral pulmonary nodules (PPNs). However, ground-glass opacities (GGOs), or\nsubcentimetre nodules, which are usually deepseated with no specific visual markers on the pleural surface, are often difficult to locate during surgery. Failure to locate PPNs during VATS may result in incomplete resection or switching to an open thoracotomy.\nCT-guided percutaneous techniques are presently deployed to pinpoint pulmonary nodules, and include hookwire, microcoil, radiotracer, methylene blue or indocyanine green injections, and fiducial localisation. 3 -8 However, such techniques often carry a high risk of haemothorax and pneumothorax, 9 and generally necessitate close cooperation between interventional radiologists and thoracic surgeons. Localisation procedures are often performed in the interventional radiology department, and patients need to be shifted to the operating room (OR) for surgery. Any unforeseen delays may cause displacement or even abscission of the solid localiser. Moreover, pleural dyes, such as indocyanine green and methylene blue, have a tendency to diffuse far beyond the site of injection, and such occurrences can induce localisation failure.\nElectromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy (ENB) has emerged as a transbronchial location tool that can assist minimally invasive resection of PPNs. The procedure can be performed in the OR, thus circumventing potential localisation failures, which are typical with CT-guided percutaneous procedures.\nWe aimed to identify the value of ENB dye marking in small PPN localisations and present our initial experiences with this method.",

      "content": "This prospective, single-centre study was conducted at the Guangdong Provincial People ' s Hospital from May 2018 to April 2019. The inclusion criteria were patients with small PPNs that were expected to be difficult to locate intraoperatively and the presence of multiple pulmonary nodules. All patients required lung resection (wedge resection, segmentectomy or lobectomy). The exclusion criteria were (1) allergies to dyes (methylene blue or indocyanine green), previous bronchial asthma or allergic constitution; (2) excessive obesity; or (3) chest CT that revealed large PPNs close to the pleura. The primary outcome was the pleural staining success rate and accuracy in locating PPNs. The secondary outcomes included procedure time and complications. The ENB procedure was considered successful if pleural staining was visible and the localisation accuracy was achieved. Each patient underwent a 1-month follow-up examination.",

      "title": "ENB dye marking and surgical procedure",
      "content": "A respiratory physician in the OR performed the ENB-guided pleural dye marking procedure, prior to VATS. The electromagnetic navigation system (Lungcare, Guangzhou, China) helped reconstruct the chest CT into a three-dimensional airway tree, generating an optimum pathway to the lesion. The patient lay on the examination bed after removing any metal objects from their body. The body position sensors were then attached to the patient ' s chest (three altogether; one attached to the manubrium sterni, and the other two attached to the eighth rib and the anterior axillary line intersection). General anaesthesia was subsequently administered to the patient through a single-lumen endotracheal tube, to perform the ENB-guided transbronchial dye marking procedure. First, the locatable guide wire was inserted into a flexible catheter, leaving the tip slightly exposed, and then fixed as an ensemble to prevent the guide wire from moving inside the catheter during the operation. Second, the ensemble was inserted into the working channel of the bronchoscope and advanced along the optimum pathway, as far as the bronchoscope could extend. The ensemble was then pushed further until it was set into the appropriate position (figure 1B). The guide wire was then withdrawn, leaving the catheter (extended working channel) in place. The flexible catheter was injected with 0.2 -1.0 mL of dye (indocyanine green (10 mL: 25 mg) or methylene blue (2 mL: 20 mg)), and then rinsed with 20 -60 mL of air to clear the remaining dye from the catheter. It is important that when resistance was sensed, the catheter was only slightly retracted, by 1 -2 mm, before attempting to inject air, so as to prevent introducing an air embolism.\nIn general, if the nodule was less than 20 mm from the pleural surface, the dye was injected directly into the nodule. However, if the nodule was located more than 20 mm from the pleural surface, the dye injection was applied midway between the nodule and the nearest pleural surface (figure 1A). The doses of dye and\nair were also determined as per the distance between the position of the dye injected and the nearest pleural surface. We did not use endobronchial ultrasound or fluoroscopy at any time during the process to confirm the location of the nodules. After completing the dye marking process to locate the nodule, the single-lumen endotracheal tube was replaced with a double-lumen tube. With the patient in an appropriate lateral decubitus position, a minimally invasive resection of the PPN was initiated. During surgery, the pulmonary surface was inspected, and the pleural dye was visualised (figure 1D). Resection of the nodule was guided via the relative spatial relationship of the theoretical location of the pleural dye and the actual location of the nodule (figure 1C). The surgical specimen (figure 1E) was then dissected to locate the small pulmonary nodule, and the distance of the nodule from the centre point of the pleural staining was measured (figure 1F). Frozen-section analyses of the nodule and resection margin were then performed.",

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "content": "In this prospective study, pleural staining was visible in most nodules. For the stained pleural nodules, we conducted paired sample t-tests on the theoretical and actual distances between the nodules and the pleural staining. We found that ENB-guided localisation was reliable and accurate for effectively guiding surgeons performing wedge resection of small PPNs. The average duration of the ENB localisation procedure was 12.6 min, which did not significantly prolong the operation time. No complications directly related to ENB-guided localisation procedures were observed. All nodules were completely resected, and resection margins were negative in all malignant nodules.\nThere are several potential advantages to applying ENB for the preoperative localisation of PPNs prior to minimally invasive resection. First, it can be safely and effectively implemented in the same OR, and VATS resection can be performed immediately following the localisation procedure. Therefore, multidisciplinary coordination (interventional radiology, surgeons, anaesthetists and other OR staff) may be avoided. Second, in this study, the average time from the completion of dye injection to the discovery of pleural staining was 44.0 min. Additionally, we did not observe any cases of localisation failure due to excessive dye diffusion. Bolton et al 10 revealed that the downtime for CT patients in their study was 189 min, and the longest delay was the wait between the completion of CT-guided nodule\nlocalisation and onset of surgery. The optimal mode is that surgical resection can be performed immediately following the localisation procedure. Nevertheless, CT-guided localisation is usually performed the day prior to surgery in our hospital. In addition, in our hospital, the thoracic surgeons tend to use CT-guided hookwire localisation for lung nodules. Such an extended time gap means that chest pain may occur during breathing since the distal end of hookwire was exposed out of skin, and also increases the possibility of pneumothorax or hookwire dislodgement. Conversely, pulmonary surgeons usually use the CT-guided injection of methylene blue for localisation. Similarly, the long delay resulted in that it was often difficult to locate the nodule using pleural staining during VATS resection because excessive diffusion and fading of methylene blue had occurred, particularly for substantially pigmented and anthracotic lung surfaces. 11 Third, there was no cause for concern over the risk of pneumothorax or haemorrhage associated with ENB-guided dye localisation because the surgery was performed immediately following localisation. However, with CT-guided localisation, patients had to wait for extended periods of time until the onset of surgery. If complications such as pneumothorax or haemorrhage occurred, it may seriously harm patients. A meta-analysis showed that the mean haemorrhage rates related to CT-guided hookwire and microcoil localisation were 16% and 6%, respectively. In contrast, the mean pneumothorax rates were as high as 35% and 16%forCT-guided hookwire and microcoil localisations, respectively, because the pleura was punctured. 12 Moreover, cases of air embolism were observed in CT-guided hookwire localisation studies, 13 14 and complications are more likely to occur in patients with multiple pulmonary nodules. 11\nWe were sure the pathological assessment of resected specimens would be unaffected by the dye, as established in a previous study using methylene blue. 15 Additionally, we did not perform injections in situ during the majority of the procedures. Moreover, in this study, the stained nodules were also diagnosed via pathological evaluation.\nPublished studies revealed that the ENB localisation success rate was 79% -100%. 16 -21 Awais and colleagues 20 performed ENB-guided localisation in 29 patients with a median lesion size of 10 mm. The median distance from the surface of the lung to the lesion was 13 mm, with a range of 3 -44 mm. The mean navigation time was less than 10 min, and all nodules were successfully located and resected. Marino and colleagues 19 reported 72 nodules located through the ENB-guided localisation procedure. In their study, the median nodule size was 8 mm, with a median distance of 6 mm from the pleural surface. The\nB\nTheoretical distance-Actual distance\nlocalisation success rate was 97.2%. Neither study observed adverse events related to the ENB-guided localisation procedure.\nGrogan and colleagues 22 reported lung nodule localisation by CT-guided percutaneous placement of technetium 99m in 84 patients. Among these patients, 77 nodules were successfully located and excised. In their study, the mean nodule size was 9.8 mm, with a mean distance of 11.7 mm from the pleural surface. However, complications occurred in 16% of patients, including pneumothoraces (eight patients), atrial arrhythmias (three patients) and prolonged air leak (one patient). The results indicated that ENB-guided and CT-guided localisations had the same high success rate, but that ENB-guided localisation may be associated with fewer complications. However, almost no study clearly defined the localisation accuracy of the ENB-guided localisation procedure. Thus, our study is the first to evaluate the accuracy of localisation via specific numerical values. The result of paired sample t-tests showed that there was no significant difference between the theoretical and actual distance from the centre of the nodule to the central point of pleural staining. We plotted such differences, showing a relative error between 0 mm and 13.0 mm, thus establishing the ENB localisation method as accurate and reliable, with an 82.1% success rate. In this study, only 32.1% of nodules had bronchus signs, with pleural staining visible in most. Additionally, the guide wire could directly reach the visceral pleura in five nodules. Thus, we can conclude that ENB localisation technology had no strict requirements for air bronchus sign.\nIt is very important to ensure pleural staining is visible, and this subject is worth exploring. In our study, staining was not observed in five nodules. Among these nodules, only 0.2 mL of dye was injected in three nodules; reflux occurred after the injection of 0.5 mL of methylene blue in one nodule; and in the remaining nodule, the site of dye injection was 41.0 mm from the pleura, with only 0.5 mL of methylene blue injected. Based on our experience, we believe that the following factors may lead to a higher success rate of pleural staining:\nâº Dose of the injected dye. When the locatable guide wire can reach the pleura directly, at least 0.3 mL of dye should be injected and the dosage should be correspondingly increased with increasing distances between the dye injection site and the visceral pleura. The maximum dose of dye in our study was 1.0 mL, with a distance of 31.0 mm between the injection site and the visceral pleura.\nâº Avoid dye reflux. We consider that dye reflux was related to huge resistance when we injected air, or when air was injected at a high speed. To avoid dye reflux, it is recommended that the flexible catheter be slightly adjusted until the resistance disappears, prior to injection. One can also attempt to push the dye to the distal end using the guide wire to avoid this problem; however, the efficacy of this approach needs to be further verified.\nâº Type of injected dye. This study used indocyanine green and methylene blue dyes. Since indocyanine green is a nearinfrared fluorescent dye, it is necessary to use a near-infrared fluorescence thoracoscope to observe whether the pleura is stained. 23 24 For unknown reasons, the fluorescence thoracoscope was not available during surgery of one nodule where indocyanine green dye was used, and eventually pleural staining was not visible. Therefore, it is suggested that methylene blue dye be selected when a fluorescence thoracoscope is not available.\nComplications occurred in two patients in this study. One of whom, with dyspnoea, had an increased heart rate and a decrease in haemoglobin, and was admitted to the intensive care unit for\nfurther treatment. We considered that this situation was related to the extended operation time and incomplete haemostasis during surgery. The other patient developed a slow heart rate, which was lowest during thoracic irrigation, at 30 beats per minute. Following atropine administration, the heart rate returned to normal. We deemed that this complication was not related to the ENB-guided localisation procedure, but rather surgical or anaesthetic stress. There were no other complications, such as allergies to the dyes. Remarkably, each patient underwent two intubations. Zias and colleagues 25 found that repeated intubation could cause mechanical damage to the mucosal tissue in the upper and middle segments of trachea, causing cell proliferation and granulation tissue formation, and thus leading to tracheal stenosis. Additionally, even if the endotracheal intubation time was very short or the intubation operation was smooth, nearly 97% of patients may develop laryngeal injury to varying degrees. 26 Therefore, this presents an urgent problem that must be resolved when performing ENB-guided localisation directly through the double-lumen endotracheal tube, instead of a single-lumen endotracheal tube.\nThe principal limitation of this study was the small sample size from a single centre. Therefore, studies with large sample sizes are required to identify the optimum dye dosage and injection sites, as well as the theoretical region of pleural staining.",
