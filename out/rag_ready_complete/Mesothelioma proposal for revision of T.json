      "content": "Clinical stage classi /uniFB01 cation of patients with pleural mesothelioma (PM) in the eighth edition is based on a qualitative assessment of imaging using binary criteria identifying invasion of adjacent structures. 1 As such, it is prone to interobserver and intraobserver variability resulting in inconsistent clinical staging and unclear prognostic accuracy. 2 -4 The use of the TNM stage classi/uniFB01 cation in clinical trials for PM is low. Large randomized trials in PM revealing the bene /uniFB01 t of platinum and antifolate chemotherapy, and more recently, the bene /uniFB01 t of dual-agent immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, did not include clinical stage as a strati /uniFB01 cation factor, unlike other solid thoracic malignancies. 5 -7 The circumferential rindlike appearance of pleural tumor, with its ability to invade multiple structures and planes simultaneously, limited distinction from adjacent tissue planes on imaging studies, and the inability to quantify the overall tumor burden with a single measurement has made it dif /uniFB01 cult to develop a size-based descriptor for the primary tumor (T) categories of the staging system. 8,9\nThe initial pathologic stage classi /uniFB01 cation system for PM was developed from a single-institution surgical database 10 in 1976 and later modi /uniFB01 ed using information from patients treated with extrapleural pneumonectomy (EPP) and trimodality therapy. 11 -13 Nevertheless, these systems did not conform to a TNM classi /uniFB01 cation system. In 1994, at a consensus workshop sponsored by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) and the International Mesothelioma Interest Group (IMIG), international PM experts proposed a stage classi /uniFB01 cation system based on the TNM format. This was subsequently accepted by the International Union Against Cancer (UICC) and the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) as the international PM staging system for the sixth and seventh editions of their stage classi/uniFB01 cation manuals. 9,14 Pleural thickness measurements were collected for the /uniFB01 rst time as a potential T category descriptor in the IASLC PM database used to develop the\neighth edition of the TNM staging system. 1,15 Exploratory analyses revealed that pleural thickness measurements had prognostic signi /uniFB01 cance, and a plan was formulated to collect more comprehensive data to support developing the ninth edition stage classi /uniFB01 cation system.\nTumor volume, assessed from three-dimensional segmentation of the whole tumor on computed tomography (CT), has been explored as a surrogate of tumor size, and several centers of excellence use tumor volume to stratify patients. 15 -18 The feasibility of incorporating tumor volume as a T descriptor was explored in a North American multi-institutional pilot study and found to be promising. 3,4 Nevertheless, not all centers have the appropriate software or technical expertise for volumetric measurement of mesothelioma. For ubiquitous applicability, a simpler approach to assessment of tumor size in PM that can provide prognostic information is needed. Therefore, for the ninth edition of the PM stage classi /uniFB01 cation, both pleural thickness measurements on CT and the existing clinical T (cT) descriptors were analyzed to re /uniFB01 ne cT categories. CT was the imaging modality selected because it is available worldwide and is widely acknowledged as pivotal for clinical stage assessment. 19,20",

Data contribution was solicited from investigators from centers across the world treating patients with PM. Demographic and clinical information, clinical and pathologic stage (TNM eighth edition UICC AJCC), treatment, and survival data were collected. Data entry through an electronic data capture (EDC) system designed by the Cancer Research And Biostatistics (CRAB) was the preferred method of data submission; alternatively, the transfer of external institutional data, termed ' batch ' data, was also permitted. 21\nInclusion criteria for the initial cT category analysis included histologically or cytologically con /uniFB01 rmed PM classi /uniFB01 ed as M0 by the eighth edition of TNM. Participants were eligible for the pathologic T (pT) category analysis if they had undergone surgical resection, were M0, did not receive neoadjuvant therapy, had information regarding /uniFB01 ssure involvement if pT1, and had a pT category by eighth edition, which matched any pT descriptors provided (Fig. 1).",

      "content": "PM has several inherent characteristics that affected the decision-making process of the mesothelioma\ndomain. Experience has revealed that qualitative assessment of imaging poorly correlates with tissue invasion (unless it is quite extensive); hence, a quantitative method of categorizing tumor extent for clinical stage is needed. Quanti /uniFB01 cation of tumor thickness or volume at resection (on pathologic specimens), however, has proven to be problematic, because en bloc removal of tumor is often not feasible. Therefore, for PM, there is an inherent difference between clinical assessment of tumor burden and pathologic assessment. Many patients are managed without surgery; hence, the major focus was on the de /uniFB01 -nition of clinical T descriptors and categories.\nPossible de /uniFB01 nitions of T category were explored, including factors suggested by previously published literature and de /uniFB01 ned by analysis of the IASLC database. Practical considerations included evidence regarding consistency of measurements and feasibility across regions of the world. A candidate T classi /uniFB01 cation system was required to reveal stepwise ordering, discrimination between adjacent categories, and consistency across regions and histologic types of PM.",

The site radiologists helped capture the quantitative metrics. The chest was divided into three compartments with a virtual demarcation at the level of the top of the arch of the aorta and the /uniFB01 rst image at or below the level of the left atrium, dividing the chest into three relatively equal parts (Fig. 2 A -C ). The maximum pleural thickness measurements were assessed on axial images perpendicular to the chest wall or mediastinum in the area of maximal pleural thickness in each third of the hemithorax (pmax1, pmax2, and pmax3) and combined to estimate the sum of the maximal pleural thickness at the three levels (Psum ¼ pmax1 þ pmax2 þ pmax3). Maximal pleural thickness was also measured along the /uniFB01 ssures (Fmax) and diaphragm (Dmax) on sagittal images at sites of maximum thickness (Fig. 2 A -C ).\nInvolvement of the /uniFB01 ssure was de /uniFB01 ned as maximum pleural thickness along the /uniFB01 ssures (Fmax) measuring\nmore than 5 mm or documented as ' present ' in the absence of measured thickness. This cutpoint for /uniFB01 ssure thickness was based on previous published work and was also close to the optimal cutpoint of 8 mm ( p ¼ 0.007) in the ninth edition IASLC database. 15 The relationship between Dmax and nontransmural invasion of the diaphragm is less well understood. In a univariate analysis of overall survival (OS), an optimal cutpoint of 6.8 mm was identi /uniFB01 ed in the 889 patients with Dmax measurements. Nevertheless, due to the lack of Dmax measurements in approximately half of the samples prevented inclusion of Dmax in the multivariable\nanalyses.

      "content": "Of the 3598 patients who met the general screening requirements for the project, 3055 patients were M0 at presentation and 2886 met the initial inclusion criteria for cT category analysis. Of these, 1965 patients comprised the /uniFB01 nal cohort analyzed for proposed cT and 457 patients were eligible for analysis of pT (Fig. 1). Most patients were treated in Asia, North America, and Europe, with smaller cohorts from Australia and South America. Patient demographics for both cohorts cT and pT are\nlisted in Table 1. Psum was available for 1790 patients and ranged from 0.4 to 462.7 mm with an average of 45.5 mm. Dmax measurements were available for 889 patients with an average measurement of 11.3 mm (0 -96 mm). Fmax measurements were available for 877 patients with an average measurement of 9.6 mm (0 -64.8 mm).\nInitial evaluation of the cT data revealed that both Psum and extent of the primary tumor (involvement of anatomic structures) were useful in constructing distinct T categories with respect to OS. The OS for patients deemed to have T1 tumors but accompanied by /uniFB01 ssure thickness greater than 5 mm was similar to eighth edition T2 category, suggesting the presence of /uniFB01 ssure involvement as an independent predictor of worse prognosis irrespective of Psum (Supplementary Fig. 1).\nIn the exploratory analyses performed for the eighth edition, Psum cutpoints of less than 13 mm, 13 to 60 mm, and more than 60 mm were identi /uniFB01 ed. 1 These Psum cutpoints separated the ninth edition data into three distinct groups as well (Supplementary Fig. 2), although a side-by-side comparison of survival by cutpoint groups by the ninth edition versus by the eighth edition T (modi /uniFB01 ed by removing the three descriptors -endothoracic fascia, lung parenchyma, and nontransmural diaphragm) suggested that patients with T4 disease represented a risk group with particularly poor prognosis that was not identi /uniFB01 ed based on pleural thickness cutpoints alone. The qualitative component of T was thus divided into the following three groups: Group 1. ' Low, ' that is, T1 or T2 tumors with no involvement of the /uniFB01 ssure or T3 solely by invasion of the endothoracic fascia. Group 2. ' Medium, ' that is, all other T1 to T3 tumors. Group 3. ' High, ' that is, T4 tumors.\nRecursive partitioning applied to the ninth edition data suggested that OS for patients with ' High T ' (T4) tumors was distinct irrespective of pleural thickness. The optimal cutpoints of less than 12.2 mm, greater than or equal to 12.2 mm, and less than 31 mm and greater than or equal to 31 mm for Psum were useful in reclassifying the remaining tumors into proposed T1, T2, or T3 categories (Fig. 3 A -C ). In accordance with the convention of placing the equal sign on the upper bound, the boundary of less than 12.2 mm was changed to less than or equal to 12 mm, and the boundary less than 31 mm was changed to less than or equal to 30 mm.\nThe proposed de /uniFB01 nitions for cT for the ninth edition are summarized in Table 2 (Supplementary Fig. 1) . Comparison of the proposed de /uniFB01 nitions for cT and pT with the eighth edition is summarized in Supplementary Table 1. Using these de /uniFB01 nitions, median OS for patients with T1 tumors was 49.8 months, 27.5 months for T2, 21.1 months for T3, and 12.6 months for T4. All comparisons of OS between proposed T categories were statistically signi /uniFB01 cant, whereas OS was not signi /uniFB01 cantly\ndifferent for eighth edition T2 versus T3 (Table 3). The proposed ninth edition cT was validated in the eighth edition data set, again revealing better separation of the curves for the proposed new T categories in the eighth edition data set when compared with the eighth edition T categories (Fig. 4 A -D ).\nThe pT category was analyzed in 457 patients with data available for assessment by the proposed cT (ninth edition) (Fig. 1). The OS curves for the proposed pT (ninth edition) among the 457 patients revealed similar separation between the pT categories when compared with the eighth edition, as only nine patients were reclassi /uniFB01 ed from pT1 by the eighth edition to pT2 by the proposed ninth edition (Fig. 4 E and F ; Table 3). Given the lack of anatomic structural orientation in most pleural resection specimens, particularly when resections are performed by some form of pleurectomy/decortication\n(P/D), it is not possible to correlate pathologic size of pleural thickening to CT estimation of pleural thickness within each of the three levels. Therefore, the qualitative pT descriptors used in the eighth edition are maintained in the proposed ninth edition of the staging system, with the exception of /uniFB01 ssure involvement designating T2 rather than T1 category.\nConsistency was assessed through further analyses which con /uniFB01 rmed that discrimination between the proposed new clinical T categories was upheld in all geographical regions and for both epithelioid and nonepithelioid tumors, although the numbers of nonepithelioid tumors were small (Supplementary Figs. 3 -7).",

Implicit in this proposal is the acknowledgment that some of the previous T descriptors of anatomical invasion, developed through surgical databases, do not lend themselves to assessment using CT imaging. Thus, these proposed ninth edition clinical T descriptors and categories are a major step toward clinical applicability. Implementation of the proposed cT categories will require education of the radiology and the oncology communities about how staging measurements should be performed, what imaging /uniFB01 ndings constitute /uniFB01 ssural invasion, and a worldwide change of practice in radiologic reporting of the initial CT scan for patients with PM.\nThe proposed pT category remains similar to the eighth edition, although pathologic involvement of the /uniFB01 ssure has been moved to pT2 category to align with the cT category. Surgical/pathologic pleural tumor thickness was not collected for this data set. Although there was considerable discussion about the potential applicability of tumor thickness measurements to patients with PM undergoing resection, this cannot be applied in routine practice. Tumor is rarely removed as an intact single\nspecimen, thereby precluding reliable measurement of a ' maximal pleural thickness ' at prespeci /uniFB01 ed locations in surgical specimens. Alternative metrics such as surgical tumor volume or weight would be similarly challenging, as different surgical procedures may remove adjacent organs (pericardium, diaphragm, lung parenchyma) and may not be amenable to complete gross tumor removal, making it dif /uniFB01 cult to compare across different procedures. Hence, the practical approach is to have distinct rules for the assessment of cT and pT, as with several other malignancies.\nFor cancers of the lip, oral cavity, and skin, cN and pN categories differ according to the quanti /uniFB01 cation of nodal disease. 26 For cancers of the breast, penis, testes, and urinary system, the number of involved lymph nodes is a pathologic descriptor, only, and not a clinical descriptor. 27,28 In tumors with complex morphology such as ovarian cancer and peritoneal mesothelioma in which exact size cannot be determined, the TNM systems have not been found to be useful, and alternate stage classi /uniFB01 cation systems are more popular. 29,30\nThe cT categories performed better than the pT categories in prognostication, which may be related to\nA",

Importantly, the proposal also performed better than eighth edition cT when applied to the eighth edition data, revealing a signi /uniFB01 cant difference in OS for T1 versus T2 and better separation of T2 versus T3. Another factor may be related to the trend in the last decade of proportionately fewer surgical patients undergoing EPP, with only 158 (15%) of patients in the current study, thus providing less complete information regarding pathologic stage than historic data sets involving more of such specimens. With a relatively higher proportion of surgical patients undergoing P/D, key pathologic information such as invasion of mediastinal fat, endothoracic fascia invasion, presence of pericardial effusion, and orientation of pleural tumor may not be available from surgical",

In comparison, overall tumor bulk or tumor volume can be assessed from imaging, especially using the simpli /uniFB01 ed approach of dividing the chest into three equal parts and measuring pleural thickness at three sites generating a maximum pleural thickness, which is a surrogate for tumor size.\nTumor volume, a surrogate for tumor burden, has been found to be prognostic in a number of studies and has revealed to predict survival and time to recurrence 4,15,16,31 -33 in both surgical and nonsurgical patients, and thus con /uniFB01 rming the need for a size descriptor for the T category. Although tumor volume measurements have potential as a more accurate predictor of survival, as yet there is neither standardization of volumetric techniques nor can all sites measure volume on CT scan. Therefore, in order for widespread use in a stage classi /uniFB01 cation system, a simple approach that has potential for widespread adoption is needed. Unidimensional pleural thickness measurements were initially explored during the eight edition revision and found to be promising. An international collaborative effort to collect pleural thickness measurements has now con /uniFB01 rmed the initial /uniFB01 ndings in the eighth edition data, and we conclude that tumor size category in addition to /uniFB01 ssural invasion is the best current clinical T category descriptor.\nMesothelioma in situ (potentially cTis/pTis) has recently been recognized as a distinct entity and is regarded as a precursor to invasive mesothelioma. 34 The diagnosis can be challenging and requires multidisciplinary correlation among histologic, immunohistochemical, and/or molecular, clinical, and radiologic /uniFB01 ndings. It is usually characterized by the presence of effusion in the absence of pleural thickening, minimal changes in pleural appearance on video thoracoscopy, and subtle pathologic abnormalities, characterized by BAP1, MTAP loss by immunohistochemistry or homozygous deletion CDKN 2a in the absence of invasion. 35 This data set was not designed to collect information about this category. Future investigations for the tenth edition of the stage classi /uniFB01 cation system may elucidate this proposed category further.\nIn conclusion, for the ninth edition of the stage classi /uniFB01 cation system, we propose a cT category based on a combination of both unidimensional measurements of pleural thickness and invasion of adjacent planes and organs. This improves prognostic strati /uniFB01 cation across cT categories substantially, relative to the eighth edition AJCC/UICC cT categories. Thus, it will improve strati /uniFB01 -cation of patients entering clinical trials and may improve the selection of treatment for patients in routine practice.",
