Complications related to rigid bronchoscopy are uncommon in the hands of trained physicians. Traditionally, rigid bronchoscopy is performed in the operating room rather than the bronchoscopy suite based on the availability of advanced airway equipment and additional anesthesia support. This study assesses the safety and feasibility of performing rigid bronchoscopy on non-critically ill patients in the bronchoscopy suite. The aim of this study is to determine the safety of performing rigid bronchoscopy in a bronchoscopy suite, outside of an operating room setting.\nMethods: This is a retrospective, single-center analysis of 372 rigid bronchoscopy procedures performed for complex airway interventions in the bronchoscopy suite over a 5-year period. The primary endpoint of this study was the safety of performing rigid bronchoscopy in the bronchoscopy suite. In this analysis, safety data was collected regarding intraoperative and post-operative complications of rigid bronchoscopies performed in the bronchoscopy suite.\nResults: Over a 5-year period between January 2019 and March 2024, 372 rigid bronchoscopies were performed in the bronchoscopy suite for non-emergent complex airway diseases. The overall incidence of intraprocedural complications in our cohort was 2 out of 372 procedures (0.5%). The two intraprocedural complications were pulmonary hemorrhage in 1 patient and cardiac ischemia in 1 patient. No incidence of airway injury, cardiac arrest, or death were observed. Seven procedures (1.9%) were followed by a change in clinical status requiring increased respiratory support within 24 hours of the rigid bronchoscopy.\nConclusions: Rigid bronchoscopy for the treatment of complex airway diseases, in the appropriate patient population, can be performed safely in the bronchoscopy suite.\nKeywords: Rigid bronchoscopy; bronchoscopy suite; airway obstruction\nSubmitted Dec 12, 2024.

The most common mechanical complications include trauma to the teeth, oropharynx, vocal cords or other glottic structures, laryngospasm, pneumothorax, hemorrhage, and death (8,9). The incidence of serious complications is less than 2%, with the incidence of death related to the procedure of 0.4% (10,11).\nTraditionally, rigid bronchoscopy is performed in the operating room with general anesthesia. Alternative settings and anesthesia support have been implemented during rigid bronchoscopy, such as bedside procedures or in the absence of anesthesia (12,13). Still, the operating room setting has been the norm for the availability of advanced airway equipment and additional anesthesia support. While procedures on critically ill patients may be best served in the operating room, unnecessary use of this location consumes\nsignificant resources and can come at an increased cost. Additionally, limited availability of dedicated operating room time for bronchoscopy could prevent adequate access for these procedures. Because the use of general anesthesia is standard practice for rigid and flexible bronchoscopy, the same advanced airway equipment found in the operating room is present in the bronchoscopy suite (14). With appropriate patient selection, experienced proceduralists and anesthesiologists can safely perform rigid bronchoscopy in the bronchoscopy suite rather than the operating room.\nThis  study  assesses  the  safety  and  feasibility  of performing rigid bronchoscopy on non-critically ill patients in the bronchoscopy suite. We believe that performing rigid bronchoscopies for complex airway diseases can be safely performed in the bronchoscopy suite rather than the operating room setting. The analysis will provide physicians with justification for incorporating the practice of rigid bronchoscopy outside of the operating room at their own institutions. We present this article in accordance with the STROBE reporting checklist (available at https://jtd. amegroups.com/article/view/10.21037/jtd-2024-2163/rc).",

      "content": "Over a 5-year period between January 2019 and March 2024, 667 rigid bronchoscopies were performed at our institution. Three-hundred and seventy-two of these rigid bronchoscopies were performed in the bronchoscopy suite for non-emergent complex airway diseases. Patient demographic data is listed in Table 1 ;  37.4% of the cohort underwent rigid bronchoscopy during an inpatient admission, while 62.6% were outpatients during the procedure. Assessment of patient risk of complications during anesthesia and surgery was described by an ASA score of 1 to 5, with 1 being low risk and 5 being high risk. One patient had an ASA score of 1 (0.3%), 7 had an ASA score of 2 (1.9%), 312 had an ASA score of 3 (83.9%), and 52 had an ASA score of 4 (14%). No patients had an ASA score of 5 (0.0%). The indication for rigid bronchoscopy was malignant endobronchial airway obstruction (266 patients, 71.5%), airway stenosis (150 patients, 40.3%), hemoptysis (32 patients, 8.6%), foreign body (78 patients, 21%), complications following lung transplant including anastomotic stenosis, anastomotic malacia, and dehiscence requirement stent placement (59 patients, 15.9%), and indication listed as 'other' (14 patients, 3.8%) ( Table 2 ).\nThe various maneuvers performed during rigid bronchoscopies included thermal therapy (argon plasma coagulation, neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet\nData are presented as number, mean ± standard deviation, or n (%).

The two intraprocedural complications were pulmonary hemorrhage in 1 patient and cardiac ischemia in 1 patient. Cardiac ischemia during the rigid bronchoscopy was diagnosed by  the  presence  of  new  T-waves  on  intraoperative electrocardiogram (EKG) which were previously absent. Neither of these complications led to death. No incidence of airway injury, cardiac arrest, or death were observed. Seven procedures (1.9%) were followed by a change in clinical status within 24 hours of the rigid bronchoscopy. Six of these changes were due to new respiratory failure requiring intubation, high-flow nasal canula, or bi-level ventilation (85.7%). In the 24 hours following the rigid bronchoscopy, no patients suffered cardiac arrest.",

      "title": "Discussion",
      "content": "Performing rigid bronchoscopy in the bronchoscopy suite is safe in the appropriate patient population with a  team of skilled practitioners. Our study describes a low incidence of intraoperative complications and a low risk for clinical decompensation within 24 hours of the\nprocedure. In addition to the safety profile, important factors such as conservation of hospital resources and financial sustainability are benefits of performing rigid bronchoscopies outside of the operating room.\nAs mentioned previously, the incidence of serious complications during rigid bronchoscopy is less than 2%, with the incidence of death being 0.4% (11,12). In this study, the incidence of serious complications such as death, hemorrhage, or pneumothorax during rigid bronchoscopy in the bronchoscopy suite was 0.5% with zero deaths. This indicates that in the correct patient populations, physicians can safely that rigid bronchoscopy can be performed outside  of  the  operating  room.  Most  patients  were designated as ASA 3 risks, were not critically ill, and were deemed hemodynamically stable prior to their procedure. Fourteen percent of our cohort were ASA 4 risks and did have the potential for serious complications or deaths. We believe that the risk to patient safety when performing rigid bronchoscopy in the bronchoscopy suite can be minimized in appropriately selected patient populations and clinical excellence on the part of the proceduralist and anesthesiologist.\nThe bronchoscopic maneuvers and tools used during rigid bronchoscopy in the bronchoscopy suite were the same as those used in the operating room, without change in procedural practice. The current cohort underwent rigid bronchoscopy for the treatment of airway obstructions, hemoptysis, airway complications following lung transplant (both early and late post-transplant period), bronchial and tracheal stenosis, and foreign body removal. Treatment of these conditions required thermal therapies, balloon dilation, cryotherapy and debulking, and stent placement. Traditionally, thermal therapy or stent placement for airway obstruction are performed in the operating room due to potential risk of airway complications. This study demonstrates the ability to emulate the patient care in the bronchoscopy suite is dictated by the equipment, treatment tools, and the personnel involved. Typically, the limiting factor of performing various maneuvers is the availability of the capital equipment to perform these procedures in the bronchoscopy suite.\nModern bronchoscopy suites and operating rooms have similar capabilities. Rigid bronchoscopy, by standard practice, requires specialized equipment and general anesthesia. Most advanced bronchoscopy suites are outfitted with this equipment, including bronchoscopy towers, video assisted thoracoscopic surgical cameras and telescopes, video laryngoscopes, anesthesia machines, jet ventilators,\nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), endobronchial ultrasound.\nand difficult airway carts. While cardiopulmonary bypass support is not normally available in bronchoscopy suites, this  equipment is unnecessary for hemodynamically stable  patients.  In  circumstances  when  appropriate rigid bronchoscopy equipment is not available in the bronchoscopy suite, it can be purchased or shared from the operating room. Additionally, interventional pulmonologists trained in advanced airway procedures offer excellent support for anesthesiologists in situations where a difficult airway may be encountered.\nIn addition to the safety, performing rigid bronchoscopy outside of the operating room may carry substantial financial benefits for a hospital system. The disparity between the cost-per-minute of using the operating room versus the bronchoscopy suite can be significant (15). While our medical center invested approximately $160,000 in capital costs to purchase video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) cameras, telescopes, bronchoscopy towers, rigid bronchoscopes, and a jet ventilator to be used in the bronchoscopy suite. Furthermore, direct costs are the costs attributed directly to any procedure such as disposable tools and use of procedural space. The direct cost attributed to the operating room is primarily related to physical space utilization and specialized nursing. The contribution margin is a key performance indicator for procedural sustainability and profitability. Contribution margin is calculated by subtracting variable direct cost for a procedure from the adjusted gross revenue collected. Rigid bronchoscopies performed in the bronchoscopy suite significantly reduces direct cost by utilizing a less costly space and no specialized intraoperative nursing. As a result, the contribution margin of a rigid bronchoscopy performed in the bronchoscopy suite is significantly higher than cases performed in the operating room. Performing rigid bronchoscopies in the bronchoscopy suite resulted in a direct cost reduction of approximately $2,000 per case. As a result, performing 80 rigid bronchoscopies in the bronchoscopy suite resulted in a direct cost reduction equivalent to the cost of the capital investment for new equipment.\nLimitation of our study is the retrospective, singlecenter nature of the analysis. Physicians performing these procedures were fellowship trained in interventional pulmonology. Additionally, patients who were critically ill,  deemed hemodynamically unstable, or had concern for potential difficult airways were excluded from our analysis. Procedures for these patients were performed in the operating room. As a result, compared to all rigid bronchoscopy procedures performed at Inova Fairfax\nMedical Center, the risk for complications in this cohort may have been significantly lower, resulting in fewer poor intraoperative and post-operative outcomes.",
