      "title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "content": "The primary indication for enteral and parenteral feeding is the provision of  nutritional support to meet metabolic requirements for patients with inadequate oral intake. Enteral feeding is usually the preferred method over parenteral feeding in patients with a functional gastrointestinal (GI) system due to the associated risks of  the intravenous route, higher cost and inability of  parenteral nutrition to provide enteral stimulation and subsequent compromise of the gut defense barrier [1,2] . Moreover, it has been shown that enteric feeding can decrease the risk of  bacterial translocation and corresponding bacteremia [3] .  Tube feeding through the GI tract is mainly considered in patients with insufficient oral intake who have a functional GI system and tube insertion into their alimentary tract can be safely maintained.\nGastric feeding is the most common type of enteral feeding. Access to insert the gastrostomy tube can be achieved by the use of endoscopy, radiological imaging, or surgical techniques (open or laparoscopic). Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) was first introduced in 1980 by the application of endoscopy to insert a feeding tube into the stomach [4] . Due to low cost, less invasive and no need for general anesthesia in most cases (which is  a  challenging factor in debilitated patients in whom gastrostomy tubes are most commonly placed), PEG is considered to be a better choice for the introduction of  a feeding tube than surgical methods [5,6] .  PEG is currently the method of choice for medium- and long-term enteral feeding.\nThis article reviews the current knowledge on PEG in the medical literature.",

      "title": "INDICATIONS AND EFFICACY",
      "content": "Patients with adequate baseline nutritional status can tolerate up to 10 d of  partial fasting (with maintenance fluids) before severe protein catabolism occurs. However, longer fasting periods, depending on the patient's baseline health status, can be unfavorable. To maintain or establish adequate nutrition, enteral feeding is necessary for patients with insufficient oral intake. Nasoenteric tubes\n(nasogastric, nasoduodenal and nasojejunal) are usually reserved for short-term (< 30 d) enteral feeding in patients with intact protective airway reflexes.\nCompared to PEG tubes, nasoenteric tubes result in more complications (irritation, ulceration, bleeding, esophageal reflux and aspiration pneumonia), lower subjective comfort and even lower feeding efficacy [7-9] . Hence, PEG tube insertion is usually considered in pa -tients at risk for moderate to severe malnourishment within 2-3 wk of  nasoenteric tube feeding. However, there are unclear benefits of  PEG feeding in certain patient populations, such as those with diabetes or advanced dementia and in elderly patients aged more than 80 years [10,11] . The decision for tube placement should be individualized according to the patient's needs, preferences, diagnosis and life expectancy. The goal is not only to improve the patient's survival and nutritional status, but also to improve their quality of  life which is not necessarily correlated with nutritional improvement [12] .  Also the long-term survival rate of  some patients is low due to their underlying disease and this needs to be considered when deciding on PEG placement [11] .\nThere are a significant number of patients who can benefit medically from PEG placement (Table 1). In a 4-year prospective study of  210 patients with both malignant and benign underlying diseases, the mean weight loss in the three-month period before starting PEG tube nutrition was 11.35 ± 1.5 kg, while the mean weight gain at the end of 12-mo feeding via PEG tube was 3.5",

Dysphagia is a common finding after a stroke and it's incidence is reported to be as high as 45% among those admitted to hospital [15] .  Some ex -perts recommend that patients who are not able to meet their nutritional needs by oral intake, should be started on nasogastric (NG) tube feeding in the first 24 h after their stroke [16] . Nasogastric tube feeding alone may be enough in patients who need nutritional support for less than 4 wk, but PEG tube placement needs to be considered for longer periods [17] .  PEG feeding provides a safe and reliable means of nutrition in stroke patients and its superior long-term results over NG tube feeding have been demonstrated [18,19] .  Early PEG nutrition is also desirable in stroke patients, but the decision must be weighed up in patients with temporary dysphagia or those with short life expectancy due to underlying diseases. At least a twoweek wait time for PEG insertion is clinically appropriate to evaluate its medical necessity. After insertion of the PEG tube, routine follow-up of patients should be carried out to evaluate regaining their swallowing ability. PEG tubes can be removed at any time if patients regain spontaneous swallowing.",

      "content": "PEG is a standard method of feeding in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In some patients the PEG tube placement technique should be modified in view of  associated anatomic deformity. Also gastric insufflation during and after the procedure should be minimized due to the inability of these patients to spontaneously lower their raised diaphragm [20] . Although there are some concerns about the safety of PEG tube placement in patients with restricted pulmonary function, Czell et al [21] showed that PEG can be performed in these patients under procedural non-invasive ventilation with minimal peri- and post-procedural complications. In addition their data showed no significant difference in longterm survival rate among patients with high (> 50%) and low (< 50%) forced vital capacity (FVC). This finding was in contrast to the results of  other studies showing a lower survival rate after PEG tube placement in patients with ALS who had low FVC (< 50%) [22] .\nThe role of  the PEG tube has also been described in the nutritional support of  other motor neuron and dysfunctional motor diseases such as cerebral palsy and\nbulbar palsy [23-25] . These patients frequently have feeding and swallowing problems that may lead to poor nutritional status, growth failure, chronic pulmonary aspiration and infection. The Epidemiologic Oxford Feeding Study reported a significant correlation between the severity of  motor impairments and the need for gastrostomy feeding [26] .",

      "content": "Most patients with advanced dementia are dependent on others in their daily living activities including eating. In a prospective study of  nursing home residents, 86% of patients with advanced dementia had eating problems [27] . There are several mechanisms that are responsible for impaired self-feeding in this population: altered smell and anorexia resulting in a lack of  interest in food; apraxia interfering with the task of  eating, and dysphagia and loss of  airway protective mechanisms leading to choking episodes and eating avoidance [28-30] .  Feeding problems are usually considered one of the ominous symptoms of advanced dementia with a 6 mo mortality rate of 25% [27] , a similar life expectancy to some generally considered poor prognosis diseases such as stage 4 congestive heart failure [31] .  This is consistent with the finding that independent of age, patients with dementia undergoing PEG have a worse prognosis than other patient subgroups with a mortality rate of  54% after 1 mo and 90% after 1 year of  tube insertion [32] .  In another study cited elsewhere, PEG has a higher mortality rate in demented patients who are at least 80 years old [11] . The need for more aggressive palliative measures to prevent malnutrition in patients with advanced dementia is an important issue, however to date, there is no published evidence showing that PEG feeding can prolong survival or provide palliation in this patient population [33-36] .  In a recent study designed to assess the effect of  PEG feeding on pressure ulcer healing in patients with advanced dementia, patients with PEG were less likely to heal and more likely to develop new ulcers [37] .  Given all these findings, PEG may not provide any clinical benefit to this patient population and simple efforts like hand feeding can be a viable alternative [38] . In one study, PEG tube insertion in nursing home residents with advanced dementia was associated with a significant increase in annual inpatient health care costs as well as in hospital and intensive care unit stay [39] .",

In obese patients, PEG can be safely performed with minor modifications, even in patients with an extreme body mass index (> 60 kg/m 2 ) [60,61] .\nDuring pregnancy, PEG tube insertion may be complicated by potential risks of  uterine and fetal injury. However, tube insertion has been reported in pregnant women up to 29-wk gestation with no major complication after applying special precautions [62-65] .\nGenerally, ascites is considered a relative contraindication for PEG tube placement due to concerns regarding ascitic fluid leakage. There are some case reports of  suc -cessful tube insertion, after paracentesis or modifications of the placement technique, even in patients with massive ascites [66-68] . However, in a case series of  patients with cir -rhosis, the patient group with ascites had a higher mortality rate. Therefore, experts have concluded that the risks of PEG tube insertion in cirrhotic patients with ascites outweigh its overall benefits [69] .\nWhen medically indicated, there is no age or weight limit in PEG tube placement. The safety of PEG inser-\ntime and the final outcome is not clear. Generally, in or -der to prevent nutrition depletion, enteral feeding should be started as early as possible to restore physiological function of the GI system. Some authors advocate that PEG tube nutrition should be started in severe cerebral injury patients if  they do not recover in 14 d [41] .",

Also few cases of complete laceration of the stomach following tube insertion have been reported in the literature [83] .  Iatrogenic perforation of the bowels during PEG tube insertion is more common among elderly patients due to laxity of the colonic mesentery [84] .  Patients with bowel injury may develop the classic signs of  peritoneal irritation. How -ever, in some instances, the diagnosis is challenging since candidates for PEG tube nutrition do not always communicate easily due to their underlying altered mental status. In addition, the persistence of  transient subclinical pneumoperitoneum occurring during PEG [85] limits the utility of  plain films in the diagnosis of  suspected visceral perforation. A watchful follow-up is important after any PEG tube insertion and there should be a low threshold for further investigation. Performing a computed tomography (CT) scan with water-soluble contrast, or fluoroscopy in the case of hemodynamic instability, is a useful alternative to confirm gastrointestinal integrity in this setting. Any evidence of  active leakage of  contrast into the peritoneal cavity in the presence of  the signs of peritonitis warrants emergent surgical intervention.",

The prevalence varies between 5%-25% in different studies, and in some series it was reported to be as high as 65% [111,112] . Although mild redness around the stoma site is common due to tube movement, extension of  the redness and addition of purulent discharge or other signs of systemic inflamma -tion should raise suspicion regarding wound infection. Minor infections usually resolve with the application of local antiseptics and daily dressing changes, but in cases\nof persistent infection further investigation is warranted. Periostomal swabs, although considered to have restricted results, can be cultured to tailor the systemic or local antibiotic treatments. The effectiveness of  prophylactic antibiotic administration in preventing systemic and local infection has been studied in several articles [112-119] . A systematic review of ten eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which evaluated prophylactic antimicrobials in 1100 patients, showed a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of  periostomal infection with prophylactic antibiotics (pooled Odds ratio (OR) = 0.31, 95%CI: 0.22-0.44) [120] .\nThe current gold standard for antibiotic prophylaxis is the intravenous administration of a single dose of  cephalosporins in the first hour before PEG tube insertion. Re -cent efforts in exploring other prophylactic alternatives, found co-trimoxazole administered immediately via a newly inserted PEG catheter just as effective in preventing periostomal infection [121,122] .\nThe recent emergence of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a PEG-site infection pathogen, generally resistant to cephalosporins, has raised concerns over the use of prophylactic antimicrobials. Some studies showed benefits of pre-PEG MRSA screening and naso -pharyngeal decolonization of MRSA in reducing periostomal wound infection rate [123,124] .",

Evaluation of the leakage should include examination of the patient for any evidence of infection, ulceration, buried bumper [83] or any other potential causes such as tube displacement, slowed gastric emptying, ex -cessive gavage or residual, and enlarged gastric fistula. Intervention generally starts with meticulous prevention and continues with treatment of specific causes including underlying disease [125] . Inserting a larger tube through the same PEG tube tract will create more problems such as further tissue breakdown resulting in an even larger stoma. In patients with a mature PEG tract, the PEG tube can be completely removed, allowing the tract to close completely. When medically indicated, another PEG tube can then be placed in another location on the abdominal wall.",

Obtaining consent from this population can be complicated. Several studies suggest that the quality of informed consent in patients undergoing PEG is inadequate [135,136] .

      "content": "Since its introduction by Gauderer et al [4] , several different techniques have been developed to insert the PEG tube. Generally, all of  these methods share a common concept of  insertion of  the gastrostomy tube through the abdominal wall at a point where the stomach and abdominal wall are in closest contact. Herein, we briefly describe the 3 most commonly used techniques in clinical practice: 'pull' technique, 'push' (guide wire) technique and in -troducer (Russell) method. Finding the tube insertion site on the abdominal wall by endoscopic trans-illumination and one to one indentation is the first critical step in all these techniques.\nThe 'pull' technique is the method initially introduced by Gauderer et al [4] and is currently considered to be the most common technique utilized to insert the PEG tube. In this method a string is inserted through a needle in the abdominal wall into the stomach, grasped with endoscopic biopsy forceps and then taken out through the esophagus and mouth. Subsequently the string is fixed to the external end of the feeding tube and the tube is pulled from the mouth to the esophagus, stomach and then out though the abdominal wall.\nThe first section of  the 'push' technique is similar to the 'pull' technique. A guide wire is inserted into the stomach and pulled out through the mouth with the endoscope. The feeding tube is pushed over the guide wire into the stomach and out the puncture site [138] . No significant differences in complication and efficacy rates between the pull and push methods have been reported [138,139] .\nTh introducer (Russell) technique [140] uses the Seldinger method to place a guide wire into the stomach under endoscopic view. Afterwards, a dilating catheter and sheath are passed over the guide wire and after removal of the guide wire the feeding tube is advanced through the peel-away sheath.\nLong-term protruding gastrostomy tubes may not be favorable in some patients due to the risk of  periostomal leakage, inadvertent catheter dislodgment and cosmetic issues. These regular tubes can be replaced by a skin level low profile button gastrostomy tube after maturation of the stoma canal upon request by selected patients [141-143] . Their higher cost and replacement, which is needed every 6 mo, limits their routine use and they are often reserved for adolescent patients for cosmetic reasons. Although one-step button gastrostomy tube insertion can be performed similar to the routine 'pull technique' PEG tube placement, it is generally recommended that it is carried out following complete maturation of the stoma [144] .",

      "title": "pOST-INSERTION CARE",
      "content": "After PEG tube insertion adequate pain relief should be administered. Many patients report abdominal discomfort after PEG insertion due to inflation of the stomach during the procedure. Traditionally, feeding was delayed until the next day due to the fear of  peritoneal leakage risk after feeding. Many studies investigated the safety of\nearly feeding from 1 h to 6 h after PEG insertion, including a meta-analysis which found that feeding initiated as early as 4 h after PEG placement is safe [145-150] .\nThe stoma should be examined (for signs such as pain, discoloration, swelling, exudation, pus and leakage around the stoma) and cleaned daily. The tube should be rotated about 180 degrees and moved up and down about 1-2 cm in the stoma site on a daily basis after the stoma has completely healed.\nThe tube should be flushed before and after each feed and administration of medicine to prevent clogging of the tube and subsequent blockage. This blockage occurs particularly in small-bore feeding tubes secondary to feeding with thick formulas, inadequately crushed medications or incompatibility between medications and enteral feeds. In addition to regular flushing of  the tube, dissolving medications in water before administration and preferential utilization of  liquid forms of medications over solid-based forms are other preventive measures that should be taken to prevent clogging of the tube. If  the tube is blocked, attempts can be made to clear it by attaching a 50 mL syringe filled with warm water to the tube and carrying out a pull and push technique. Gentle squeezing of  the tube can help in some cases. Using pancreatic enzymes mixed with bicarbonate solution, prior to flushing with warm water, has been shown to be an effective method for unclogging the tube in some studies [110,151] .",
