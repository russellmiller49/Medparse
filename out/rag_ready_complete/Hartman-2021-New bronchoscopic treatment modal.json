      "content": "In the past decade there has been a significant development in bronchoscopic treatments for emphysema. Multiple randomised controlled trials have been performed to evaluate bronchoscopic treatments such as coils, valves, vapour ablation, airway bypass stents and AeriSeal [1 -14]. These efforts have led to the inclusion of both coils and endobronchial valves in the 2017 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease therapeutic guidelines and the vapour ablation therapy in the 2019 guidelines [15, 16]. Effectively, these treatments all aim to treat the emphysemateous phenotype of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but their introduction has contributed to the knowledge necessary to develop innovative bronchoscopic approaches for the chronic bronchitis phenotype. In this article we review the current literature and discuss these very new bronchoscopic developments for the treatment of chronic bronchitis.",

Chronic bronchitis is characterised by airway inflammation,\nCopyright ©ERS 2021.

The main clinical features of chronic bronchitis, increased productive cough and dyspnoea, are associated with poor outcomes [19 -23]. For example, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with chronic bronchitis symptoms were found to have worse airflow obstruction, greater burden of respiratory symptoms such as dyspnoea, cough, wheeze and nasal symptoms, more physical activity limitation and a worse quality of life [21 -23]. Furthermore, it was shown that chronic cough and sputum production were associated with frequent Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations including exacerbations requiring hospitalisations [19 -22]. Chronic mucus hypersecretion was found to be associated with a faster decline in lung function [20]. According to a recently published review, the prevalence of chronic bronchitis in patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) ranges from 12% to 35% [24]. The treatment of chronic bronchitis is aimed at reducing the overproduction of mucus, its tenacity, cough, restoring ciliary transport and attenuating inflammation. The current treatment options for chronic bronchitis are smoking cessation, physical measures (such as chest physical therapy, high-frequency chest wall oscillation or flutter valve) and drug therapy (expectorants and mucolytics, methylxanthines and short- and long-acting β -adrenergic receptor agonists, anticholinergics, glucocorticoids, phosphodiesterase (PDE)-4 inhibitors, antioxidants and macrolides) [18]. However, there are no currently approved interventions that effectively address the airway metaplasia and mucus hypersecretion of chronic bronchitis, and despite much effort patients remain highly symptomatic. There is a need for alternative therapeutic strategies. The mucus overproduction in chronic bronchitis is mostly generated by the goblet cells located in the first to fifth generations (up to the subsegmental bronchus) [25], an area which is easily accessible for bronchoscopic treatment.",

This study showed that the treatment was technically feasible 93% of the time and that the treatment was safe and well tolerated at both doses used. During the study, one serious adverse event (gastroparesis) deemed to be related to the device/treatment occurred. The improvements in efficacy tended to be larger in the patients treated with the higher dose (20 W) (table 5). A small substudy of this cohort (n=7) showed that inflammatory markers measured in bronchial wash and brush specimens decreased 30 days after treatment, suggesting a mechanistic role of the treatment in modulating airways and possibly systemic inflammation [36]. Post hoc analyses of the same cohort showed that antimuscarinic medication provided a synergistic bronchodilatory effect to TLD alone, indicating the potential benefits of the combination of TLD treatment and inhaled long-acting muscarinic antagonists and highlighting the need for further research in this area [37].

Up to 3 years after treatment, five respiratory serious adverse events were reported. None were deemed to be related to the treatment.\nA second-generation TLD device was developed and the next trial was a 1:1 randomised blinded trial to investigate safety, feasibility and dosing (29 versus 32 W) of the treatment in 30 patients (NCT02058459; AIRFLOW 1) [39]. In an early phase of the trial, five patients experienced serious adverse events, after which the trial was stopped. After adding an oesophageal balloon during treatment to facilitate accurate measurement of the oesophago-to-electrode distance to avoid inadvertent capture of the gastric parasympathetic plexi, the trial continued. Patients were not treated in locations close to the oesophagus. Due to the gastrointestinal adverse events that occurred during this trial, an additional 16 patients were treated. The conclusion of the trial was that the safety and feasibility of the treatment was acceptable. No significant differences were found in safety or efficacy between the two doses used, but there was a trend towards superior efficacy in the higher-energy dose group (32 W). Afterwards, the AIRFLOW 2 trial was executed, including 82 patients in a multicentre randomised sham-controlled double-blinded trial comparing the treatment with standard of medical care [40]. The results of the trial at 1 year showed that the TLD treatment group experienced a significant lower number of respiratory events and the risk of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation requiring hospitalisation was significantly lower compared to the sham group.",

Figure 2 shows a schematic overview of the mechanisms of action of the treatment. Two distinct mechanisms of action can be distinguished. Metered cryospray, bronchial rheoplasty and Karakoca balloon desobstruction procedures are designed to ablate hyperplastic goblet cells and excess submucous glands, using three distinct strategies, and ultimately promoting healthy epithelial regeneration of the airway lining. TLD counteracts the elevated basal parasympathetic tone by interrupting the vagal nerve bilaterally, reducing mucus hypersecretion, smooth muscle contraction and airways inflammation.\nThe three treatments aimed at ' rejuvenation ' of the epithelial wall each use different techniques. The RejuvenAir system applies liquid nitrogen in a radial spray, bronchial rheoplasty delivers short-duration high-frequency energy using a basket electrode and the Karakoca balloon desobstruction applies mechanical pressure to the airway via an inflatable balloon. The published results of the RejuvenAir System Metered Cryospray treatment showed that the treatment is feasible and safe. This first study in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients showed a promising improvement in cough symptoms measured using multidimensional\nquestionnaires. The first results of the RheOx bronchial rheoplasty treatment showed that this treatment is technically feasible and has an acceptable safety profile. Furthermore, significant improvements in goblet cell hyperplasia and quality of life and were found. The Karakoca balloon desobstruction was published as single-centre; case-series are published with outcomes up to only 1 month after treatment. For all treatments, randomised controlled trials are needed to be able to draw conclusions regarding the safety, feasibility and efficacy of each treatment in the short and longer term. In the future, comparative trials will help to clarify which technique is the safest, most effective and results in a sustained regeneration of the epithelial wall that translates to clinically meaningful reduction in symptom burden. Additionally, if these treatments can indeed ' heal ' the injured epithelium, how durable are these benefits? Thus, potentially, repeated treatments may be needed.\nThe last treatment has a different mechanism of action, targeting the vagal nerve directly rather than the airway epithelial layer. Disruption of the vagal nerve may have effects on both efferent and afferent signalling downstream. Interruption of the efferent signal lowers the basal cholinergic tone, reducing smooth muscle contraction and airway resistance in addition to decreasing mucus production; effects that appear to be mediated by inflammatory modulation. Conversely, stimuli may induce local reflex-mediated contraction of airway smooth muscle [44] and disruption of this afferent signal may be blocked by the treatment as well, thus attenuating airway hyperresponsiveness. To date, studies of TLD have not focused on the chronic bronchitis phenotype, and the effects on symptoms, notably increased cough with mucus expectoration, are unknown and merit further enquiry. However, development of this innovative therapy is at a more advanced stage than other bronchoscopic treatments and the only one to have been evaluated in a double-blind sham-controlled randomised trial. This randomised controlled trial showed that patients who underwent TLD experienced a significantly lower number of respiratory events, and the risk of a Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation requiring hospitalisation was significantly lower compared to the sham group. The planned FDA trial will be valuable in confirming these results in a larger cohort. Furthermore, the impact of nerve regeneration in re-establishing parasympathetic connections influencing the durability of treatment effect is unknown and will require longer-term surveillance.\nA challenge in this field is the lack of a universally agreed definition of chronic bronchitis. As mentioned earlier, the prevalence of chronic bronchitis in patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is variably quoted as 12 -35% [24], in part a consequence of no consensus and a poor disease entity definition. The classic Reid definition, published in 1965, states that chronic bronchitis is diagnosed when chronic cough and sputum persists for ⩾ 3 months of the year for two consecutive years [24, 45]. Others include only the presence of bronchial hypersecretion or chronic cough or both [24]. Other options are the Reid index [46] or questionnaires, although to our knowledge no validated chronic bronchitis questionnaire is available. For example, defining chronic bronchitis using the SGRQ identified more subjects at risk of future exacerbations than the classic definition [47]. The definition used will have consequences for the study population selected for trials. Furthermore, the question arises which end-point(s) would be most suitable to measure treatment efficacy. Aside from confirming airflow limitation, there are no specific lung function tests for diagnosing chronic bronchitis, which remains largely a clinical diagnosis. In addition to exacerbation frequency, quantification of cough, sputum production, breathlessness and health-related quality of life using multidimensional validated disease-specific questionnaires represents the most valuable and accurate ways of characterising disease severity and treatment response. Furthermore, outcomes on a cellular level (for example bronchoscopic biopsies) could investigate the proof of principle of the proposed mechanism of action.\nIn conclusion, chronic bronchitis is a chronic, progressive and difficult-to-treat disease. Despite all efforts, patients remain highly symptomatic. The affected airways are centrally located and easily accessible to a bronchoscope. Currently, three bronchoscopic treatments directly targeting chronic bronchitis are in development, aiming to destroy hyperplastic goblet cells and excess submucous glands with three different techniques. These treatments are in the very early phase of research and improvements in quality of life have been reported, but little tangible effect on cough and sputum production. Another bronchoscopic treatment is TLD, which aims to decrease mucus production, reducing acetylcholine levels by ablating the vagal nerve. The development of this treatment is more advanced and promising effects are found on the frequency of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. However, this treatment is not specifically aimed at chronic bronchitis, but at Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in general, and the effects on chronic bronchitis symptoms are unknown. Future work is needed to include larger randomised controlled trials and should focus on the change in specific chronic bronchitis symptoms such as increased cough and sputum. Furthermore, investigating the sustainability of the effect and the potential of re-treatment needs to be included in these trials.\nAcknowledgements: The authors would like to thank Judith Hartman for the help with producing figure 2.\nConflict of interest: J.E.
