RESEARCH QUESTION: Is TXA effective and safe in controlling iatrogenic bleeding during FB compared with adrenaline? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a cluster-randomized, double-blind, single-center trial in a tertiary teaching hospital. Patients were randomized in weekly clusters to receive up to three applications of TXA (100 mg, 2 mL) or adrenaline (0.2 mg, 2 mL, 1:10000) after hemostasis failure after three applications of cold saline (4 ° C, 5 mL). Crossover was allowed (for up to three further applications) before proceeding with other interventions. Bleeding severity was graded by the bronchoscopist using a visual analog scale (VAS; 1 = very mild, 10 = severe). RESULTS: A total of 2,033 FBs were performed and 130 patients were randomized successfully to adrenaline (n = 65) or TXA (n = 65), whereas 12 patients had to be excluded for protocol violations (two patients from the adrenaline arm and 10 patients from TXA arm). Bleeding was stopped in 83.1% of patients (54/65) in both groups (P = 1). The severity of bleeding and number of applications needed for bleeding control were similar in both groups (adrenaline: mean VAS score, 4.9 ± 1.3 [n = 1.8 ± 0.8]; TXA: mean VAS score, 5.3 ± 1.4 [n = 1.8 ± 0.8]). Both adrenaline and TXA were more successful in controlling moderate bleeding (86.7% and 88.7%, respectively) than severe bleeding (40% and 58.3%, respectively; P = .008 and P = .012, respectively) and required more applications for severe bleeding (3.0 ± 0 and 2.4 ± 0.5, respectively) than moderate bleeding (1.7 ± 0.8 and 1.7 ± 0.8, respectively) control (P = .006 and P = .002, respectively). We observed no drug-related adverse events in either group. INTERPRETATION: We found no significant difference between adrenaline and TXA for controlling noncatastrophic iatrogenic endobronchial bleeding after cold saline failure, adding to the body of evidence that TXA can be used safely and effectively during FB.

The procedure is safe with a reported mortality between 0% and 0.1% and a complication rate ranging from < 0.1% to 11%. 1-3 The most common complication of diagnostic FB is bleeding, which can occur in 0.26% to 5% of patients, mostly depending on the procedures performed and patient characteristics. 4 The most widely used topical hemostatic agents for bleeding during diagnostic FB are cold saline and adrenaline. The proposed mechanism of action of both drugs is vasoconstriction of pulmonary vessels with consequent blood /uniFB02 ow reduction and hemostasis promotion. 5\nTranexamic acid (TXA) is an anti /uniFB01 brinolytic drug that competitively inhibits the activation of\nplasminogen. Both parenteral and topical TXA are used widely for hemostasis in trauma and various surgical settings after several randomized controlled trials con /uniFB01 rmed their ef /uniFB01 cacy and safety. 6,7 A large retrospective Japanese nationwide study concluded that IV TXA may reduce the mortality, length of hospital stay, and health-care costs of patients with hemoptysis. 8 Furthermore, several small prospective studies investigated the use of TXA in airway bleeding with mostly positive results. TXA was used in a wide range of different forms, from prophylactic intratumoral injection and application via FB for airway bleeding after topical cold saline and adrenaline failure to TXA inhalations for hemoptysis. 9-12 To our knowledge, only one small randomized trial evaluated the role of TXA for bleeding control during FB. A total of 50 patients with hemoptysis or iatrogenic bleeding during diagnostic FB were randomized to either adrenaline or TXA after hemostasis failure of cold saline lavage. Although no signi /uniFB01 cant difference was found in time to bleeding control between the two groups, only one patient in the TXA group vs eight patients in the adrenaline group required additional medication for bleeding control. 13\nBased on these data, we hypothesized that topical TXA is a safe and effective therapy for bleeding management during diagnostic FB. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effectiveness of topical TXA in iatrogenic airway bleeding and compared it with topical adrenaline in a prospective, double-blind, cluster randomized controlled trial.",

Bleeding was stopped successfully with cold saline in 432 patients (75.1%). One patient declined further treatment and was excluded, whereas the remaining 142 patients were randomized to either TXA or adrenaline (75 and 67 patients, respectively). Final analysis was performed in 130 patients; 11 patients were excluded from the /uniFB01 nal analysis because of protocol violations before unblinding and one patient was unblinded during the procedure by the operating bronchoscopist because of the severity of\nbleeding (Fig 1). Patient and procedure characteristics were similar for both groups (Table 1).\nNo signi /uniFB01 cant difference was found in the primary outcome between TXA and adrenaline. Bleeding was stopped successfully in 54 of 65 patients (83.1%) in both groups (Fig 2). Additionally, the sensitivity analysis that was performed because of the disproportionate number of patients excluded from each group showed no signi /uniFB01 cant change in the primary outcome (e-Appendix 2). The severity of bleeding and number of applications needed for bleeding control were similar in both groups (Fig 3). However, more severe bleeding episodes occurred in the TXAgroup(12/65 patients [18.5%]) than in the adrenaline\ngroup (5/65 patients [7.7%]; P ¼ .069). Of the overall 575 bleeding episodes, 367 episodes (63.8%) were scored as mild (VAS score, 1-3), 184 bleeding episodes (32.0%) were scored as moderate (VAS score, 4-6), and 24 bleeding episodes (4.2%) were scored as severe (VAS score, 7 þ ). No signi /uniFB01 cant difference in the bleeding control rate was found between the adrenaline and TXA arms in patients with moderate (VAS score, 4-6; P ¼ .75) and severe (VAS score, 7 þ ; P ¼ .50) bleeding.

Although most bleeding episodes during FB are mild and self-limiting, serious or fatal bleeding can occur even in the absence of obvious precipitating factors. 15,16 We recorded a total of 575 bleeding episodes during the 2,033 FBs performed, most of which were classi /uniFB01 ed as mild (367/575 [63.8%]) and moderate (184/575 [32.0%]) with a mean VAS score of 3.6 /C6 1.3. Of the 2,033 patients, 142 patients (6.98%) required at least one drug application for bleeding control during FB and only 20 patients (0.98%) experienced severe (VAS score, 7 þ ) bleeding. No deaths occurred during the study period, four patients (0.19%) required hospitalization for recurrent bleeding, and only one patient (0.05%) experienced massive bleeding requiring ICU admission. Most moderate and severe bleeding occurred after endobronchial biopsy of visible lesions, followed by TBB, both of which are known to be most associated with clinically signi /uniFB01 cant bleeding. Although the incidence of severe bleeding was similar to the incidence reported in previous studies, 17-19 we observed a higher incidence of mild and moderate bleeding in the present cohort. This could be explained\n]\nby several factors, including patient, procedure, and operator characteristics and bleeding de /uniFB01 nitions, which are not standardized in the literature. 20 A standardized bleeding scale was proposed recently to de /uniFB01 ne bleeding severity after TBB by grading the required response, the Nashville bleeding scale. Using this scale, the vast majority of the current randomized patients would be classi /uniFB01 ed as having grade 2 bleeding. 20 Similarly, the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events that was used to assess bleeding in the NAVIGATE study also is based on the intervention needed to control the bleeding. 19 Despite promising attempts, no methods to quantify bleeding objectively are used widely, and de /uniFB01 nitions of massive bleeding vary in the literature. 5,21 Thus, we decided to use a simple VAS to assess the severity of bleeding from minor (score of 1) to very severe (score of 10). Although subjective, similar subjective assessments of bleeding were used in previous studies and were adapted by the British Thoracic Society guidelines for diagnostic FB. 22,23 The mean VAS score and VAS score distribution were similar in both groups, allowing us to conclude that no signi /uniFB01 cant bias resulting\nfrom perceived bleeding severity was present. The groups also were well balanced regarding other important factors such as procedure type, comorbidities, platelet counts, and coagulation parameters. Furthermore, the physician composition is the same every week in our bronchoscopy unit.\nAlthough bleeding is one of the most common complications of FB, strong recommendations from guidelines on bleeding management are lacking. A narrow selection of topical medications is used in everyday practice with evidence from high-quality trials supporting their use missing. 22 The most used substances are cold saline and adrenaline, but despite their widespread use, no standardization of doses and dilutions used during FB exists. The amount of cold saline recommended by the literature ranges from largevolume iced saline lavage using 50-mL aliquots, with an average volume of up to 500 mL in some series, 24 to small aliquots of 5 to 10 mL. 22 Although the control of bleeding after TBB in the lung periphery may require larger volumes of cold saline, we used 5-mL aliquots\naccording to usual institutional protocol. Although topical therapies usually are considered similar in potency, particularly when grading bleeding, 20 we observed a signi /uniFB01 cant drop in cold saline ef /uniFB01 cacy with increasing bleeding severity. TXA and adrenaline successfully controlled most bleeding that could not be stopped with cold saline, but the additional time and wedging of the bronchoscope likely also contributed. Additionally, despite reports of successful control of massive bleeding with cold saline, 25 only three of 20 episodes of severe bleeding were controlled by cold saline in this study. This difference could be explained by the smaller volume of saline used in our protocol.\nSimilarly, the literature recommends a variety of doses and concentrations of adrenaline (from 0.5 mL up to 20 mL of 1:20,000 solution), with no high-quality data favoring one or the other or supporting the use of adrenaline for endobronchial bleeding in general. 14 We used 2-mL aliquots of 1:10,000 adrenaline according to usual institutional protocol. Adrenaline was effective in bleeding control, stopping 83.1% of bleeding successfully. This success rate was better than we expected based on the study by Fekri et al 13 that reported a success rate of 68%, a difference that could be explained by different doses and dilutions used, study design, and sample size. Adrenaline has the potential of causing arrhythmia and should be used with caution in elderly patients and patients with known heart disease, carcinoid tumors, or a history of arrhythmias. Several existing case reports raise the concern of the safety of adrenaline, even in previously healthy adults with no known risk factors for malignant arrhythmia. 14,26 We observed no SAEs that could be associated de /uniFB01 nitely with adrenaline and no malignant arrhythmias during the study period. However, all patients with uncontrolled cardiovascular comorbidities and arrhythmia were not eligible to undergo bronchoscopy (e-Appendix 1).\nAfter the af /uniFB01 rmation of TXA in different trauma and surgical indications, several small trials explored the role of TXA in the setting of endobronchial bleeding. MárquezMartín et al 12 conducted a pilot study that included patients with both non-iatrogenic and iatrogenic bleeding. TXA was applied after cold saline and adrenaline failure. All patients in the iatrogenic group (n ¼ 20) achieved hemostasis. In the study by Fekri et al, 13 TXAachieved an equally impressive success rate, stopping 24 of 25 bleeding episodes (96%). We observed a 83.1% total success rate of TXAinthisstudyanda100%(11/11episodes)successrate when used after crossover. Although the total success rate was lower, we observed an equally impressive success rate\nafter adrenaline and cold saline failure. This observation is limited by the very small number of patients, but could be a consequence of a synergistic effect of adrenaline and TXA, which have different mechanisms of action. Importantly, in addition to design differences between our and the above-mentioned studies, we used a different dose and dilution of TXA, which also could have contributed to the observed difference in ef /uniFB01 cacy. The most important concern of TXA use, which was emphasized previously in the literature, is the theoretical increased risk of thrombotic complications. 4 We observed no thrombotic events related to the application of TXA in this study.\nAlthough many potential sources of bias are eliminated from our trial because of the double-blind randomized controlled trial design, it has several limitations. First, the single-center design and the use of the investigated drugs in speci /uniFB01 c doses and concentrations after cold saline failure according to usual institutional protocol limit the generalizability of our /uniFB01 ndings. Second, we decided to exclude noniatrogenic bleeding because of concerns for patient safety and inability to provide informed consent for trial participation in emergency situations, thus excluding an important patient group from analysis. Third, we included different bronchoscopic techniques that have different mechanisms for bleeding. TBB, a technique that is associated most commonly with severe bleeding that is dif /uniFB01 cult to manage, was underrepresented in this cohort. Fourth, a much higher proportion of patients randomized to TXA were excluded for protocol violation. Finally, although a placebo-controlled trial would determine the ef /uniFB01 cacy and safety of topical TXA in bleeding during FB better, we used adrenaline as a comparator because it is the standard of care at our institution and not providing it could impact patient safety negatively, despite the lack of high-quality evidence supporting its use. Furthermore, we consider using a placebo for a potentially life-threatening complication to be unethical.",
