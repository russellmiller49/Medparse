      "title": "Introduction",
      "content": "The optimal procedure  for chest tube removal has long been a subject of debate among both surgeons and pulmonologists. 1  Digital drainage devices have contributed  to greater consensus regarding the appropriate timing and conditions for chest tube removal. 1  Unlike analogue drainage devices, digital devices provide an objective and continuous display of current and past air leaks, which has led to a reduction in the use of clamping trials. 2 It has been suggested that when a digital continuous recording drainage device is used and demonstrates the absence of (intermittent)  air leakage, provocative clamping trials may no longer be necessary. 3\nClamping trials continue to be employed  in clinical practice even when digital drainage devices are used. This practice is often driven by expert opinion, entrenched  habits, and concerns over a potential recurrent pneumothorax.  Nonetheless, clamping trials require  additional time, may lead to prolonged patient discomfort, longer hospital stay, and  subsequently  incur increased costs. 4\nThere are no prospective studies  evaluating clamping trials prior to chest tube removal with digital drainage systems. One prospective study assessing analogue drainage systems in patients with traumatic pneumothorax  reported no difference in the rate of recurrent pneumothoraces  between patients who underwent  clamping prior to chest tube removal and those where no preceding intervention  was performed  (10% vs. 4.5%, respectively). 5\nWe hypothesize  that chest tube removal based solely on data derived  from digital drainage systems is an acceptable approach compared to supplementary  clamping trials preceding  chest tube removal in patients treated for pneumothorax  or following lung surgery.",

      "content": "Patients were randomized  on a 1:1 basis and assigned to either the Clamping Group (control) or the No-Clamping Group (intervention).  Groups were stratified according to chest tube indication (non-\nsurgical chest tube placement  for pneumothorax, surgical pleurodesis  for recurrent pneumothorax, or post-pulmonary  resection surgery). A web-based randomization  system (ResearchManager) guaranteed concealment of allocation. Blinding of treatment was not possible due to the nature of the randomized  treatment approaches. Following allocation, all subsequent  treatments in both groups were recorded. Patients in both groups were followed for 30 days after chest tube removal. The Thopaz+ (Medela, Switzerland)  digital chest drainage system was used in all patients.\nBoth treatment groups received standard of care which comprised of daily evaluation of digital chest tube drainage systems during morning rounds, as standard in our hospital. Chest tubes were eligible for removal when airflow was < 20ml/min  and fluid drainage was < 250ml, both over a period of 24 hours. 6\nFor the Clamping Group, once the aforementioned  criteria were met, a baseline chest X-ray was obtained for future comparison and the chest tube was subsequently  clamped. If a recent chest X-ray (obtained within  24 hours prior) was available and displayed  no pneumothorax, the pre-clamping chest X-ray was omitted on the condition the patient had remained clinically stable. A follow-up chest X-ray was performed at least 4 hours after initiating the clamping  trial. Chest tubes were removed if the follow-up chest X-ray showed a stable or no pneumothorax.  In the No-Clamping Group, chest drains were removed immediately  once the criteria for airflow and fluid drainage were fulfilled and a baseline chest X-ray was obtained. The intervention  being the omission of a clamping trial. In both groups, a control chest X-ray was ordered the day following chest tube removal. If the patient was already discharged, this was performed  in an outpatient setting. Chest X-ray was performed earlier if a patient developed  new symptoms indicating possible recurrent  pneumothorax (e.g. pain, dyspnea, hypoxemia).\nChest tubes were removed at end-expiration  in both groups while the patient performed a Valsalva maneuver. 7  The treating physician  was required  to document the procedure  as either uncomplicated, exhibiting a possible air leak during  removal, or showing a definite air leak during removal. In cases of recurrent  pneumothorax  requiring  further intervention,  patients would receive standard of care upon chest tube removal irrespective of their initial original group assignment.",

      "content": "The primary outcome was the percentage of patients who required  chest tube reinsertion  within 24 hours following chest tube removal due to recurrent  ipsilateral pneumothorax. Secondary outcomes included  the total incidence of recurrent ipsilateral pneumothorax  within 24 hours and within 30 days, regardless of the need for intervention,  the duration of chest tube drainage in days, the length of hospitalization following chest tube placement, and number  of ' positive clamping trials ' with progressive pneumothorax  and subsequent  unclamping  of the chest tube. A pneumothorax  after chest tube removal was defined as an increase in the distance between the lung margin and the chest wall at the level of the hilum  of more than 2 centimeter (in accordance with British Thoracic Guidelines 8 ,  or alternatively  an increase in the distance between the lung apex to the cupola of more than 3 centimeter (in accordance with the American  College of Chest Physicians. 9\nSample size and statistical analysis\nThe available literature on this topic is limited. Only one prospective controlled trial exists which used an analogue drainage system in a somewhat dissimilar  population: traumatic pneumothorax.  This study reported no significant difference in the rate of recurrent pneumothorax  necessitating reintervention  between patients after clamping trials or after evaluation of the device alone (10 vs. 4.5%, resp., p-value 0.15 ). 5  Using these results and a web-based sample size calculator with a onesided alpha of 2.5% and a non-inferiority  margin of 10 percentage points, it was determined  that a total of 88 participants  (44 per group) were required  to achieve a power of 80%. 10 In the absence of an established non-inferiority  margin, the study group concluded that a success rate of 90% in the Clamping Group (10% events) compared to an 80% success rate in the No-Clamping Group (20% events) would be deemed  acceptable by both clinicians and patients. This margin reflects a difference that is unlikely to impact clinical decision-making  or patient outcomes, balancing rigor with feasibility.\nA per-protocol analysis with absolute risk differences served as the primary  analysis to assess the outcomes for patients who adhered  strictly to their assigned groups. In addition, an as-treated analysis including  cross-overs, and an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, which included  all randomized patients based on their original group allocation, were conducted. Absolute risk differences for the primary outcome were calculated for each analysis to provide a comprehensive  understanding  of the results. Non-inferiority was concluded  if the upper bound of the two-sided 95% confidence interval for the absolute risk difference between the experimental  and control treatments was less than the non-inferiority  margin. Categorical data were presented  as n(%) and continuous data as mean(±sd)  or median(range),  depending  on the distribution.  Statistical comparisons were made using the independent  samples T-test for normally distributed  data and the Mann-Whitney  U test for nonnormally distributed  data. For paired non-normally distributed  data a Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test was employed. All statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS Statistics version 25.0.",

The total number  of patients with pneumothoraces  irrespective  of the need for reintervention  within 30 days was three in the Clamping Group (6.8%), and two in the No-Clamping Group (5.3%) (risk difference, -1.6 percentage points; 95%CI, % -11.8 - 8.7) (Supplemental  Table 1).\nIn 6 (13.6%) patients in the Clamping Group, the initial clamping trial was unsuccessful,  with progressive pneumothorax  during clamping of the chest tube, necessitating unclamping  and resumption  of chest tube drainage. All six patients with a positive clamping trial had repeated clamping trials in the following days as determined  by the treating physician, after which the chest tubes were removed without a recurrent  ipsilateral pneumothorax.  In one of these patients the chest-tube was removed despite a positive clamping trial, a recurrent  ipsilateral pneumothorax  did not occur.\nIn the ITT analysis one additional pneumothorax  requiring  intervention  within 24 hours occurred in the No-Clamping Group after complicated chest tube removal, resulting in a risk difference of 4.3 percentage points (95%CI, -1.5 -10.0), and was therefore inconclusive  regarding the primary outcome. The total number  of patients with pneumothoraces,  irrespective of the need for reintervention  within 24 hours, was three in the Clamping Group (6.7%), and three in the NoClamping Group (6.4%) (risk difference, -0.3 percentage points; 95%CI, -10.4 to 9.8) (Supplemental Table 2 and Supplemental  Figure 2).  An as-treated analysis, allowing for cross-over of patients, yielded similar findings regarding non-inferiority  as in the primary  per-protocol analysis for pneumothorax  within 24 hours or 30 days (Supplemental  Table 3, Supplemental  Figure 3). The four cross-overs included: one patient assigned to the Clamping Group, where the treating physician omitted the clamping trial due to fluid production  as the only reason for prolonged chest tube drainage; and three patients in the No-Clamping Group, where the treating physician considered  a clamping trial necessary (in two cases due to persistent  low-flow air leaks, and in one case due to\nincomplete lung expansion).  None of these four patients developed  a pneumothorax after chest tube removal. One patient, for whom a clamping trial was performed despite a persistent  low-flow air leak, had a positive clamping trial, as expected. This patient, who had a primary  pneumothorax, subsequently  underwent  surgical pleurectomy  and bullectomy. Following the procedure, the chest tube was removed without a clamping trial, and no recurrent  pneumothorax  was observed during follow-up.\nThe chest tube remained  in situ for a median of three (1-21) days in the No-Clamping Group and three (1-32) days in the Clamping Group (P=0.567). The median length of hospitalization following chest tube placement was four (1-35) days in the No-Clamping Group and five (1-35) days in the Clamping Group (P=0.751). Three patients (7.7%) in the No-Clamping Group and five patients (11.4%) in the Clamping Group were managed with a chest tube (at least in part) in an outpatient setting.\nThe median pneumothorax  size, as measured  from the apex in millimeters,  was 7 (0 -61) before and 8 (0 -62)  after chest tube removal in the Clamping Group (P = 0.123). In the No-Clamping Group, the median pneumothorax  size was 7 (0 -55) before and 9 (0 -55) after chest tube removal (P = 0.610). The change in pneumothorax  size did not alter between the No-Clamping Group and Clamping Group (P=0.117)  (Supplemental  Table 4).",

      "title": "Discussion",
      "content": "This study aimed to evaluate the safety of chest tube removal without clamping trials in patients treated for post-lung surgery or pneumothorax, utilizing digital drainage systems. Our results  indicate that the omission of clamping trials is not inferior to the traditional clamping method in preventing recurrent  pneumothorax  requiring  chest tube reinsertion,  thereby supporting  the hypothesis  that data from digital drainage systems alone can safely guide chest tube removal.\nThe length of hospital stay and the time to chest tube removal did not differ significantly between the groups and can therefore not be used as additional arguments  for waiving clamping trials. Lung collapse following clamping, with subsequent  unclamping  of the chest tube, occurred in a clinically significant proportion of patients (13.3%), whereas no similar instances of pneumothoraces  were observed in the No-Clamping Group. This finding suggests that clamping trials may have a potentially provocative effect and underscore the potential challenges, as unsuccessful  attempts may result in prolonged chest tube use and patient discomfort in this subgroup.\nOne prospective study 5 and three retrospective studies 11-13 have previously  evaluated the utility of clamping trials. None of these studies  utilized digital drainage devices, and the patient populations varied from traumatic to spontaneous pneumothoraces.  Consistent with our findings, three out of four studies  reported no significant difference in the rates of recurrent pneumothorax  between patients who underwent  clamping (5.9-10%) and those who did not (4.5-7.4%) before chest tube removal.  5,9,11 Interestingly, these studies also reported  lower rates of recurrent pneumothorax  after chest tube removal without clamping trials than would be expected based on the number  of progressive pneumothoraces  during clamping trials in the clamping groups (9.7-11.7%). In contrast, one retrospective study involving trauma patients found fewer pleural drainage procedures  within 30 days of follow-up when clamping was performed  prior to chest tube removal (13(6%)  vs. 33 (12%)). 12 The  results of the retrospective studies must be interpreted  with caution because significant bias due to patient selection cannot be excluded.\nOur results might have significant implications for clinical practice. The traditional use of clamping trials is rooted in a conservative approach to avoid recurrent  pneumothorax. However, this study shows that reliance on digital drainage system data eliminates the need for clamping trials, thereby streamlining  the workflow and number  of imaging studies. The unexpectedly  high need to unclamp chest tubes in 13.6% of patients emphasizes  the importance of a cautious approach to clamping trials, as they may result in delayed chest tube removal and increased patient discomfort. While we can only speculate, we propose that the provocative effects observed during clamping may be due to a 'false air leak', where increased negative intrapleural  pressure  during normal breathing draws air from the chest tube incision or system, despite appropriate  dressings. Alternatively, while a slow air leak is considered, its clamping-specific occurrence makes this less likely.\nPatients recovering from surgical pleurodesis  for pneumothorax  may need a different strategy. Since pleurodesis  takes at least several days to develop 14 , any pneumothorax, either due to chest removal or clamping, in this early adhesing period  could theoretically compromise the effectiveness of this invasive procedure. Our subgroups  were too small for separate analysis of patients after surgical pleurodesis.  However, an alternative approach such as obligatory chest tube drainage for a yet to determine  post-operative period might mitigate the risk of chest tube removal procedures.\nSeveral limitations  must be acknowledged. The single-center design of the study may limit generalizability.  The selection of a 10% non-inferiority margin reflects an acceptable clinical threshold informed by prior studies  and expert consensus, but was not directly validated through patient consultation. The smaller observed difference (only 1 event in the No-Clamping Group versus 0 in the Clamping Group, which represented  a 2.6 percentage points difference for the primary outcome) suggests that the study may have been conservatively powered. Although the results support noninferiority, future studies with larger sample sizes may ensure sufficient power to do subgroup analyses and detect rare adverse events, these should incorporate patient engagement to ensure clinically meaningful  thresholds that reflect both professional and patient priorities. The predominance  of post-lung resection cases in the study limits its applicability  to non-surgical pneumothorax  patients. While stratifying by chest tube indication reduces some variability, further research targeting distinct etiological groups is necessary to validate these results across different patient populations, such as post-chemical pleurodesis, which was not studied here. While digital drainage systems demonstrate  clear clinical advantages, the question of cost-effectiveness warrants consideration, particularly given the significant upfront investment  associated with these systems. Additionally,  some protocol deviations occurred, with four patients undergoing  procedures contrary to their initial allocation. Subgroup  analysis of these deviations revealed no discernible  impact on pneumothorax  recurrences  rates, suggesting that the deviations did not significantly influence the study 's  conclusions.\nIn conclusion, this study provides additional evidence that chest tube removal based solely on digital drainage system data, without clamping trials, is as safe as the traditional method with clamping. This approach not only maintains patient safety but also has the potential to enhance patient comfort and reduce the number  of imaging studies.",
