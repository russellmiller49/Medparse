The gold standard therapy for PAP is whole lung lavage (WLL). Few studies have reported the optimal technique with which to evaluate the response to WLL. In this study, we aimed to identify parameters with which to assess the need for repeat WLL during a long-term 8-year follow-up. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 120 patients with autoimmune PAP with 80 of whom underwent WLL. Physiologic, serologic, and radiologic features of the patients were analyzed during an 8-year follow-up after the first WLL treatment.\nResults: Of the 40 patients without any intervention, 39 patients either achieved remission or remained stable and only one died of pulmonary infection. Of the 56 patients who underwent WLL for 1 time, 55 remained free from a second WLL and 1 patient died of cancer. Twenty-four required additional treatments after their first WLL. The baseline PaO 2 ( P = 0.000), P A-aO 2 ( P = 0.000), shunt fraction rate ( P = 0.001), percent of predicted normal diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO%Pred) ( P = 0.016), 6-min walk test ( P = 0.013), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) ( P = 0.007), and neuron-specific enolase (NSE) ( P = 0.003) showed significant differences among the three groups. The need for a second WLL was significantly associated with PaO 2 ( P =  0.000), CEA ( P =  0.050) ,  the  6-minute walk test ( P =  0.026), and DLCO%Pred ( P =  0.041). The DLCO%Pred on admission with a cut-off value of 42.1% ( P = 0.001) may help to distinguish whether patients with P AP require a second WLL. Conclusions: WLL is the optimal treatment method for PAP and provides remarkable improvements for affected patients. The DLCO%Pred on admission with a cut-off value of 42.1% may distinguish whether patients with PAP require a second WLL.\nKey words: Diffusing Capacity of the Lung for Carbon Monoxide; Prognosis; Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis; Treatment; Whole Lung Lavage",

[1] Since then, increasing numbers of reports on PAP have been published; however, only a few studies have evaluated  Asian populations [6,8] and the response to WLL treatment with a long-term follow-up. In this study, we retrospectively reviewed 120 Chinese adults with autoimmune PAP, 80 of whom underwent WLL.\nP value was calculated by comparing the baseline parameters among the three groups according to the WLL times; *Range.

The mean age at diagnosis in our study was 43 years. However, in the studies of Asian populations from Japan [6] and Korea, [8]   the mean age was older at 51 and 52 years, respectively. A low proportion of our cohort constituted smokers (48%), while the proportion of smokers in a Germany cohort (79%) was nearly 2 times higher than this.  Spontaneous remission occurred in 9% of  patients  ( n =  11)  in  this  study,  which  is  lower  than that (13%) in a Korean study. [8] Only 2 patients died in our cohort, representing the lowest percentage of 2%. Because the morbidity rate was low, we did not analyze the overall survival rate.\nComparison of the results before and after WLL shows that patients experienced objective improvements after WLL. The results of the arterial blood gas analysis are corroborated by the data in a Korean [8] and Italian study. [13] The improvement of  all  parameters  in  the  pulmonary  function  tests  except TLC%Pred is also in agreement with the results of the above mentioned Korean [8] and Italian studies. [13] The results of the 6-min walk test support the increase in the treadmill distance in  the  Italian  study. [13] Considering  that  we  reexamined the results about 4-6 weeks after the first WLL, not only were the materials in the alveolar spaces removed, but the engorgement of the lymphatic vessels within the interlobular septae was almost completely relieved, which is the basis for the improvement in the test results described above. [13] Multiple WLL treatments were conducted in 24 (30%) of the 80 patients, which is similar to the frequency reported in the Italian study. [9]\nAlthough WLL has been performed in many centers for almost 50 years, [14]  no consensus on how to best evaluate\nthe effectiveness of WLL has been established. In practice, many physicians evaluate the indications for treatment and establish the management strategy intuitively. In the present study, a 42.1% cut-off value for DLCO%Pred might help to distinguish patients who require a second WLL and possibly allow for early prognostic assessment of the responsiveness of PAP to WLL. Large quantities of surfactant lipids and proteins  accumulate in the alveolar spaces, leading to a decrease in the alveolar capillary membrane surface area, an increase in the diffusion path length, and ventilation perfusion mismatch, which are the main reasons for the disproportionate reduction of DLCO%Pred in patients with PAP. [15]  Consequently, DLCO%Pred is well correlated with the severity of PAP. When combined with other parameters, DLCO%Pred failed to reach statistical difference in our study,  which  might  have  been  caused  by  the  potential correlation between DLCO%Pred and PaO 2 , CEA, and NSE. However, DLCO%Pred is still associated with the need for lavage, as reported in the above mentioned study from Italy [9] and another from Germany. [16]  Although the serum KL-6 level seems to predict the outcome of PAP, [16]  measurement of the serum KL-6 level is not widely used as a routine test in most hospitals in China. In contrast, nearly all hospitals can routinely conduct pulmonary function tests at reasonable cost; thus, DLCO%Pred may provide higher practicability.\nDuring the 8.6-year  follow-up  period  of  this  study,  no patients in the multiple WLL group died; however, all of these patients required additional WLLs or other methods to relieve symptoms. Two patients (one female [17] and one male) exhibited a good initial response to WLL. However, multiple sessions of WLL were subsequently required. These patients then underwent several sessions of plasmapheresis with very little improvement. Finally, supplementation with inhaled and subcutaneously injected GM-CSF was performed. The patients were in stable condition at the end of the follow-up period.\nAs reported, up to 10% of patients are resistant to WLL, and this treatment is associated with various complications, including hypoxemia, hydropneumothorax, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and infections. However, various modern techniques are being applied to increase the effectiveness and safety, and the percentage of complications is decreasing. [18] Other approaches or combined therapy is recommended for patients who develop recurrence after WLL or cannot accept the risks and potential complications of an invasive procedure. [10]   GM-CSF  followed  by  WLL  could  be attempted; the response rate to this combination in one study varied from 43% to 92%, and the relapse rate in GM-CSF responders was 29.7%. [19] Inhaled GM-CSF was effective in 62-92% of patients with few complications such as fever or upper respiratory infection. [20,21] In contrast, subcutaneously administered GM-CSF was effective in 43-75% of patients in  other  studies. [22-24] However,  local  reactions  at  the injection sites and other minor toxicities occurred in 85% of patients, [5] and 45% of patients required additional WLL. [24] Consequently, with the better responsiveness and tolerance, inhaled GM-CSF is more highly recommended. [19]  If there\nis an inadequate response to GM-CSF or unacceptable side effects,  rituximab  or  plasmapheresis  can  be  attempted. Rituximab has a high response rate ranging from 78% to 100% and is associated with minor adverse reactions such as fatigue, nausea, and nasal congestion. [25-27] Plasmapheresis removes circulating antibodies with Gram-negative sepsis as a complication. [23,28,29]  However, the approaches mentioned above are not yet validated for routine use.  Systematic evaluation and standard principles should be conducted in future research.\nOur study was limited by its retrospective nature. First, not all data were collected from the patients' clinical notes, affecting the  quality  in  some  cases.  Second,  we  could  not  test  and monitor the GM-CSF autoantibody levels. Finally, the number of patients enrolled was limited because of the single-center nature of the study. Given the rarity of autoimmune PAP, we collected a remarkable number of samples to clarify the epidemiology, clinical features, and prognosis in Chinese patients and shared our experience with WLL to promote the development of a better management strategy.\nIn conclusion, the prognosis of patients with PAP is relatively good. Some patients achieve remission and remain stable without any intervention. WLL is the optimal treatment method and provides remarkable improvements. The need for a second WLL is significantly associated with CEA, NSE, the 6-min walk test, and DLCO%Pred. The DLCO%Pred on admission with a cut-off value of 42.1% may distinguish patients  with  PAP,  who  require  multiple  WLL,  which provides a promising approach for clinicians in evaluating the responsiveness to WLL in patients with PAP.",
