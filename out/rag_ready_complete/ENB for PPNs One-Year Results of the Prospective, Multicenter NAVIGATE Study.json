    "abstract": "Introduction: Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) is a minimally invasive technology that guides endoscopic tools to pulmonary lesions. ENB has been evaluated primarily in small, single-center studies; thus, the diagnostic yield in a generalizable setting is unknown. Methods: NAVIGATE is a prospective, multicenter, cohort study that evaluated ENB using the superDimension navigation system (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota). In this United States cohort analysis, 1215 consecutive subjects were enrolled at 29 academic and community sites from April 2015 to August 2016. Results: The median lesion size was 20.0 mm. Fluoroscopy was used in 91% of cases (lesions visible in 60%) and radial endobronchial ultrasound in 57%. The median ENB planning time was 5 minutes; the ENB-speci /uniFB01 c procedure time was 25 minutes. Among 1157 subjects undergoing ENBguided biopsy, 94% (1092 of 1157) had navigation completed and tissue obtained. Follow-up was completed in 99% of subjects at 1 month and 80% at 12 months. The 12month diagnostic yield was 73%. Pathology results of the ENB-aided tissue samples showed malignancy in 44% (484 of 1092). Sensitivity, speci /uniFB01 city, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for malignancy were 69%, 100%, 100%, and 56%, respectively. ENB-related Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 2 or higher pneumothoraces (requiring admission or chest tube placement) occurred in 2.9%. The ENB-related Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 2 or higher bronchopulmonary hemorrhage and grade 4 or higher respiratory failure rates were 1.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Conclusions: NAVIGATE shows that an ENB-aided diagnosis can be obtained in approximately three-quarters of evaluable patients across a generalizable cohort based on prospective 12-month follow-up in a pragmatic setting with a low procedural complication rate. /C211 2018 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.

      "content": "Guidelines recommend the least invasive method possible for the evaluation of suspicious lung nodules based on the pre-test probability of malignancy. 1 Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) is recommended for peripheral lesions dif /uniFB01 cult to reach with conventional bronchoscopy alone. 2 However, as with all diagnostic modalities, the diagnostic yield, sensitivity, and negative predictive value (NPV) of ENB must be established to achieve suf /uniFB01 cient con /uniFB01 dence in a nonmalignant result and guide further evaluation based on patient comorbidities and cancer risk.\nMore than 100 ENB studies have been published (Supplemental Data 1); however, most were retrospective, single-center, and conducted by expert users. Furthermore, long-term follow-up of initially negative or indeterminate diagnoses is often incomplete. Thus, the generalizability of diagnostic yield data in the ENB literature is unknown.\nNAVIGATE is a large, multicenter cohort study that prospectively evaluated the diagnostic yield of ENB with rigorous follow-up to ensure that negative or indeterminate results are truly negative. 3 One-month safety and usage patterns of the /uniFB01 rst 1000 subjects enrolled have been published. 4 The current analysis of the full United States cohort is the /uniFB01 rst opportunity to assess ENB diagnostic yield across diverse settings in a real-world, patient-centered design. This 12-month analysis has broad and immediate applicability given the current challenges in the management of nodules detected incidentally and through low-dose computed tomography (CT) screening.",

      "content": "NAVIGATE is a prospective, multicenter, global, single-arm, pragmatic cohort study of ENB using the superDimension navigation system, version\n6.0 or higher (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota). 5 Consecutive adult subjects presenting with a lung lesion requiring evaluation and who were candidates for an elective ENB procedure according to physician judgment were enrolled. There were no protocolspeci /uniFB01 ed restrictions on procedural technique, complementary tools, or imaging (planning or surveillance); these were subject to the clinician ' s discretion, but were prospectively captured. Biopsy tools used by the NAVIGATE investigators were aspirating needles, biopsy forceps, cytology brushes, needle-tipped cytology brushes, the superDimension triple-needle cytology brush (Medtronic), the GenCut core biopsy system (Medtronic), and bronchoalveolar lavage (considered a tool for the purposes of this analysis). 4 Lymph node staging by linear endobronchial ultrasound (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)) could occur before, during, or after the index procedure at physician discretion. Any patients initially considered for ENB who obtained a diagnosis by linear Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) that precluded the need for ENB evaluation of a lung lesion were not enrolled. A maximum of 75 subjects per site was allowed to ensure diversity. Source-data veri /uniFB01 cation was conducted in 25% of subjects using risk-based monitoring. Twenty-four -month follow-up was pre-speci /uniFB01 ed at all sites. The study is registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02410837) and the full study design has been published. 3\nIn the overall study, subjects were enrolled at 37 sites in the United States and Europe. The focus herein is on the 12-month follow-up of the United States cohort. Twelve-month follow-up in Europe is ongoing.\nThe primary endpoint was ENB-related pneumothorax requiring intervention or hospitalization, which was chosen as a safety endpoint applicable to ENBguided lung lesion biopsy, /uniFB01 ducial placement, or dye marking. Safety endpoints were de /uniFB01 ned according to the validated Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events scale (CTCAE) and adjudicated by an independent medical monitor. 3\nFor the purposes of this 12-month analysis, pathology results of ENB-aided biopsy samples that were diagnostic of a nonmalignant condition or indeterminate were referred to as negative for malignancy or negative, for brevity. Follow-up was then conducted to determine the true diagnosis (malignant or nonmalignant). All cases were followed according to the practitioner ' s judgment (e.g., surgical tissue biopsy, repeat ENB, CT-guided transthoracic needle biopsy or aspiration [TTNA], serial CT imaging, and lung health visits). Cases with subsequent diagnostic tests con /uniFB01 rming a nonmalignant diagnosis or without lesion progression on radiographic follow-up were considered true-negative as of 12\nmonths, consistent with prior ENB studies (Supplemental Data 2). If the follow-up diagnostics revealed malignancy or if lesion growth was observed on repeat imaging with appropriate follow-up diagnostic testing, this was considered a false-negative. The following were also considered false-negative: death due to lung cancer within 12 months; treatment without a con /uniFB01 rmed diagnosis; and new diagnoses of cancer in the lung from any site (including non-index lesions, or lymph nodes diagnosed as malignant by linear Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) during or after the index procedure).\nTwelve-month diagnostic yield was calculated per subject as the rate of true-positives (for malignancy) plus true negatives (for malignancy) of all subjects with attempted lung lesion biopsies. Negative cases with insuf /uniFB01 cient information to evaluate 12-month diagnostic yield were deferred for analysis at 24 months. These cases were included in a sensitivity analysis, assuming all were false-negative and then true-negative, to provide low and high estimates of 12-month diagnostic yield, sensitivity, and NPV. All subjects will be followed through 24 months in accordance with guideline recommendations. 6\nAnalyses were performed using SAS Version 9.4 (SAS Inc., Cary, North Carolina). Data are summarized by descriptive statistics, including frequency distributions and cross-tabulations for discrete variables and mean, standard deviation, median, interquartile range, minimum, and maximum values for continuous variables. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were conducted to determine predictors of 12-month diagnostic yield. After selecting candidate variables, multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted using stepwise selection procedures with an entry signi /uniFB01 cance level of 0.20 and an exit signi /uniFB01 cance level of 0.05.",

Negative cases were evaluated according to clinical and radiologic follow-up using a predetermined hierarchy of certainty. As of 12 months, 284 initially negative outcomes were\nconsidered true-negative and 220 were false-negative. The physician-estimated pretest probability of malignancy was 81.8% in true-positives, 70.4% in falsenegatives, and 47.8% in true-negatives.\nThe 12-month diagnostic yield was 72.9% (Table 2), calculated as true-positives (for malignancy) plus truenegatives (for malignancy) (numerator ¬º 484 √æ 284) (Fig. 4) of all attempted biopsy cases excluding the deferred cases (denominator ¬º 1157 -104).

Sensitivity for malignancy and NPV were 68.8% (range: 59.9% -68.8%) and 56.3% (range: 46.7% -63.8%), respectively (Table 2). All positive and negative results will be re-evaluated at 24 months.\nMultivariate predictors of diagnostic yield are shown in Figure 5. A personal history of cancer was a signi /uniFB01 cant multivariate predictor of lower diagnostic yield. Use of less than three biopsy tools, lymph node sampling during the ENB procedure, presence of a\nbronchus sign, biopsy of multiple lesions, and procedure time less than 60 minutes were signi /uniFB01 cant multivariate predictors of higher diagnostic yield. Unadjusted for other factors, diagnostic yield was 70.6% in cases using rEBUS and 76.4% without rEBUS (univariate p ¬º 0.04); however, the multivariate effect was not statistically signi /uniFB01 cant. ROSE use (78.6%, versus 75.8% without ROSE), lesion size 20 mm or greater (77.6%, versus 67.3% for lesions less than 20 mm), and upper lobe location (76.5%, versus 67.9% for middle/lower) were not signi /uniFB01 cant multivariate predictors of diagnostic yield. Lesion size 20 mm or greater and upper-lobe location were signi /uniFB01 -cant univariate factors (Supplemental Data 5).\nIn the 423 subjects diagnosed with primary lung cancer, the clinical stage as reported by the investigator after the ENB procedure (and any contemporaneous Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided staging) was 54.1% stage I, 11.1% stage II, 17.0% stage III, and 17.7% stage IV.",

Of note, NAVIGATE cases with unsuccessful navigation were included in the diagnostic yield denominator. This is aligned with the purpose of ENB as a navigation tool and provides a more conservative estimate. Excluding unsuccessful navigation cases would have resulted in a diagnostic yield of 77.7% (low -high estimates: 70.3% -79.9%).\nTTNA diagnostic accuracy ranges from 75% to 97%, with a published meta-analysis rate of 92%. 10 However, few TTNA studies report the long-term follow-up of negative results. In one analysis, half of all negative TTNA specimens were false-negative (51% NPV for malignancy). 11 In contrast to NAVIGATE ' s consecutive enrollment, most TTNA studies also exclude patients at high risk for complications (i.e., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)]) or with lesions not reachable percutaneously. TTNA has been associated with pooled pneumothorax rates of 19% to 25%, 10,12 which could be even higher when accounting for immediate aspiration of periprocedural pneumothoraces. 13 The pneumothorax risk in NAVIGATE was low (4.3% overall and 2.9% requiring hospitalization or intervention) and was not increased in subjects with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or poor pulmonary function. 14 With 25% of lesions on the pleura and similar diagnostic yield regardless of the distance from the pleura (Supplemental Data 5 B ), NAVIGATE suggests that lesions traditionally evaluated with percutaneous biopsy can safely undergo ENB with mediastinal staging in the same anesthetic episode.",

      "content": "At 12 months, 284 NAVIGATE cases were considered true-negative. Initially negative results were reevaluated at 12 months based on pre-speci /uniFB01 ed criteria (Fig. 4) aligned with guidelines. 1,6 Whereas some were con /uniFB01 rmed by surgical tissue biopsy, repeat ENB, or TTNA, most were followed with serial CT imaging. Those with lesion resolution or stability are assumed to be true-negative for malignancy as of 12 months. Assumptions made in everyday practice must be categorized within a clinical study to readily compare across data sets. Although true-negatives represent the largest area of uncertainty at 12 months, they provide insight into real-life scenarios in patient management that physicians face every day. To truly measure the accuracy of any diagnostic procedure for lung nodules would require surgical resection and biopsy following every negative result. However, that approach would expose patients to unnecessary risk. Guidelines recommend surgical biopsy when the pretest probability is greater than 65%. 1 NAVIGATE true-negative cases followed radiologically had an average pretest probability of only 47%. NAVIGATE suggests that many practitioners use a watch-andwait approach for lesions with a low/moderate malignancy risk. As a minimally invasive option for both diagnosis and staging, ENB may draw a higher proportion of intermediate-risk nodules, in keeping with published guidelines. 1 The 12-month prevalence of malignancy in NAVIGATE is 67%, similar to 76.5% (range: 57% -92%) reported in one ENB meta-analysis. 9 Thus, although ENB has a NPV of only 56% it provides a low-risk option for concurrent diagnostic testing, EBUSguided staging, and localization (by /uniFB01 ducial markers or\nDistance from Lesion to Pleura (mm)\npleural dye) of intermediate-risk nodules, which may be particularly advantageous in patients with poor pulmonary function. 14\nThere were 101 (9.6%) pathology reports of normal lung tissue in NAVIGATE, including 42 categorized as false-negative and 40 as true-negative. The remaining 19 cases were deferred and included in the low/high estimate scenarios. Six of 40 normal lung tissue cases considered true-negatives were diagnosed by surgical tissue biopsy, repeat ENB, or TTNA; the rest were followed by serial CT without evidence of lesion progression (31 cases) or of /uniFB01 ce visits in which the provider reported no change in diagnosis (3 cases). Although inaccurate ENB-guided localization could explain some normal lung tissue /uniFB01 ndings, nodule resolution between the initial CT and the ENB procedure may also have occurred. In prior studies, 7% to 10% of nodules decreased in size or resolved compared to initial CT /uniFB01 ndings. 15,16",

It is acknowledged that not all true-negatives can currently be considered a /uniFB01 nal diagnosis.\nNAVIGATE is the /uniFB01 rst large, multicenter study to follow negative results over time within the continuum of patient care. As in most prior ENB studies, the diagnostic yield calculation in NAVIGATE includes truepositives and true-negatives (Supplemental Data 2). A large multicenter ENB registry reported diagnostic yields of 38.5% for ENB alone and 47.1% for ENB √æ rEBUS. 17 However, follow-up was limited to 4 of 15 centers, and true-negatives based on radiographic follow-up were excluded from the diagnostic yield numerator. In the follow-up subset, the sensitivity of ENB for malignancy was estimated at 54% to 69%, similar to the NAVIGATE sensitivity estimates (60% -69%). 17\nAll negative results will be evaluated over 24 months in accordance with accepted guidelines, 6 thus re /uniFB02 ecting what practitioners face daily in their practice.

Multivariate predictors of increased diagnostic yield were procedure time less than 60 minutes, use of fewer than three biopsy tools, lymph node sampling, biopsy of multiple lesions, and presence of a bronchus sign.\nThe effect of tool use and procedure time may be intuitively explained by more complex cases in those situations requiring more time and more tools to achieve desired results. Similarly, intuition would suggest that lymph node sampling and biopsy of multiple lesions during ENB may provide additive information to assist pathologists in making a diagnostic call. Further research is required to tease out these multifactorial effects.\nThe absence of a bronchus sign has been associated with lower diagnostic yield in prior ENB and rEBUS studies, with ENB diagnostic yields of 31% to 44% without a bronchus sign. 18-20 The diagnostic yield of 67% in non -bronchus-sign NAVIGATE cases may re /uniFB02 ect improved software, user training, experience, and tool availability in more recent years.\nSurprisingly, the NAVIGATE diagnostic yield was higher without rEBUS use (76.4%) than with rEBUS use (70.6%), although the multivariate effect was not statistically signi /uniFB01 cant. In a randomized trial, diagnostic yield was signi /uniFB01 cantly higher with ENB √æ rEBUS (87.5%) than with ENB alone (59.0%). 21 Balancing lesion complexity between groups in a randomized setting eliminates the effect of patient selection. rEBUS may be used selectively for the most challenging cases, or when accurate ENB localization is uncertain.

Although 448 of those were guided by linear Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), bronchoscopy allows ENB-guided lung lesion biopsy and staging in the same anesthetic event, in contrast to transthoracic methods. Of the NAVIGATE subjects diagnosed with lung cancer, 65% were at stage\nI-II at the time of the ENB index procedure. The ability to diagnose early and stage in a single procedure may improve survival and reduce treatment costs. 23,24 Furthermore, the overall procedure time in this study was less than an hour, including 25 minutes of ENBspeci /uniFB01 c navigation and biopsy time.\nTissue adequacy for molecular testing was 86% in NAVIGATE. A meta-analysis of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided transbronchial needle aspiration reported a 95% adequacy rate. 25 The molecular testing failure rate of percutaneous transthoracic core-needle biopsies was reported at 32% for EGFR, compared to 11% for transbronchial biopsies. 26 Molecular testing was attempted in only 58% of NAVIGATE stage IIIB/stage IV cases. Although current guidelines recommend molecular testing for all latestage Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the NAVIGATE results re /uniFB02 ect guidelines and practice patterns during study enrollment (2015 -2016). 27 With frequent guideline updates, the number of actionable genomic alterations has now more than doubled. 27 In a 15-center study of 814 stage IIIB/IV patients (2013 -2015), only 58% underwent guidelinerecommended EGFR and ALK testing. 28 Molecular testing in NAVIGATE may have been underestimated if conducted on a different sample or if tissue was sent to an external oncologist and not reported to the NAVIGATE clinical site. Lack of reimbursement may also reduce molecular testing rates, particularly at community centers. With continuing discussions regarding the value of broad-based genomic analysis and routine testing of early-stage cancers, these observations will need to be tested in future studies. 29",
