    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Malignant pleural effusion affects more than 750,000 persons each year across Europe and the United States. Pleurodesis with the administration of talc in hospitalized patients is the most common treatment, but indwelling pleural catheters placed for drainage offer an ambulatory alternative. We examined whether talc administered through an indwelling pleural catheter was more effective at inducing pleurodesis than the use of an indwelling pleural catheter alone.\nMETHODS Over a period of 4 years, we recruited patients with malignant pleural effusion at 18 centers in the United Kingdom. After the insertion of an indwelling pleural catheter, patients underwent drainage regularly on an outpatient basis. If there was no evidence of substantial lung entrapment (nonexpandable lung, in which lung expansion and pleural apposition are not possible because of visceral fibrosis or bronchial obstruction) at 10 days, patients were randomly assigned to receive either 4 g of talc slurry or placebo through the indwelling pleural catheter on an outpatient basis. Talc or placebo was administered on a single-blind basis. Follow-up lasted for 70 days. The primary outcome was successful pleurodesis at day 35 after randomization.\nRESULTS The target of 154 patients undergoing randomization was reached after 584 patients were approached. At day 35, a total of 30 of 69 patients (43%) in the talc group had successful pleurodesis, as compared with 16 of 70 (23%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 2.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.23 to 3.92; P=0.008). No significant between-group differences in effusion size and complexity, number of inpatient days, mortality, or number of adverse events were identified. No significant excess of blockages of the indwelling pleural catheter was noted in the talc group.\nCONCLUSIONS Among patients without substantial lung entrapment, the outpatient administration of talc through an indwelling pleural catheter for the treatment of malignant pleural effusion resulted in a significantly higher chance of pleurodesis at 35 days than an indwelling catheter alone, with no deleterious effects.

      "content": "M alignant pleural effusion is estimated  to  affect  more  than  750,000 persons each year across Europe and the United States. 1 Malignant pleural effusion is usually  the  result  of  the  spread  of  metastatic cancer and commonly leads to debilitating symptoms and to multiple interventions as fluid recurs. 2\nHistorically,  the  preferred  approach  in  the treatment of malignant pleural effusion has involved inducing pleurodesis, 2,3 with recent data from  a  meta-analysis  confirming  that  talc  is likely to be the most efficacious agent for this process. 4  The primary disadvantage of chemical pleurodesis is that it usually involves an inpatient stay of 4 to 7 days that, 5,6 in patients receiving palliative treatment for malignant pleural effusion, may represent a substantial proportion of a patient's remaining life. 7\nIndwelling pleural catheters offer an ambulatory alternative for fluid management and are now routinely inserted as day-case procedures (i.e., with the intervention and discharge occurring on the same day). Used in isolation, these catheters  have  been  shown  to  be  as  good  as traditional approaches in managing symptoms in  patients, 5 but  they  do  not  confer  the  same likelihood of pleurodesis, although pleurodesis has been reported to happen spontaneously at rates as disparate as 16% and 65% among patients with malignant pleural effusion. 8,9\nIn a noncomparative series involving 22 patients,  the  administration  of  talc  through  an indwelling pleural catheter suggested that high rates  of  pleurodesis  were  achievable. 10 In  the present  trial,  we  tested  the  hypothesis  that  a combination of talc and indwelling pleural catheter would enhance the probability of successful pleurodesis, as compared with the use of an indwelling pleural catheter alone.",

Potential participants were identified and screened at local centers offering routine pleural services. Patients were eligible if they had a confirmed diagnosis of symptomatic malignant pleural effusion for which the patient had elected treatment with an indwelling pleural catheter. In addition, participants had to have an expected survival of more than 2 months (as judged by a local investigator) and an expected Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance-status score of 2 or less (on a scale from 0 to 4, with higher scores indicating greater disability) after fluid removal. Key exclusion criteria were an age younger than 18 years, extensive lung entrapment (nonexpandable lung, in which lung expansion and pleural apposition  are  not  possible  because  of  visceral fibrosis or bronchial obstruction) or fluid loculation, ipsilateral attempt at pleurodesis within the previous 8 weeks, and any contraindication to the trial procedures (see the Supplementary Appendix).",

Although the two solutions were visibly distinct, participants remained unaware of the trial-group assignment owing to the use of opaque syringes and to the fact that talc or placebo was administered in a manner\nsuch that the patients could not see the procedure (see the Supplementary Appendix).\nParticipants were discharged after a 2-hour minimum period of observation, and the next drainage took place between 12 and 36 hours after the administration of talc or placebo. Subsequent drainage frequency was determined by the  local  investigating  team  but  was  at  least twice per week for the duration of the trial.",

The main analysis for each outcome was performed according to the intention-to-treat principle; all the participants with an observed outcome were included in the analysis according to their assigned trial group. 15 All  the  analyses  used  minimization 11 variables as covariates in regression models. 16,17 All the tests were two-sided, and results were considered to be significant at the 5% level.\nThe primary outcome was analyzed with the\nuse of a competing-risk time-to-event regression model, with death as the competing risk. 18 Participants who did not die or have the primary outcome had their data censored at day 35 after randomization or at the point of last contact.\nThe original  statistical  analysis  plan  stipulated that an interim analysis for efficacy would take place after the randomization of 100 participants  and  that  a  significance  threshold  of 0.048 was required at final analysis. 19  However, after good recruitment of participants, the trial steering  committee  and  data  and  safety  monitoring  committee  recommended  that  the  trial continue to its original target of 154 participants undergoing randomization, without an interim analysis being performed. The trial protocol and statistical analysis plan were therefore amended, and a P value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance (see the Supplementary Appendix).",

      "content": "Our randomized trial compared the combination of talc and indwelling pleural catheter with placebo and indwelling pleural catheter in patients with malignant pleural effusion who were outpatients.  Our  primary-outcome  results,  which were backed up by robust sensitivity analyses, strongly suggest that the administration of talc through an indwelling pleural catheter was significantly more efficacious than the use of an indwelling pleural catheter alone among patients without substantial lung entrapment. Patients in the talc group were more than twice as likely as\nthose in the placebo group to meet the criteria for successful pleurodesis. Success rates at day 70 suggested that pleurodesis was maintained to a  point  that  is  clinically  relevant  for  patients with short median survival. 7\nAlthough  the  use  of  an  indwelling  pleural catheter has been shown to lead to a reduction in symptoms, 20 there are potential drawbacks to long-term treatment, including the inconvenience of regular drainage (with associated health care costs) 21 and  risks  of  infection. 22 Previous  data suggest  an  average  incidence  of  spontaneous pleurodesis of approximately 45% (at approximately  2  months) when only an indwelling pleural catheter is used. 20 However, Wahidi et al. recently examined the influence of frequency of drainage through an indwelling pleural catheter (daily vs. standard alternate day) in a population of patients with malignant pleural effusion in North\nAmerica, 9 and  they  found  rates  of  successful pleurodesis  at  12  weeks  of  47%  in  the  dailydrainage  group  versus  24%  in  the  standarddrainage group. In addition, the rate of device removal in the indwelling-pleural-catheter group in the Australasian Malignant Pleural Effusion (AMPLE) trial was 28.8%. 23  In combination with the results of our trial, these data imply that the true incidence of spontaneous pleurodesis is considerably lower than the incidence that has been previously reported in retrospective case series. 24,25\nApproximately 40% of the patients who had undergone randomization had at least one adverse event during the trial - an overall proportion  similar  to  that  in  the  indwelling-pleuralcatheter group of the Second Therapeutic Intervention in Malignant Effusion (TIME2) trial. 5 However, the majority (68%) of the adverse events in our trial were considered to be unrelated to the intervention and tended to represent disease progression. We did not observe any excess in adverse events - specifically, blockage of the indwelling  pleural  catheter,  fluid  complexity, drainage complications, or death - in the talc group. This finding suggests that the administration  of  talc  through  an  indwelling  pleural catheter in an outpatient setting was not detrimental, either to the patient or the device.\nThere are limitations to our trial. During the short but intense follow-up period, we assessed the early effects of the trial intervention, but we are  unable  to  comment  on  the  effects  of  the administration  of  talc  through  an  indwelling pleural catheter beyond 70 days. In addition, it could be argued that our definition of pleurodesis, although pragmatic and easily reproducible, did  not  attempt  to  assess  the  true  degree  of\nvisceroparietal adhesion formally - for example, with the use of thoracic ultrasonography, an approach that although reported is not yet validated. 10 Finally, because relatively high numbers of patients were excluded before randomization, the results we observed may apply to only a selected group of patients with malignant pleural effusion.\nIn conclusion, our data showed that patients who had malignant pleural effusion without substantial  lung  entrapment  and  who  chose  treatment with an indwelling pleural catheter had a greater chance of pleurodesis when talc administration was part of the treatment protocol than when the indwelling pleural catheter was used alone.\nSupported  by  an  unrestricted  research  grant  from  Becton Dickinson.\nDr.  Bishop  reports  receiving  educational  fees  and  donated medical equipment from Rocket Medical U.K. and educational fees and equipment from Becton Dickinson; Dr. Ahmed, receiving grant support from Becton Dickinson and GE Medical; Dr. Psallidas, being employed by AstraZeneca in addition to his affiliation with University of Oxford; Dr. Lee, receiving grant support and medical supplies from Rocket Medical U.K. and fees for serving on an advisory board from Becton Dickinson; Dr. Rahman, receiving consulting fees from Rocket Medical U.K.; Dr. Miller, receiving lecture fees and travel support from Gilead Sciences and lecture fees from Janssen, Merck, and ViiV Healthcare; and Dr. Maskell, receiving grant support and consulting fees  from  Becton  Dickinson  and  grant  support  from  Rocket Medical U.K. No other potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\nWe thank Ms. Sharon Standen, Ms. Bethan Watts, Mr. David Hutton, Dr. Ramon Luengo-Fernandez, Ms. Karen Cooper, Dr. Ly-Mee Yu, Dr. Tim Peto, Dr. Duncan Geddes, Dr. Amelia Clive, Dr.  Oliver  Bintcliffe,  Dr.  Duneesha  de  Fonseka,  Dr.  Anthony Edey, Ms. Penny Senior, Ms. Janet Iles, Mr. Simon Strange, and all the members of the research teams at each site, the community nursing teams, and the patients and carers for contributions to the conduct of the trial.",
