    "abstract": "Background: Navigation bronchoscopy has seen rapid development in the past decade in terms of new navigation techniques and multi-modality approaches utilizing different techniques and tools. This systematic review analyses the diagnostic yield and safety of navigation bronchoscopy for the diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary nodules suspected of lung cancer.\nMethods: An extensive search was performed in Embase, Medline and Cochrane CENTRAL in May 2022. Eligible studies used cone-beam CT-guided navigation (CBCT), electromagnetic navigation (EMN), robotic navigation (RB) or virtual bronchoscopy (VB) as the primary navigation technique. Primary outcomes were diagnostic yield and adverse events. Quality of studies was assessed using QUADAS-2. Random effects meta-analysis was performed, with subgroup analyses for different navigation techniques, newer versus older techniques, nodule size, publication year, and strictness of diagnostic yield definition. Explorative analyses of subgroups reported by studies was performed for nodule size and bronchus sign.\nResults: A total of 95 studies (n = 10,381 patients; n = 10,682 nodules) were included. The majority (n = 63; 66.3%) had high risk of bias or applicability concerns in at least one QUADAS-2 domain. Summary diagnostic yield was 70.9% (95%-CI 68.4%-73.2%). Overall pneumothorax rate was 2.5%. Newer navigation techniques using advanced imaging and/or robotics (CBCT, RB, tomosynthesis guided EMN; n = 24 studies) had a statistically significant higher diagnostic yield compared to longer established techniques (EMN, VB; n = 82 studies): 77.5% (95%-CI 74.7%-80.1%) vs 68.8% (95%-CI 65.9%-71.6%) (p < 0.001). Explorative subgroup analyses showed that larger nodule size and bronchus sign presence were associated with a statistically significant higher diagnostic yield. Other subgroup analyses showed no significant differences.\nConclusion: Navigation bronchoscopy is a safe procedure, with the potential for high diagnostic yield, in particular using newer techniques such as RB, CBCT and tomosynthesis-guided EMN. Studies showed a large amount of heterogeneity, making comparisons difficult. Standardized definitions for outcomes with relevant clinical context will improve future comparability.",

      "content": "Peripheral  pulmonary  nodules  are  a  common  finding  and  often present  a  diagnostic  challenge.  The  increased  resolution  of  CT,  the increased use of CT for a variety of indications (for both pulmonary and non-pulmonary disease), and the implementation of CT screening programs have led to an increase in their incidence [1]. When these pulmonary  nodules  are  suspected  to  be  malignant,  as  determined  by prediction models utilizing patient and nodule characteristics, imageguided minimally invasive biopsy is indicated [2].\nNavigation  bronchoscopy  is  a  frequently  performed  method  to sample  peripheral  pulmonary  nodules.  Conventionally,  it  conveyed fluoroscopy-guided transbronchial biopsy by a standard flexible bronchoscope, with a limited diagnostic yield of around 37% [3]. To improve diagnostic  yield,  new  technologies  were  developed.  Electromagnetic navigation (EMN) and virtual bronchoscopy (VB) were primarily aimed at optimizing navigation. Ultrathin bronchoscopy (UTB) was often utilized in combination with VB and facilitated the navigation process but also  offered  direct  visualization.  Radial  endobronchial  ultrasound (rEBUS) did not offer any additional navigation possibilities but could confirm  correct  positioning.  In  a meta -analysis,  Wang-Memoli  et  al. already showed in 2012 that these techniques were able to obtain a navigation success of 95% and a diagnostic yield of 70% [4], illustrating that  with  navigation  assistance  considerable  improvements  in  diagnostic yield could be achieved, but there was still a discrepancy between reaching the target and obtaining a diagnosis.\nNewer  technologies  integrating  advanced  imaging  support  have aimed to reduce this gap. Pre-existing techniques such as cone-beam CT are now being applied for navigation bronchoscopy (CBCT-NB) and can be  used  as  a  navigation  technique  but  also  gives  precise  positioning confirmation [5]. The implementation of tomosynthesis techniques in EMN aims at reducing CT to body divergence resulting in more accurate sampling (fEMN) [6]. Robot-assisted bronchoscopy (RB), aims at further optimizing navigation accuracy, positioning, and tissue sampling [7]. The combined use of these techniques might further increase diagnostic yield [5].\nThere is a growing body of literature on these different techniques, with unfortunately a large amount of heterogeneity in the definitions used for outcomes such as diagnostic yield. This makes it difficult to compare results across studies, especially because it is not always clearly reported  which  definition  researchers  applied.  A  recent  study  has increased interest in creating more uniform definitions to improve the comparability of different studies [8].\nGiven  the  development  of  new  technologies  and  their  increased combined use in the last decade, it is important to assess if diagnostic yield for pulmonary nodule evaluation has improved while applying the newly proposed definitions for reporting this outcome. This systematic review  evaluates  the  diagnostic  yield  and  safety  of  navigation  bronchoscopy in the diagnostic work-up of patients with peripheral pulmonary nodules suspected of lung cancer.",

      "content": "Using the search strategies in supplemental Table S1, we searched Embase, Medline, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for primary diagnostic studies published from inception to the  6th  of  May  2022.  Subsequently,  two  researchers  independently assessed titles and abstracts of all retrieved records for potential relevance  and  disagreements  were  discussed.  Full  texts  of  potentially eligible studies were independently assessed for final inclusion by both\nresearchers. Again, discrepancies were discussed until a consensus was reached.  Additionally,  previously  published  systematic  reviews  were checked for missed studies, which were included for further assessment if found (n = 14) [9 -11]. We included primary studies that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy or diagnostic yield of EMN, VB, CBCT, or RB as the primary navigation tool in patients with peripheral pulmonary nodules suspected of lung cancer. We excluded studies focusing on other navigation techniques  as the sole tool under  investigation, such  as (augmented) fluoroscopy (AF), UTB,and rEBUS. These tools assist in the navigation  process  but  are  not  a  strict  navigation  technique  itself. However, we included studies performed in a multi-modality setting, where a combination of navigation techniques (e.g., CBCT with EMN or VB with UTB) was used. We excluded studies with average or median pulmonary nodule sizes larger than 3 cm (limiting lesion size to T1 tumors[12]), or studies explicitly reporting that lesions could be reached with  traditional  bronchoscopy.  We  also  excluded  studies  with  tumor marking as research aim (e.g. marking of a nodule with a radiopaque marker with the aim to assist in surgery), studies in languages other than English, or studies including < 10 study participants.",

All other findings are categorized as non-diagnostic.\n(2)  Intermediate:  as  strict  definition,  but  also  non-specific  benign outcomes (e.g. non-specific inflammation) are considered diagnostic if confirmed benign with follow-up.\n(3)  Liberal:  as  intermediate,  but  also  nondiagnostic  samples  (e.g., alveolar tissue and blood) are considered diagnostic if confirmed benign with follow-up.\nThe  definition  was  classified  as  not  reported  (fourth  category)  if insufficient explanation was given on how diagnostic yield was calculated or if mandatory follow-up to confirm non-specific benign outcomes was not specified and could not be deduced from the study report.",

The results were aggregated in a forest plot with 95%  confidence  intervals  (95%-CI),  using  the  Hartung-Knapp-SidikJonkman  correction.  A  95%  prediction  interval  (95%-PI)  was  calculated  for  the  summary  diagnostic  yield.  The  95%-PI  provides  a  95% probability of what the diagnostic yield of a new (future) study will be and  is  therefore  a  measure  to  assess  the  variability  across  included studies. A generalized mixed linear model was used to perform subgroup analyses. Subgroup analyses were performed following two strategies.\n1)  Subgroup analysis was performed by dividing all included studies based  on  the  following  criteria:  different  navigation  techniques (EMN vs. VB vs. RB vs. CBCT), longer established and more recent techniques  (EMN  and  VB  vs.  CBCT,  RB,  and  fEMN),  strictness  of definition of diagnostic yield (strict vs. intermediate vs. liberal vs. not reported), median/mean nodule size ( < 20 mm vs. ≥ 20 mm), and year of publication (before 2012 vs. after 2012, to provide a comparison with a previous meta -analysis  by  Wang-Memoli et al. [4]). For all EMN studies, an additional subgroup analysis was performed  (no  additional  navigation  tools  vs.  additional  navigation tools vs. fEMN).\n2)  Additional  explorative  analyses  were  performed  for  studies  that specifically  reported  on  diagnostic  yield  for  subgroups  based  on nodule  size < 20  mm  vs. ≥ 20  mm  or  bronchus  sign  presence (negative vs. positive). These subgroups of individual studies were separately pooled, and the overall summary results were compared. In this analysis, only studies that reported results for both the subgroups (i.e. both for patients with nodules < 20 mm and ≥ 20 mm, or both  for  patients  with  a  negative  bronchus  sign  and  a  positive bronchus sign) were included, while studies that only reported results for a single subgroup (e.g. only for patients with nodules < 20 mm, or with a negative bronchus sign) were excluded.",

Sixty studies reported subgroup analysis for individual nodule size < 20 and ≥ 20 mm, resulting in a summary diagnostic yield of 67.4% (95%-CI 63.1%-71.5% and 95%-PI 43.9%-83.9%) versus 79.4% (95%-CI 76.0%-82.4% and 95%-PI 46.6%-94.8%), respectively. Furthermore, 36 studies reported subgroup analysis for bronchus sign positive Odds ratio (or) negative lesions, resulting in a summary diagnostic yield of 73.7% (95%-CI 69.4%-77.6% and 95%-PI 50.8%-88.3%) versus 54.1% (95%-CI 48.5%-59.6% and 95%-PI 25.2 -80.3%), respectively.\nTo illustrate the clinical correlation of the different definitions for diagnostic yield, a hypothetical diagnostic patient pathway is shown in Fig. 3. When a patient is diagnosed based on the navigation procedure without  follow-up,  the  summary  diagnostic  yield  is  68.6%  (95%-CI 61.7%-74.8%) for patients with nodules < 20 mm and 66.7% (95%-CI 56.8%-75.3%) for nodules ≥ 20 mm. This is based solely on studies with a strict definition for diagnostic yield as it does not incorporate followup. The diagnostic yield after follow-up is 72.1% (95%-CI 66.1%-77.5%) and 69.7% (95%-CI 65.4%-73.7%) for nodules < 20 mm and ≥ 20 mm, respectively, based on both studies with a strict and intermediate definition of diagnostic yield. These studies require representative plausible samples  for  both  malignant  and  benign  lesions,  which  need  to  be confirmed by follow-up in case of non-specific outcomes. The outcomes from all studies with a liberal definition for diagnostic yield or from those who did not report a definition cannot be extrapolated to real life practice and were therefore excluded from this hypothetical diagnostic patient flow.",

      "content": "(strict)\n(strict and intermediate)\nsystematic reviews published in recent years. Most recently Nadig et al. [110] reported a similar summary diagnostic yield of 69.4%, although applying  different  study  selection  criteria  than  we  did.  Despite  the comparable overall results, our systematic review performed different subgroup  analyses,  and  categorized  and  evaluated  studies  by  newly proposed definitions of diagnostic yield [8] to underline the importance of  their  uniformity.  We  furthermore  propose  a  workflow  that  helps interpret the clinical value of different navigation bronchoscopy techniques  during  the  diagnostic  phase  and  follow-up  in  case  of  nonconclusive initial findings (Fig. 3).\nIn  the  subgroup  analyses,  we  compared  more  recently  developed navigation techniques utilizing advanced imaging and/or robotics with longer-established  ones.  The  diagnostic  yield  seems  to  improve  with newer technologies based on this analysis. However, we also found that there is significant heterogeneity in study criteria, reflected by the large overall  95%  prediction  interval  of  48.1%-86.6%.  This  heterogeneity limits the comparability of technologies and studies over time. We hypothesize this might also explain the outcome that our diagnostic yield has not changed more considerably with the advent of improved technology when compared to the meta -analysis by Wang-Memoli et al. as published in 2012 [4].\nThe reported diagnostic yield estimates vary greatly across studies, ranging from 26.7% to 97%. There are multiple potential explanations for  this  variability:  heterogeneity  in  study  methodology  (e.g.  risk  of bias), operator experience (e.g. learning curve analyses [17,66]), test characteristics or patient characteristics (e.g. nodule size ranging from 12.8  mm  to  29  mm  mean/median  size,  or  bronchus  sign  presence ranging from 0% to 100%). The impact of patient/nodule characteristics is highlighted by the results of our explorative subgroup analyses. We found  that  larger  nodules  and  bronchus  sign  presence  resulted  in  a significantly higher diagnostic yield. When looking at the entire group of included studies, however, this difference is averaged out.\nPrevious studies have shown that the employed sampling strategy may also impact diagnostic yield [112,113]. For example, Gildea et al. [111] reported that by adding biopsy forceps or an aspiration needle to the sampling strategy, sensitivity improved by 9.3% and 5.8% respectively.  Although  almost  all  studies  described  some  form  of  sampling strategy, a clear presentation of results per sampling tool/strategy or a structured sampling strategy was rarely presented, precluding further subgroup analysis of this parameter. The same applied to other factors that may influence diagnostic yield, such as the type of lesion or pretest probability  of  malignancy.  Such  incomplete  reporting  makes  it  very difficult to evaluate and compare study results.\nIn  a  hypothetical  cohort,  Vachani  et  al.  recently  illustrated  that diagnostic yield may vary by 13% -22% depending on whether a strict versus a liberal definition was used [8]. We assessed how diagnostic yield was defined and calculated across primary studies, and applied the proposed categorization by Vachani et al.. This remains subject to discussion as especially older studies have not been designed with these definitions in mind. In our analysis, a considerable number of studies (n = 20) provided insufficient information on how diagnostic yield was calculated to allow categorization. This does not mean that these studies were not diligent in obtaining objective diagnoses, only that we could not reproduce how these diagnoses were made for non-malignant findings. Moreover, follow-up duration to determine true benign findings is\nanother point of attention as it is heterogeneously reported. The optimal follow-up duration is not well established, but shorter follow-up will increase the risk of missing slow-growing malignancies. All previously mentioned factors highlight the need for a standardized and objective description  of  the  outcomes  of  navigation  bronchoscopy.  Improved adherence to reporting guidelines such as STARD 2015 for diagnostic accuracy studies [112] is likely to improve this situation.\nThis systematic review showed a good safety profile for navigation bronchoscopy, but the QUADAS-2 assessment also showed that the risk of  bias  for  the  reporting  of  adverse  events  could  not  be  determined adequately in 79% of included studies. Adverse events are most likely reported  truthfully,  but  the  methodological  assessment  shows  that structured  reporting  of  adverse  events  according  to  a  predetermined protocol  is  uncommon.  Similar  to  how  diagnostic  yield  is  defined, structured reporting of adverse events will most likely lead to better comparability between research.",

      "content": "This systematic review illustrates that the navigation bronchoscopy field  has  become  an  important  area  of  research  with  a  multitude  of technological options. Real-life practice resembles the large variability described  in  this  systematic  review.  The  peripheral  nodule  patient population is heterogeneous in nature and not every patient requires the same approach. Multimodality approaches to navigation bronchoscopy have become standard practice, with 75/95 studies in this systematic review  employing  such  an  approach.  The  use  of  multiple  different navigation techniques and tools will most likely increase the possibility of obtaining a diagnosis. However, not every hospital has access to the same resources, both in access to technology and in financial assets. A recent decision  analytical  cost-effectiveness  study  [113]  showed  that diagnostic yield is the most important factor in determining the costeffectiveness of a navigation bronchoscopy modality. This implies that the  more  recently  developed  navigation  techniques  can  be  costeffective,  even  while  being  initially  more  expensive  to  acquire  or implement. Also important, however, will be an optimal preprocedural patient  selection.  By  selecting  the  correct  patients  for  the  employed navigation technique, a high diagnostic yield can be obtained. This will result in the most cost-effective manner of diagnosis. One of the challenges going forward will be to determine which patient in what hospital setting will benefit the most from which navigation approach.\nRegardless of how the navigation bronchoscopy research field will develop in coming years, standardized and clearly described definitions for outcomes and on how to report adverse events will be indispensable for  more  accurate  comparisons  between  studies  and  technologies. Ideally, from a patient perspective, the strict and intermediate definitions of diagnostic yield will become more widely employed as these definitions can be correlated to daily practice.",
