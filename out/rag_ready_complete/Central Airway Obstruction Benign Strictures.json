      "content": "The vertical length, location of the stenotic airway, and presence of multifocal disease affect treatment options. Accurate measurements of the involved airway ' s length and precise location in relation to the vocal cords and main carina are relevant for determining suitability for open or bronchoscopic interventions. Multidetector CT often is used in the assessment of LTS and is more useful than spirometry for identifying the location, extent, severity, and morphology of airway narrowing but may be affected by the respiratory phase, presence of secretions, and intra- and interobserver variability. 8,9 Bronchoscopic optical coherence tomography and balloon-based radial probe endobronchial ultrasound allow cross-sectional imaging of the airway wall microlayers 10 but are not used routinely in clinical practice (Fig 2).\nWhite light bronchoscopic evaluation remains the standard of practice for suspected CAO, allowing for quantitative measurements of stenosis and direct assessment of vertical extent and stricture complexity. 11 Stricture complexity is a predictor of outcome after bronchoscopic and surgical interventions. Simple strictures, de /uniFB01 ned as < 1 cm in vertical extent and without malacia, typically are treated with laser-assisted mechanical dilation, and stent insertion should be avoided because it can lead to further airway injury and potentially worsen resectable disease. 12 Inoperable complex strictures, however, often require stent insertion.\nThe morphology (shape) of the stricture can clarify the cause. Table 3 summarizes the terms used to describe the morphology of LTS and possible treatments for each group on the basis of morphology. Complex, circumferential stenosis most commonly occurs because of PITS, whereas triangular strictures are due to tracheostomy with cartilaginous injury. 13 A stricture ' s morphology impacts /uniFB02 ow dynamics, symptom severity, and treatment options.\nPTTS and PITS appear to be the most common histologically benign strictures, 13,14 followed by idiopathic and autoimmune causes (eg, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, sarcoidosis, ulcerative colitis). Strictures also can occur as a /uniFB01 brotic sequel of endobronchial TB. Those following lung transplantation are thought to be secondary to tissue ischemia and altered in /uniFB02 ammatory response. A thorough search for an underlying cause is warranted prior to labeling the stricture as idiopathic. This search is particularly relevant\n]",

      "content": "The work of breathing in CAO depends on the pressure change along the stenotic airway and is affected mainly by the degree of obstruction and air /uniFB02 ow velocity.\nAlthough it is not entirely justi /uniFB01 ed by physiologic or outcome studies, CAO is de /uniFB01 ned as occlusion of > 50% of the trachea, mainstem bronchi, bronchus intermedius, or a lobar bronchus. 16 In mild tracheal narrowing (ie, # 50% reduction in cross-sectional area [CSA]), pressure drop is similar to that which occurs through the normal glottic opening and, therefore, is unlikely to cause symptoms. 17 Moderate obstruction (51%-70% reduction in CSA) produces variable\n]\nsymptoms with signi /uniFB01 cant pressure drops occurring at higher /uniFB02 ow rates (eg, during exercise). Sedentary patients, however, usually remain asymptomatic at this stage. Severe stenosis ( > 71% reduction in CSA) results in signi /uniFB01 cant pressure drop even at a low /uniFB02 ow rate, causing symptoms at rest or with mild exertion, and may warrant prompt intervention. An objective assessment of the degree of airway narrowing and functional status, therefore, is warranted. 1 Speci /uniFB01 cally in patients with LTS, the Medical Research Council dyspnea scale had a high interobserver correlation in a variety of respiratory diseases and correlated with spirometry and response to therapy. 18\nPatients with LTS, however, may have symptoms other than dyspnea, so a more global assessment of functional impairment is warranted in addition to assessment of dyspnea and /uniFB02 ow limitation. Spirometry and /uniFB02 ow\nvolume loops may detect air /uniFB02 ow limitation and can be used to monitor physiologic changes following interventions. The classic pattern of truncation of inspiratory and expiratory limbs on the /uniFB02 ow volume loop, however, lacks sensitivity and usually is seen when the tracheal lumen already is reduced to 6 to 8 mm. In addition, spirometry does not identify the precise location, extent, or morphology of the airway narrowing. 8 Patients with subglottic stenosis also may develop dysphagia and dysphonia. Thus, voice and swallowing assessments complete a comprehensive LTS evaluation (Table 2).",

These data suggest that practitioners use a multitude of stent types and that the initial success rate is high. This /uniFB01 nding is offset, however, by the recurrence of stenosis after stent removal or complication rates. The exact timing for stent removal and optimal stent insertion selection criteria remain unknown. Predictors of success of stent insertion include stenoses < 1 cm in vertical extent and stenoses without associated malacia (eg, chondritis). It appears, however, that there is inadequate airway patency in > 50% of patients after stent removal at 7 to 32 months after stent insertion. The success rate of bronchoscopic treatment once stents are removed (usually after at least 6 months) in cases of complex stenoses is low (17.6%), suggesting the need for\nlong-term indwelling airway stents.

However, for bronchus intermedius strictures, one series suggested that the use of covered SEMS may not offer a therapeutic advantage over balloon dilation alone. 32 Silicone stent insertion after dilation may offer a less traumatic alternative to insertion of SEMS. 31 No direct comparison studies evaluated SEMS and silicone stents in this patient population. We believe that stent choice often is affected by local expertise and practice.

During maximal forced expiration, with development of highly negative transmural pressure in the airway segment downstream (ie, mouthward) from the site of /uniFB02 ow limitation (choke point) (Fig 5), even healthy individuals can demonstrate substantial intrathoracic tracheobronchial narrowing. This process is exaggerated in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and morbid obesity (Fig 3). 60,61 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and morbid obesity in /uniFB02 uence several aspects of airway /uniFB02 ow leading to EDAC (Fig 5). Expiratory collapse is associated signi /uniFB01 cantly with BMI, with worse tracheal collapse among patients who are morbidly obese. 39,60 Studies also suggest that the prevalence of both TBM and EDAC is related directly to age, sex (female), and asthma severity, with EDAC being much more frequent than 40\nTBM in all patients with asthma.\nAlthough EDAC, de /uniFB01 ned as > 70% reduction in CSA during expiration because of bulging of the posterior membrane, was found in 17% of patients in another study, there was no correlation between the degree of obstruction and the results from pulmonary function tests, supporting\nthe current understanding that EDAC is a CT or bronchoscopy imaging /uniFB01 nding localized downstream from the choke points and, thus, not responsible for /uniFB02 ow limitation. 39,62 Healthy people may have EDAC without any effects on expiratory /uniFB02 ow. EDAC was seen in 78% of healthy subjects with normal pulmonary function test results, with some healthy individuals having 80% to 90% CSA reduction. 63 The likely preferred method for clarifying /uniFB02 ow limitation in EDAC requires intraluminal airway pressure measurements across the collapsing airway. 64 Old physiologic studies using airway pressure measurements show no pressure drop along the collapsible airway in EDAC. 62 A systematic evaluation of patients with severe EDAC (71%-100% collapse), however, has not yet been performed. Such a study potentially could clarify the true physiologic impact of EDAC and assist in patient selection for membranous tracheoplasty or stent insertion.",

On the basis of the current understanding of air /uniFB02 ow physiology in these patients, we believe that stent insertion should be reserved for patients with severe TBM not responding to the treatment of the underlying disorder and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). TBM due to relapsing polychondritis is one such disease for which one or more stents are often necessary because of a diffuse lack of airway cartilaginous support (Fig 6). For EDAC, NIPPV can be offered with nocturnal and intermittent application during the day, with pressure settings determined during bronchoscopic titration (Fig 6). 65-67\nQOL and functional status are improved in the short term in 70% and dyspnea in 90% of patients after silicone stent insertion for ECAC. The FEV1, however, does not seem to improve after stent insertion or membranous tracheoplasty. 48,50 Almost 10% of these patients may have bronchoscopy-related complications. 48 Stent-related adverse events in these disorders are also common and include obstruction from mucous plugging and migration and require multiple bronchoscopies. 50 Case series also report on improved airway patency and symptoms without immediate major complications after the use of SEMS for TBM, but stent-related complications, including stent fracture, can occur and require removal. 68 On the basis of the limited available evidence, for patients\nwith severe, diffuse, and symptomatic TBM, we suggest that silicone stent insertion be used to improve dyspnea and QOL. In some centers, silicone stents are used as a bridge to membranous tracheoplasty or as a de /uniFB01 nitive therapy in patients who are not surgical candidates. Future algorithms should include airway pressure measurements to determine whether the collapsing segment is /uniFB02 ow limiting as an alternative to a proposed stent trial. 62 For patients with TBM, on the basis of the 2005 Food and Drug Administration warning, the previously studied metallic stents cannot be recommended for improving dyspnea or QOL.

In all other patients, the goal of CAO management is to restore airway patency to improve symptoms or prevent postobstructive pneumonia. Airway patency can be achieved with multiple modalities, including laser therapy, contact\nAsthma: increased Rus\nChronic bronchitis:\nincreased Rus\nEmphysema: decreased Pst\nMorbid obesity: positive Ppl throughout the chest\nV = (Palv-PL)/ Rus\n.\n.\nD\nC\nelectrocautery, argon plasma coagulation, cryotherapy, photodynamic therapy, brachytherapy, and airway stenting. 72 The approach to malignant CAO is variable among clinicians and institutions. It also seems unlikely that one method of endobronchial debulking is superior to another. The decision to place an airway stent, however, has important consequences for the patient and health-care use. Appropriate patient and stent selection criteria are summarized in this section.\nThe decision to place an airway stent following opening of a narrowed airway is based on its ability to prevent airway reocclusion. This strategy must be balanced with the long-term complications associated with an airway foreign body (ie, stent). Published literature on the outcomes and complications of airway stenting is composed mostly of small case series, cohort studies, and case reports. A summary of the original research articles published between 2005 and 2015 on stent insertion for malignant CAO is provided in e-Table 4.\nSeveral larger-scale cohort and registry studies have provided more insight into the risks and bene /uniFB01 ts associated with airway stenting and other bronchoscopic interventions for malignant CAO. 73-77 Therapeutic bronchoscopy was successful in reopening of the airway in nearly all patients, and there were few related procedural complications, but the overall stent-related\ncomplication rate varied between 23% and 34% (Table 5). Nearly all of these complications required bronchoscopic intervention for secretion removal, granulation tissue ablation, or stent removal or replacement. There has been an increased appreciation regarding the development of stent-associated respiratory infections. A systematic review showed that 93 of the 501 patients (19%) with airway stents developed a respiratory tract infection. 78 In one study of 72 patients undergoing therapeutic bronchoscopy for malignant CAO, 23 patients (32%) developed a lower respiratory tract infection, 79 which resulted in signi /uniFB01 cant morbidity and mortality, with six patients dying within 14 days of the infection. In another study of 172 patients with stents for malignant CAO, the development of a lower respiratory infection was associated the development of granulation tissue and worsened survival. 80\nSigni /uniFB01 cant heterogeneity regarding patient population, types of airway stents, and consistency in the reporting of complications has limited the generalizability of study /uniFB01 ndings. A multicenter national registry of patients with malignant CAO sought to characterize the risks and bene /uniFB01 ts of therapeutic bronchoscopy better. 16,81 Technical success was achieved in 93% of patients, and airway stents were placed in 36.4% of the procedures. Death within 30 days of the procedure occurred in 119\n[\n]\npatients (14.8%). The placement of a stent increased the odds of death within 30 days by 4.92, with Y stents carrying a greater risk than straight stents. The proximate cause of death in patients with stents was not available, but given that the overall procedure-related complication rate was low (3.9%), it seems that other longer-term events must be responsible. Despite the high technical success rate, clinically signi /uniFB01 cant improvements in dyspnea and health-related QOL were seen in only 48% and 42% of patients, respectively. Patients with greater baseline dyspnea had the greatest improvements in dyspnea score and health-related QOL, and those with lobar obstruction (rather than tracheal, mainstem, or bronchus intermedius obstruction) had the least improvement.\nThis /uniFB01 nding suggests the need for a better understanding of which patients and airway obstruction parameters warrant bronchoscopic interventions. Randomized controlled trials comparing different stents in malignant CAO, however, have not been performed to date. Confounding indications (ie, patients who undergo stenting may have a higher baseline disease burden or limited therapeutic options) cannot be ruled out as an explanation for the worsened outcomes in patients with stents. Given the /uniFB01 ndings from several studies, it seems wise to avoid stent placement if airway patency can be restored with ablative techniques alone.",

      "content": "The histological type, mechanisms of obstruction, extent, location, morphology, degree of airway narrowing, and patient functional status are factors that determine the need for open surgical or bronchoscopic interventions in patients with CAO. We believe that the original articles published in the past decade support the use of airway stents in the following speci /uniFB01 c circumstances:\n1. For patients with inoperable, symptomatic complex PITS and PTTS, and post-TB stenosis, silicone stent insertion may improve dyspnea, and stent removal should be considered 6 to 12 months after insertion. For patients with symptomatic benign strictures, the studied SEMS did not improve dyspnea or QOL long term, and for patients with high tracheal stenosis or subglottic stenosis, SEMS should be avoided.\n2. For patients with severe, diffuse, and symptomatic crescent type TBM, silicone stent insertion may be considered to improve dyspnea and QOL as a bridge to membranous tracheoplasty or as a de /uniFB01 nitive therapy in patients who are not surgical candidates. For EDAC, physiologic studies do not support the use of invasive airway stabilization. In selected patients with TBM and EDAC, NIPPV may be a feasible bene /uniFB01 cial alternative, and metallic stents should be avoided because of high complication rates.\nNR ¼ not reported.\n3. For patients with symptomatic posttransplant anastomotic bronchial stenosis or malacia, stent insertion improved lung function and dyspnea, but it should be reserved for patients who have symptoms and in whom bronchoscopic dilation has failed.\n4. For patients with malignant CAO and moderate to severe symptoms, bronchoscopic interventions, including stent insertion, improved dyspnea, lung function, and QOL, although a better understanding of patient selection is necessary to achieve better outcomes more reliably.",
