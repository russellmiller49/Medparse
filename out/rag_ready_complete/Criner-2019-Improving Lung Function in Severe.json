Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the Spiration Valve System (SVS) versus optimal medical management. Methods: In this multicenter, open-label, randomized, controlled trial, subjects aged 40 years or older with severe, heterogeneous emphysema were randomized 2:1 to SVS with medical management (treatment) or medical management alone (control). Measurements and Main Results: The primary ef /uniFB01 cacy outcome was the difference in mean FEV1 from baseline to 6 months. Secondary effectiveness outcomes included: difference in FEV1 responder rates, target lobe volume reduction, hyperin /uniFB02 ation, health status, dyspnea, and exercise capacity. The primary safety outcome was the incidence of composite thoracic serious adverse events. All analyses were conducted by determining the 95% Bayesian credible intervals (BCIs) for the difference between treatment and control arms. Between October 2013 and May 2017, 172 participants (53.5% male; mean age, 67.4 yr) were randomized to treatment ( n =113) or control ( n =59). Mean FEV1 showed statistically signi /uniFB01 cant improvements between the treatment and control groups -between-group difference at 6 and 12 months, respectively, of 0.101 L (95% BCI, 0.060 -0.141) and 0.099 L (95% BCI, 0.048 -0.151). At 6 months, the treatment group had statistically signi /uniFB01 cant improvements in all secondary endpoints except 6-minute-walk distance. Composite thoracic serious adverse event incidence through 6 months was greater in the treatment group (31.0% vs. 11.9%), primarily due to a 12.4% incidence of serious pneumothorax.

Emphysema alone affects 4.7 million U.S. residents and is associated with progressive physical activity limitations, dyspnea, and reduced quality of life (QoL) (3, 4).\nPharmacologic Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatments have limited bene /uniFB01 t (5). Inhaled therapies reduce annual decline in FEV1 more than placebo; however, observed declines have not been clinically relevant. Other guidelinerecommended treatments include pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) and continuous oxygen therapy (6), but no medical therapy provides relief from the progressive disability of severe emphysema (5).\nThe National Emphysema Treatment Trial showed that lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) improved survival compared with medical treatment in participants with upper-lobe emphysema and low exercise capacity, and also improved health status, dyspnea, exercise capacity, and lung function (7). Although effective, most qualifying individuals (80%) are ineligible for LVRS, primarily due to the potential morbidity associated with surgery and the pattern of emphysema and severity of lung function (8, 9). Thus, there is a substantial need for less invasive treatment options for severe emphysema.\nThe Spiration Valve System (SVS; formerly known as the intrabronchial valve) consists of a one-way valve that blocks inspired air /uniFB02 ow using a /uniFB02 exible umbrella design. This allows for bronchoscopic placement in selected airway regions and limits air /uniFB02 ow to distal portions of the lung affected by emphysema. The SVS has been evaluated in prior clinical studies using a bilateral, partial occlusion treatment methodology (10, 11), which proved ineffective. However, Eberhardt and colleagues (12) along with other subsequent studies (13, 14) showed that unilobar total occlusion may\nprovide similar physiologic and clinical bene /uniFB01 ts to LVRS, including reduced hyperin /uniFB02 ation, leading to improved lung function and clinical status, in a minimally invasive and potentially reversible manner (15).\nPrevious studies using endobronchial valves to treat patients with hyperin /uniFB02 ated emphysema have reported that absence of collateral ventilation is pivotal in achieving lobar atelectasis, the overall treatment goal of this therapy (13, 16, 17). Collateral ventilation can be assessed using a balloontipped catheter placed bronchoscopically to measure /uniFB02 ow and pressure distally in the targeted lobe (18). Alternatively, structural integrity of the /uniFB01 ssure(s) adjacent to the targeted lobe can be assessed by quantitative high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), which also acts as a marker for collateral ventilation and aids in patient and lobe selection (19). The EMPROVE trial represents the largest multicenter study using HRCT analysis of /uniFB01 ssure integrity for patient selection and targeted lobar treatment.\nThe results of the current research have been published in the form of two abstracts presented at the American Thoracic Society (20) and the European Respiratory Society (21) meetings in 2018.",

The current study re /uniFB01 ned objective methods for using quantitative computed tomography as a tool to assess target lobe emphysema characteristics and determine eligibility for bronchoscopic lung volume reduction therapy.\nearly for success or futility. Institutional review boards at each site approved the study, and all participants provided written informed consent (Appendix E1). Eligible participants were 40 years of age or older, met American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society Guidelines criteria for management of stable Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and were able to perform a 6-minute-walk test (6MWT) > 140 m. Disease severity was assessed by HRCT. Participants were required to have > 40% emphysema destruction in the target lobe (assessed at 2 920 Houns /uniFB01 eld units) and a > 10% disease emphysema severity difference with the ipsilateral lobe. The target and ipsilateral lobes were required to be separated by an intact /uniFB01 ssure, estimated visually to be > 90% complete with no segmental vessels crossing between adjacent lobes (as assessed by the CT corelab; MedQIA). Eligible participants had severe dyspnea (Modi /uniFB01 ed Medical Research Council scale [mMRC] > 2); severe obstructive disease FEV1 < 45% of predicted, after bronchodilators; and hyperin /uniFB02 ation de /uniFB01 ned as TLC > 100% and residual volume (RV) > 150% of predicted. Participants agreed to attend required follow-up visits and maintain consistent nutrition and exercise habits during the study period (Appendix E3).\nAll subjects who had not completed a PR program in the prior 2 years were screened to determine if they should complete a PR program before entering the trial (Appendix E4). Baseline testing included pulmonary function, CT, and QoL assessments (Appendix E5). Randomization occurred within the electronic data capture system at a preprocedure visit (2:1 randomization to treatment or control group).

      "content": "The SVS valve is designed for placement in selected regions of bronchial airways using a /uniFB02 exible bronchoscope, deployment catheter, and accompanying loader. The valve has a /uniFB02 exible umbrella that blocks inspired air /uniFB02 ow to distal portions of lungs affected by disease, while allowing air and mucus to clear proximally from treated airways. Valves are removable using a /uniFB02 exible bronchoscope and forceps, if necessary. The valve comprises a frame made of a super-elastic, biocompatible alloy (Nitinol) and a polyurethane membrane (Figure 1). The membrane is held against the airway mucosa by six /uniFB02 exible struts, which expand and contract with airway movement during breathing. The valve is secured in position with /uniFB01 ve anchors and tips that gently penetrate the airway wall to a controlled depth.\nAn airway sizing system and calibrated balloon was used to determine the appropriate valve width size (5, 6, 7, and 9 mm [the 9-mm valve was introduced after the initial 29 subjects had been randomized in the study]) to treat target lobe airways ranging from 4.75 to 8.75 mm. The treatment algorithm called for the complete occlusion of one lobe; this was achieved by using one or more SVS valves to occlude all segments (i.e., lobar, segmental, and/or subsegmental airways). HRCT imaging and, if necessary, lung perfusion was used to select treatment lobes. Either upper or lower lobes could be targeted for treatment; the right middle lobe was not treated in this study. When two lobes both met criteria for emphysema and heterogeneity, the lobe with the lowest perfusion was treated. To limit subsequent adverse events, physicians were asked to follow a checklist to limit procedure duration. Treated patients remained in the hospital for at least 1 day. The total duration of post-procedural hospitalization was at the discretion of the local investigator and within the norms of clinical practice at the local center.",

Based on these analyses, enrollment could be stopped early for futility or probable eventual success, whereas follow-up continued until the last subject reached 6 months. The maximum possible sample size was 220 (Appendix E7). Subjects with missing data were included in the analysis via Bayesian multiple imputation.

Using a 350-ml reduction in TLV as a threshold, 75% of the SVS-treated group achieved a clinically meaningful improvement, with 40% of the entire treatment cohort achieving complete atelectasis of the target lobe.\nThe SVS treatment group also had signi /uniFB01 cantly greater mean RV/TLC improvement. The between-group difference at 6 months was 2 0.039 (95% BCI, 2 0.058 to 2 0.020; 1.0000 PP) in favor of SVS (Table 3 and Appendix E11, Table E11a).\nThere was signi /uniFB01 cantly greater mean improvement in SGRQ (health status) for SVS treatment versus control groups at 6 months, with a between-group difference of 2 13.0 points (95% BCI, 2 17.4 to 2 8.5; 1.0000 PP). Results at 12 months were 2 9.5\npoints (95% BCI, 2 14.4 to 2 4.7; 1.0000 PP) (Table 3 and Appendix E11, Table E12).\nDyspnea, as measured by mMRC, was signi /uniFB01 cantly improved with SVS treatment, with a between-group difference of 2 0.6 (95% BCI, 2 0.9 to 2 0.3; 1.0000 PP) at 6 months and 2 0.9 (95% BCI, 2 1.2 to 2 0.6; 1.0000 PP) at 12 months (Table 3 and Appendix E11, Table E13).\nAlthough not a secondary endpoint of the study, the Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) assessment test scores were improved by 4.3 points at 6 months and 5.3 points at 12 months in the treatment group compared with the control group, and were statistically signi /uniFB01 cant at both time points (Appendix E11, Table E16).\nChange in exercise capacity, measured by 6MWT, was not statistically signi /uniFB01 cant at\nDefinition of abbreviations : 6MWT=6-minute-walk test; BCI = Bayesian credible interval; BMI = body mass index; C = control; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; mMRC=Modified Medical Research Council; O2 = oxygen; RV = residual volume; SGRQ = St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire; T=treatment; TLV = target lobe volume.\n6 months, with a between-group difference of 6.9 m (95% BCI, 2 14.2 to 28.2; 0.7438 PP) (Table 3 and Appendix E11, Table E14).\nTable 2 provides responder rates for all secondary ef /uniFB01 cacy outcomes.",

At 6 months, the incidence of composite thoracic SAEs was 31.0% in the treatment group and 11.9% in the control group for a statistically signi /uniFB01 cant between-group difference of 19.1% (95% BCI, 5.9 -29.7). The higher treatment group incidence was primarily due to a 12.4% (95% BCI, 4.6 -18.6) increased incidence of serious pneumothorax (Appendix E12, Tables E17 and E18), which was statistically signi /uniFB01 cant.\nOver this time, 32 monitored events of pneumothorax were reported, with 18 protocol-de /uniFB01 ned (Appendix E6) serious incidents in 16 (14.2%) of 113 treatment group participants, and 14 nonserious pneumothorax events in 13 (11.5%) treatment group participants. The majority (66%) of these pneumothorax events occurred within 3 days of the procedure, within the average hospital stay duration (Appendix E12, Figure E1). Of the 16 subjects with serious pneumothorax events, 11 (69%) had one or more valves removed per the de /uniFB01 ned pneumothorax management protocol (Appendix E5). Five (5) of these subjects had valves reimplanted upon cessation of the pneumothorax, and this subset showed a TLV reduction of 2 834.0 ml compared with only 2 19.2 ml in those that\ndid not have valves replaced. There were no other statistically signi /uniFB01 cant between-group differences in thoracic SAEs by category.\nThere were six (5.3%) deaths in the treatment group and one (1.7%) death in the control group (Appendix E12, Table E19). This difference between groups was not statistically signi /uniFB01 cant. Only one death (occurring at Day 95 after SVS procedure) was adjudicated by the study clinical events committee as possibly related to the device due to pneumothorax in the contralateral untreated lobe, which did not resolve before death (Table E20).\nThere were no statistically signi /uniFB01 cant between-group differences for non-horacic SAEs, with 11.5% and 3.4% nonthoracic SAEs in the treatment and control groups, respectively (Appendix E12, Table E19).\nLong term (6 -12 mo). Between 6 and 12 months, the incidence of composite thoracic SAEs was 21.4% in the treatment group versus 10.6% in the control group (Appendix E12, Table E17), with a betweengroup difference of 10.7% (95% BCI, 2 3.0 to 21.2), which was not statistically signi /uniFB01 cant. There were no statistically signi /uniFB01 cant between-group differences in thoracic SAEs by category. There were 3 nonserious events of pneumothorax in 2 of 113 (1.7%) treatment subjects, and no additional serious pneumothorax events (Appendix E12, Figure E1). Three SAEs were adjudicated as device related (one case of infection, one of pneumonia, and one death). There were four (3.9%) deaths in the treatment group (one of which was device related) and three (6.4%) in the control group (Appendix E12, Tables E17 and S19; death details in Table E21). There were no unanticipated device-related SAEs or migration, erosion, or expectoration reported through 12 months of follow-up.\nThere were no statistically signi /uniFB01 cant between-group differences for nonthoracic SAEs, with rates of 12.6% and 12.8% in the treatment and control groups, respectively (Appendix E12, Table E19).",

      "content": "The EMPROVE trial evaluated the safety and ef /uniFB01 cacy of the SVS compared with optimal medical management in patients with severe heterogeneous emphysema. Although prior SVS trials using bilateral, partial occlusion of the target lobe did not show consistent improvement (10, 11), the\nDefinition of abbreviations : 6MWT=6-minute-walk test; mMRC=Modified Medical Research Council; NA=not applicable; RV = residual volume; SGRQ = St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire;\nTLV=target lobe volume.\nresults of the EMPROVE trial, with singlelobe, total lobar occlusion, shows marked bene /uniFB01 ts. At 6 months, the primary outcome and a majority of secondary outcome measures were improved in the SVS treatment group compared with the control group. There was a signi /uniFB01 cant betweengroup increase in mean FEV1 from baseline (0.101 L) and a 25.7% between-group difference in FEV1 responder rates (de /uniFB01 ned as improvement of > 15%). These results persisted at 12 months. The SVS treatment group also saw signi /uniFB01 cant reductions in TLV, hyperin /uniFB02 ation, and dyspnea. Improved health status and QoL was observed as an 8.1-point mean reduction in the SGRQ, which exceeds the 4-point minimum score change de /uniFB01 ned as clinically relevant (24). These ef /uniFB01 cacy results are very comparable to other randomized clinical trials using one-way valves in a unilateral lobar treatment paradigm (13, 14, 16, 25).\nAlthough the SVS treatment group performed better on the 6MWT than the control group (between-group difference, 6.9 m), this difference was not statistically signi /uniFB01 cant. In contrast, patients who underwent endobronchial valve treatment in the recent LIBERATE (Lung Function Improvement after Bronchoscopic Lung Volume Reduction with Pulmonx Endobronchial Valves Used in Treatment of Emphysema) trial performed signi /uniFB01 cantly better on 6MWT than control subjects. This improvement is not surprising, as LIBERATE patients were required to maintain a\nsupervised PR program throughout study follow-up (25), and PR has been shown to improve exercise capacity in patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (26). The EMPROVE study was designed with the understanding that only z 40% of patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) actually adhere to a PR program due to problems with access and prohibitive cost (27). As such, EMPROVE subjects were required to have been in a PR program in the 2 years before study enrollment (Appendix E4), but were not mandated to maintain a supervised PR program throughout the study follow-up, with only 34.5% and 32.7% of EMPROVE treatment and control subjects, respectively, maintaining a PR regimen through the 12-month follow-up. Thus, the difference between the two trials highlights the importance of additional exercise training by way of PR in translating improved lung function into enhanced exercise performance.\nMean procedure time in EMPROVE (24 min) was also shorter than that observed in the LIBERATE trial (34 min) (25). This is relevant because shorter procedure times have been associated with fewer procedurerelated complications (11). In the EMPROVE study, post-SVS treatment risks were generally minor and tended to diminish over time. The primary safety outcome, incidence of composite thoracic SAEs, was greater in the treatment than in the control group (31.0% and 11.9%, respectively). However, pneumothorax was the only individual SAEs with signi /uniFB01 cantly\nhigher treatment group incidence, similar to comparable studies (13, 25). Early-onset pneumothorax in the treatment group likely resulted from lung conformation changes due to acute reduction in lung volume by valve therapy, triggering rapid ipsilateral nontargeted lobe expansion, a recognized indicator of successful target lobe occlusion (28). There was no statistically signi /uniFB01 cant difference in mortality between the study groups at any time point. The 5.3% mortality rate in the treatment group is similar to the 3.1 -5.0% documented in other randomized valve trials (11, 25, 29, 30, 31), and lower than the 7.9 -12% documented in randomized LVRS trials (7). There were no unanticipated device-related SAEs.\nThe results of the EMPROVE trial also demonstrate that using HRCT analysis for /uniFB01 ssure integrity > 90% is a useful method to select patients for lack of collateral ventilation that are most likely to achieve targeted lobe atelectasis and improved clinical outcomes. The procedural time for SVS performance was less than other trials using physiological assessment for collateral ventilation, and avoids added procedural costs (32, 33). Moreover, in a broader clinical context, HRCT quantitative assessment of /uniFB01 ssure integrity may be easier to implement.",

A key study limitation was the lack of TLV and hyperin /uniFB02 ation assessments at 12 months, which would have provided mechanistic data to support improvements in functional and QoL parameters. In addition, the EMPROVE study, and other recent multicenter, randomized controlled trials, did not blind either subjects or assessors (16, 25, 34). Although this may introduce bias to the QoL assessments and the 6MWT, it is unlikely that measures such as lung function, TLV, and hyperin /uniFB02 ation would be affected by this approach.",

The SVS offers clinically relevant bene /uniFB01 ts for severely ill patients with emphysema and, although there are risks with the therapy, they are primarily manageable and tend to diminish over time.\nThe results of the EMPROVE trial and other randomized trials of valve therapy have led to the inclusion of endobronchial valve therapy as an important component of the clinical therapy recommendations for the underserved patient population with severe emphysema (35, 36). n\nAuthor disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org.\nAcknowledgment: The authors thank the EMPROVEtrial steering committee, comprised of Douglas Wood, M.D. ( Chair ), Robert Wise, M.D., Felix Herth, M.D., Christopher Cooper, M.D., Paul Jones, M.D., Atul Mehta, M.D., Steve\nSpringmeyer, M.D., Daniel Sterman, M.D., and Greg Sessler; Nawzer Mehta, Ph.D., and Douglas Sheffield, Ph.D., for overall study management; Michelle Tobin, Susan Anton, Tom Matthews, Gerald Guidry, and Eriika Etshokin for investigational center oversight and data monitoring; Lauri DeVore for procedure support and patient recruitment; Jacki Campbell, Victoria Simonnet, and Amanda Whitson for safety reporting and monitoring; Bill Sirokman and David Himes for data management; Andy Mugglin, Ph.D., for performing all statistical analyses; and Caitlin Rothermel, M.P.H., for medical writing and editorial assistance.
