However, despite their widespread use in centers with interventional pulmonology\nand thoracic surgical expertise, due to the paucity of data and guidance on optimal airway stent maintenance ( ' hygiene ' ) regimens there exists signi /uniFB01 cant variation in practice across institutions. 1,2\nMucus plugging after airway stenting occurs as the stent covers the airway epithelium ' s normal mucociliary clearance mechanism. Without this assistance, mucus can build up to occlude the stent, potentially leading to shortness of breath, lower respiratory infections, and even respiratory failure. 3 There are no data evaluating the use of humidi /uniFB01 cation, mucolytics, expectorants, or cough assist devices after placing airway stents. In addition, no extrapolation on stent-related complication mitigation can be made from the scarce published data that clearly de /uniFB01 nes the use of a stent maintenance regimen. 4\nNebulized normal saline (NS) is the most frequently used agent to prevent mucus plugging after airway stenting. 1 NS and its more concentrated versions do this by disrupting ionic bonds within the mucus gel, reducing cross-linking and entanglement, resulting in a reduction in viscosity. 5 In addition, hypertonic saline has been shown in vitro to reduce the formation of bio /uniFB01 lm and growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa , with increasing effectiveness in its more concentrated versions. 6 Consequently, simple and costeffective saline nebulization is a mainstay in the treatment of patients with bronchiectasis to improve mucus clearance. 7 In both cystic /uniFB01 brosis 8 and noncystic /uniFB01 brosis 9 bronchiectasis, hypertonic saline is more effective than NS as airway maintenance therapy. However, these /uniFB01 ndings have not been studied in patients who have undergone airway stent placement. Bronchospasm has been reported with more concentrated saline formulations, 10,11 and caution with their use has been advised, particularly in patients with reactive airway diseases.\nThis pilot study aims to evaluate and compare the effectiveness and safety of 2 different nebulized regimens, NS or 3% saline (3%S), as airway maintenance therapy after airway stent insertion.",

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "content": "Airway stent utilization can be expected to increase in coming years given the expansion of interventional pulmonology. 12 Determining the most effective airway hygiene regimen to maintain stent patency should be a priority. We present the /uniFB01 rst randomized controlled study of two different nebulized saline regimens to prevent mucus plugging in patients who have undergone central airway stenting.\nIn our pilot study, we found a possibly lower incidence of obstructive mucus plugging noted either during scheduled surveillance bronchoscopy (7.7% vs. 40%) or necessitating an emergent bronchoscopy (0% vs. 20%) in the 3%S versus\nNS groups, respectively. Though this evaluation was not part of our initial protocol, we switched both the patients in the NS group that were found to have obstructive mucus plugging requiring an unscheduled bronchoscopy to 3%S and did not note a recurrence of mucus plugging on further surveillance bronchoscopy. There was no obvious relation of complications to either stent type or location; however, our small sample sizes do not allow accurate determination of this. Based on these results, we hypothesize that 3%S may be as or more effective than NS as an airway maintenance regimen. There are reports of bronchospasm in some (nonstent) studies that used inhaled concentrated saline formulations. 7,10,11 We did not encounter any reported side effects or issues with tolerability. However, our\ncomplication and compliance assessments were based on patient reports and not formalized using validated questionnaires. Tolerability should be an outcome evaluated in larger studies, to characterize the risk of bronchospasm more accurately in this population.\nThe effect of surveillance bronchoscopy was not assessed in this study. Despite con /uniFB02 icting evidence of its bene /uniFB01 t, 13,14 it is part of our standard practice since it was shown in a recent study by Lee et al 13 that 60% of asymptomatic patients were found to have at least 1 stentrelated complication during the surveillance bronchoscopy. In our study, despite the use of routine surveillance bronchoscopy with a standardized nebulized regimen to facilitate mucus clearance, 8.7% (2/23) of patients still",

No study has yet demonstrated the superiority of saline nebulization to doing nothing. Moreover, the additive role of bronchodilators like albuterol, expectorants like guaifenesin, mucolytics like acetylcysteine, or devices like /uniFB02 utter valves, has not been established and they are not part of our routine stent maintenance practice. Until further prospective analyses to determine their ef /uniFB01 cacy are carried out, we feel that the expectation of their effectiveness should be managed with caution. 1,2,15 Webelieve that our study may help better design future clinical trials that aim to evaluate the effectiveness of different airway hygiene regimens to maintain stent patency. The effect sizes that we demonstrated can be used to calculate power for determining the ideal sample size for a larger (ideally, multicenter) randomized clinical trial. In addition, we believe, even though single-centered, our study establishes the feasibility of recruitment of patients for such a study; the 34.3% dropout rate we noted should be factored into future study power calculations.\nOur study has several limitations. The pilot design and small sample size prohibit any /uniFB01 rm extrapolations from our data. The lack of blinding for both the investigators and patients, as well as the single-site design, introduces sources of bias. The short follow-up time of 4-6 weeks may be insuf /uniFB01 cient to assess complications or events that happen in the long term associated with airway maintenance, especially for patients who have long-term use of airway stents. Furthermore, for compliance with the prescribed nebulized regimens, we relied on patient reports and did not use a formal assessment tool. In addition, bio /uniFB01 lm assessment, while performed by 2 providers, was still subjective. Moreover, the signi /uniFB01 cance and consequences of varying degrees of bio /uniFB01 lm remain unclear. Our results are relevant to adult patients with central airway stents and may not be extrapolated to lobar or segmental stents, and pediatric patients.",
