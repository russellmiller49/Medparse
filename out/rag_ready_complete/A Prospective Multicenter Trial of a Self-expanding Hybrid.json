The goal is to improve airway lumen patency and quality of life. There are in general 2 classes of stents, silicone and metal. Silicone stents have been available and routinely used since the 1980s. 1,2 They are usually placed using a rigid bronchoscope, under general anesthesia, in the operating room. They have both positive and negative attributes. Advantages of silicone stents include the fact that there is much published data on their use. They are efficacious and inexpensive. In addition, these stents can be removed if needed. The disadvantages include: a need for general anesthesia and a trip to the operating room. In addition, granulation tissue formation around the stent and mucous formation within the stent is common.\nSelf-expanding metal stents, usually made up of nitinol frame that has shape memory, became popular in the 1990s. They have the advantage of being able to be placed in the bronchoscopy suite under local anesthesia under moderate sedation. The disadvantages include difficulty with removal, stent fracture, granulation tissue formation, and infection due to bacterial adherence to the covering.\nIn an attempt to capture the favorable properties of both classes of stents, a completely covered nitinol (hybrid) stent was designed to reduce stent complications (AERO stent, Alveolus Inc, Charlotte, NC) (Fig. 1).\nThe purpose of our study was to assess the safety and efficacy of this new hybrid stent.",

The stent is completely covered with a biocompatible membrane, which minimizes the possibility of tissue in-growth and granuloma formation. A hydrophilic coating in the inner lumen of the stent shall minimize mucous adherence and accumulation. Because the device is cut from a tube of nitinol with a unique design, the stent does not foreshorten or elongate upon delivery. The stent has a slightly larger diameter near the distal and proximal ends (Fig. 1). Both ends are slightly vaulted inwardly to minimize possible airway injury and the formation of granulation tissue at the stent edges.\nThe stent is deployed with a preloaded dedicated delivery system.",

Telephone interviews were conducted at 30 and 90 days to assess improvement in dyspnea scores.\nImprovement in lumen patency was visually assessed by comparison of airway lumen diameter prestent and poststent implant. Success was defined by 50% reduction in stenosis. This assessment was independently confirmed by blinded investigators assessing prebronchoscopy and postbronchoscopy images.\nQuality of life was assessed using a Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI) and Transitional Dyspnea Index (TDI) 3 as a surrogate of quality of life measure. The TDI scores were indicative of improvement (positive integer), no change (score of 0), or deterioration (negative integer) in comparison to the BDI assessed before implant. A change in score of +1 or more indicates a clinically meaningful improvement. A change in score of /C0 1 or more indicates a clinically meaningful worsening of dyspnea.\nA 4-point Likert scale to indicate ease of use and deployment performance was also recorded with 1 being difficult to place and 4 being easy to place.",

      "content": "Sixty-one stents were placed in 56 patients. Patient characteristics and stent deployment location are reported in Table 1. Stents were deployed in the central airways. In all cases, palliative effects were observed. The average\ndegree of lumen occlusion before stent placement was 82%. Improvement in luminal patency was noted in 88% of patients as defined by an increase in luminal diameter of Z 50% ( P <0.05). Success is comparable with images seen in Figures 2 and 3. Dyspnea indices improved after stenting compared with baseline values with an average improvement of 2.9 at 7 days and 3.2 at 30 days ( P <0.05). Improvement at 90 days was not clinically significant ( P Z 0.05) (Table 2). Physician satisfaction with the deployment of the stent was high. Six aspects of the deployment system, including guidewire passage through the catheter, catheter passage into airway, stent release, catheter removal from airway, visualization, and accuracy of stent placement were rated on a 4-point scale where 4 = excellent and 1 = poor. A final average score between ''good'' (3) and ''excellent'' (4) was reported for each aspect with an overall average of 3.57. The stent was determined to be easily deployed.\nThe major complication of stent placement in this study was migration, which occurred in 28% of patients. Other minor stent-related complications included minimal granulation tissue in 5% (n = 3) and infection in 4% (n =2). Complications not related to the stent placement included pain in 7% (n=4) and hemoptysis in 4% (n =2). Tumor in-growth was not observed in this study.\nSurvival after stent placement was 54 (96%) at 7, 46 (82%) at 30 and 38 (68%) at 90 days. Seven patients had their stent removed for the following reasons: response to concomitant therapy resulting in tumor response (n = 2), granulation tissue formation (n = 3), tumor growth at the ends of the stent requiring further stent placement (n =1), and secretion build-up (n = 1).",

The self-expanding hybrid stent provided immediate palliation in nearly all patients with a reasonable complication rate. It provides some of the strengths of both the silicone and metallic stents while eliminating some of the weaknesses. The self-expanding hybrid stent could be placed in the bronchoscopy laboratory under conscious sedation (a strength of selfexpanding metallic stents 4 ) but could be easily removed when needed (a strength of the silicone stent 4 ). The rate of immediate palliation is consistent with other studies in which metallic stents have been used. 5 Early complication rates are also consistent with published literature. In a study of 82 patients with benign and malignant disease, 54.8% of patients required additional procedures to control granulation tissue formation and disease recurrence (tumor in-growth) postimplant. 6 Another study which included 27 patients had an overall complication rate of 50%. Secretion retention in 18% of the patients required additional interventional procedures and 15% of the patients' experienced recurrent dyspnea from granulation tissue formation at the end of the stent. 7 In this study, we observed 3 instances of slight granulation tissue formation which did not require ablation, no instance of tumor in-growth and no occlusion by secretions, though larger studies are needed to confirm these findings. The rate of migration is higher than what one would see with metallic stents yet, within range of what is found with silicone stents. 5 Since the completion of this trial the stent has been modified and struts have been added to reduce the rate of migration. We have reasons to believe that this goal can be accomplished.\nThis study has several strengths. First, it was a prospective multicentered study that is rare for a trial, which evaluates airway stent technology. Second, many important clinical end points were captured. Improvement in luminal patency was blindly assessed. Dyspnea, a surrogate of quality of life, as assessed by the BDI/TDI, was evaluated prestent and poststent placement and complications were recorded out to 90 days. The study has some weaknesses, namely, that long-term follow-up beyond 90 days was not assessed. Not surprisingly in this cancer population, a number of patients died before the end of the study, though none were related to stent placement. Transitional dyspnea scores were not available for many of the patients at the 90-day follow-up due to inability to travel, entrance into hospice care, or loss to follow-up. Transitional dyspnea scores were not recorded for some patients at 7 and 30 days due to removal of the\ndevice or expiration. Additional studies are needed with a longer follow-up period to accurately assess this new stent technology.\nIn summary, the initial experience with this new hybrid stent was positive. The device was easy to deploy, effective in palliating symptoms and, when indicated, was easy to remove. The complication rate was comparable with that reported in the literature and repeat procedures were rarely required. Further trials are needed to assess the long-term outcomes of this new hybrid stent. Preferably, a study should be conducted comparing the new modified stent versus other stent types.",
