In addition, pulmonary metastases from other malignancies, including breast, colon, and renal cell cancer, commonly result in malignant airway obstruction.  1  There are three main types of malignant airway obstruction: endobronchial obstruction, extrinsic compression, and mixed pattern. For endobronchial obstruction, ablative techniques that destroy tissue are indicated, including lasers, electrocautery, argon plasma coagulation (APC), photodynamic therapy, microdebriders, and cryotherapy. For extrinsic compression, stents are used to strengthen the bronchial wall and keep the airway open. For mixed patterns, ablation followed by stenting is usually required. Treatment strategies oft  en are multimodal, and variations exist in how physicians perform therapeutic bronchoscopy.\nPrior studies of therapeutic bronchoscopy for central airway obstruction 2-12  have included both malignant and benign cases, and most were done retrospectively, although some have focused on malignant disease. 13-18 Reported complication rates are low, but complications and outcomes diff  er signifi  cantly depending on the indication for the procedure (ie, malignant vs benign disease, isolated hemoptysis vs central airway obstruction), and in most studies, signifi  cant heterogeneity existed in terms of patient population and indications. 1,4 Many of these studies focused on individual technologies, such as stents, microdebriders, or APC, and most\nwere performed at centers of excellence as part of ongoing research programs. Whether variations in practice patterns aff  ect complication rates is unknown and cannot be answered by single-center studies. In addition, because many previous studies had relatively small sample sizes, formal analysis of rare events like complications has been limited. Whether these results can be generalized to everyday clinical practice is unknown. Additional outcomes data on therapeutic bronchoscopy for malignant central airway obstruction in everyday clinical practice is, therefore, needed to establish benchmarks for quality improvement and clinical eff  ectiveness.\nRegistries are well suited for this purpose because they provide a more generalizable picture of outcomes and clinical eff  ectiveness. We used the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) Quality Improvement Registry, Evaluation, and Education (AQuIRE) program to evaluate therapeutic bronchoscopy for malignant central airway obstruction, focusing on complications and their clinical consequences and 30-day outcomes. Th e primary objective was to quantify the incidence of and risk factors for complications. Th e secondary objective was to quantify the incidence and risk factors for bleeding, hypoxemia, respiratory failure, and 30-day mortality and to evaluate the consequences of complications as measured by escalation in level of care and associated adverse events. Data regarding the success rate of therapeutic bronchoscopy and its impact on dyspnea and quality-adjusted survival have been presented separately. 19",

However,  participating  centers  agreed  to  enter  all  consecutive  patients for  the  duration  of  their  participation.  Institutional  review  board approval was governed by each site (see   e-Appendix 1 for details). The principal investigator for each site was primarily responsible for data quality for that site. Informed consent or a waiver of consent\nwas obtained in accordance with institutional guidelines. Data were entered through the AQuIRE web-based interface using standardized definitions, quality control checks, and protocols as previously described. 21-23\nPatients undergoing therapeutic flexible or rigid bronchoscopy for malignant central airway obstruction were included. Central airway obstruction was defi  ned as occlusion of ≥ 50% of the trachea, mainstem bronchi, bronchus intermedius, or lobar bronchus. Because a registry was used, all clinical decisions, including type of intervention, were left to the discretion of the attending bronchoscopist.\nof Illinois Hospital & Health Sciences Center (Dr Kovitz), Chicago, IL; Chicago Chest Center Interventional Pulmonology (Dr Greenhill), Elk Grove Village, IL; the Department of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine (Dr Casal), Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX; the Department of Internal Medicine (Dr Wahidi), Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Raleigh, NC; the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (Dr Yarmus), Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD; the Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine (Dr Benzaquen), University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH; and the Department of Medicine (Dr Tremblay), University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada.

See   e-Appendix 1 contains for additional details on defi  nitions. Th e average number of cases per month was used as a center-level variable in hierarchical models to assess the relationship between center volume and outcomes. Adverse events were defined as events resulting from the complication that extended hospitalization, required intervention to avoid permanent impairment, were life threatening, or caused disability or death.\nTh   e primary outcome was procedural morbidity, which was defi  ned as any of the following events within 24 h: bleeding requiring intervention, pneumothorax, refractory hypoxemia defi  ned as oxygen saturation , 90% for . 1 min, 1,22 clinically signifi  cant airway injury, hypotension, cardiac arrest or arrhythmia, or unexpected respiratory failure requiring positive pressure ventilation. Secondary outcomes included subsets of complications (ie, bleeding, hypoxemia, respiratory failure), clinical consequences of complications as measured by complications associated with adverse events, need for an escalation in level of care, and death within 30 days. Escalation in level of care, as a measure of resource  utilization,  was  defi  ned  as  admission  to  the  hospital  if  the patient was an outpatient, transfer to the ICU if the patient was an inpatient, or death irrespective of whether there was a complication or\nadverse event (see   e-Appendix 1 for additional details).  For  the  outcome of death within 30 days, we analyzed only fi  rst therapeutic bronchoscopy cases. The reason is that the probability of death within 30 days of the procedure for patients having more than one procedure would not be independent of each other  .",

Complication rates and 30-day mortality also varied signifi  cantly among centers.\nTh e present study is consistent with and adds to the existing body of evidence regarding therapeutic bronchoscopy complications. 1,2,4,5,16,18,26-30  We focused solely on patients with malignant central airway obstruction because prior work has shown that the magnitude of the eff  ect of risk factors varies based on whether the patient has malignant or benign disease. 1  Many previous studies reporting risk factors for therapeutic bronchoscopy failed to make this distinction. In addition, because of the relatively rare nature of complications and the specialized nature of the procedures involved, many prior studies lacked the statistical power necessary to identify risk factors for rare complications. Th e present study is among the largest multicenter cohort studies to focus on malignant airway obstruction, and because of this, it allowed us to identify risk factors for specifi  c types of complications that have not been previously reported. We found that redo bronchoscopy and moderate sedation are associated with higher complication rates. Because moderate sedation use varied signifi  cantly among centers, this provides an\nopportunity for improving outcomes in the future. Of note, although the use of neuromuscular paralysis was associated with lower complication rates on univariate analysis (3% vs 6.7%, P 5 .006), aft  er adjustment for the type of anesthesia, the use of paralysis had no impact on complication rates. Similarly, although spontaneous ventilation was associated with higher complication rates than jet or volume-cycled ventilation, aft  er adjustment for the type of anesthesia, the type of ventilation did not aff  ect complication rates. Importantly, the type of anesthesia used is a patient-level variable at some centers (ie, something decided by the bronchoscopist on a case-by-case basis) and a center-level variable at others (eg, in centers where general anesthesia is not readily available for bronchoscopy). Th e current results suggest that it is important for hospitals to invest the necessary resources to make general anesthesia readily available for therapeutic bronchoscopy.\nWe also found signifi  cant diff  erences among centers in terms of stent use. Th is may be important because 30-day mortality was higher in patients who had stents placed. However, the association between stents and 30-day mortality may be the result of residual confounding or confounding by indication. Specifi  cally, patients requiring stents may have a higher disease burden, and therefore, the observed decrease in survival might be due to these unaccounted-for factors. Th is might also explain why Y stents were associated with higher mortality than tube stents. Similarly, physicians may have been more likely to place stents in patients who had few other treatment options and limited life\n]\n(Continued)",

      "content": "expectancy. However, prior studies have shown that infections are more common in patients undergoing airway stenting and that these infections are associated with a high case fatality rate. 13,14,31  We believe that selectively stenting only patients who really require it is prudent. Although the wide variation in stent use observed among centers (range, 13%-69% of cases; P , .001) could be due to diff  erences in the patient populations being treated, it is probable that the present fi  ndings refl  ect at least some degree of variation among centers in terms of stent strategy.\nStent strategy may diff  er depending on many subtle variations in the underlying indication for airway stenting. In some cases, a stent may be used due to signifi  cant residual luminal stenosis not amenable to ablation. In rare cases, stenting may be used to close a fi  stula. Finally, stents may be used for their barrier eff  ect following successful reopening of the airway with ablative techniques, even though the lumen postablation is . 50% open. In these instances, the physician must make a judgment about whether the risks of recurrent obstruction warrant stenting. It is likely that most of the observed practice variation arises from this last category of patients. Although all patients had at least 50% stenosis prior to bronchoscopy, we did not record the luminal obstruction present at the moment of stenting, only the percentage obstruction, so this outcome analysis can only provide limited insight in this regard. Th is study cannot answer the question of best stent strategy given the limitations inherent in its design, but the study does highlight the need for future work in this area given the wide variations in practice patterns and the associated increase in 30-day mortality observed with stenting.\nTo our knowledge, this study is the fi  rst to evaluate the impact of hospital-level variables on therapeutic bronchoscopy outcomes. Prior studies of diagnostic bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound-transbronchial needle aspiration found that although little diff  erence exists among hospitals in terms of complication rates, there are significant differences in diagnostic yield, with higher-volume hospitals having higher diagnostic yields. 21,22  In the present study of therapeutic bronchoscopy, the average number of cases per month did not have a signifi  cant impact on complication rates. However, the number of centers and the number of patients enrolled from low-volume centers were low relative to the frequency of the events being studied (ie, complications). In addition, the center volumes per month refl  ected only the number of patients with malignant central airway obstruction. Complex therapeutic bronchoscopies for other indications, such as benign disease, were not considered, but the expertise developed from those procedures would probably be transferrable to malignant cases. Th erefore, these fi  ndings should be viewed as exploratory because this study lacks the power to reliably detect a relationship between center volume and incidence of complications.\nConsistent with prior studies, we found that low performance status was associated with increased 30-day mortality 1,13  and that high ASA scores were associated with more complications and increased health-care resource use. 1,32  Of note, not all prior studies of therapeutic bronchoscopy found a relationship between ASA scores and complications, but this may have been due to sample size limitations and the frequency of complications being relatively low. 12,33,34  In terms of health-care\n]\n(Continued)",

      "content": "resource use, higher ASA score was associated with a higher probability of escalation in the level of care postbronchoscopy. Escalation in level of care in the present study does not necessarily refl  ect harm per se because it did not require a clinical complication to be present. For example, observing a patient overnight aft  er an outpatient procedure would have been considered an escalation in level of care. Rather, escalation in level of care in this context is a measure of resource use. We found that 4.4% of patients required increased health-care resources in the short term following therapeutic bronchoscopy. Th is is similar to previous reports on Nd:YAG laser in which up to 21% of patients could not be immediately extubated and went to the ICU. 34  Th is is in contrast to other studies showing that therapeutic bronchoscopy allows deescalation in the level of care. 35  However, those studies focused solely on patients with airway obstruction and acute respiratory failure requiring admission to the ICU prior to bronchoscopy. In such instances, therapeutic bronchoscopy oft  en results in an immediate clinical improvement and deescalation in level of care, albeit perhaps not in the fi  rst 24 h; however, that is a very small subset of all patients receiving therapeutic bronchoscopy. Th e present study provides additional information by assessing the broader population of all patients undergoing therapeutic bronchoscopy for malignant airway obstruction. Th e data suggest that over the fi  rst 24 h, therapeutic bronchoscopy occasionally results in an increase in level of care required, although probably over the long term, quality of life and level of care required improve, consistent with previous studies. 12,35\nOther limitations inherent to the study design are the possibility of residual confounding and confounding by indication. For example, the association between APC use and bleeding is probably not causal, but rather it is a refl  ection of the fact that when bleeding occurs, an attempt to cauterize the lesion with APC is\noft  en made. As with all observational studies, the associations observed may not necessarily be causal. Another limitation is the use of composite outcomes, such as any complication, rather than looking at specifi  c types of complications, such as hypoxemia or bleeding. Th is can aff  ect the magnitude of the ORs observed and the inferences drawn because a risk factor for one type of complication (eg, hypoxemia) may not be a risk factor for another (eg, bleeding). To address this, we analyzed the data for each major type of complication and reported them separately. However, because complications are rare, it is possible that we failed to identify signifi  cant risk factors (ie, b -error) despite the relatively large sample size.\nIn conclusion, this multicenter registry study of therapeutic bronchoscopy for malignant central airway obstruction is the fi  rst to evaluate patient and hospital predictors of complications and adverse events. Complications were relatively rare, occurring in 3.9% of patients, with death occurring in 0.5%. Th ere were signifi  cant variations in how therapeutic bronchoscopy was performed. Of the risk factors identifi  ed, moderate sedation and stent use were variables most amenable to physician control. Physicians performing therapeutic bronchoscopy for malignant central airway obstruction should consider using general anesthesia rather than moderate sedation or should have general anesthesia readily available during the procedure. Stent placement was associated with increased 30-day mortality, and signifi  cant variation in stent use existed among centers. Although this could be due to residual confounding or confounding by indication, careful consideration about whether a stent is truly necessary if the airway lumen can be reopened to ≥ 50% without it is prudent  . Future studies should verify these fi  ndings and explore the impact of variations in stent strategy on patient outcomes.\n]",
