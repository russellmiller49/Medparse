      "content": "Fleischner Society 2017 1\nAn earlier incorrect version of this article appeared online. This article was corrected on March 13, 2017.\nOur recommendations are summarized in the Table. These are followed by  graded  ratings  of  each  recommendation  using  the  American  College  of Chest Physicians recommendations for  evidence  grading  in  clinical  guidelines  (9).  Additional  explanations  are provided  regarding  the  rationale  for each recommendation, which is based on  the  consensus  of  a  multidisciplinary  team  and  a  systematic  review  of the literature, further details of which are included in Appendix E1 [online]. The minimum threshold size for recommending follow-up is based on an estimated cancer risk in a nodule on the order of 1% or greater. This criterion is necessarily arbitrary, and we recognize that a higher threshold may be considered appropriate in some environments and  that  this  threshold  will  ultimately depend on social and economic factors. Several  general  considerations  regarding  technical  aspects  of  using  these recommendations  are  also  presented. Finally, in Appendix E1 (online), additional  information  regarding  methods and risk factors is given.\ndetected at CT in adult patients who are at  least  35  years  old.  Separate  guidelines  have  been  issued  for  lung  cancer screening, such as those from the American College of Radiology (ACR), and we support the use of those guidelines  when  interpreting  the  results  of CT screening  (8).  Specific  recommendations are provided for patients with multiple solid and subsolid nodules, and several  other  commonly  encountered clinical situations are addressed.\nThese  guidelines  are  not  intended for use in patients with known primary cancers  who  are  at  risk  for  metastases,  nor  are  they  intended  for  use  in immunocompromised patients who are  at  risk  for  infection;  in  these  patients,  treatment  should  be  based  on the specific clinical situation. Also, because  lung  cancer  is  rare  in  children and adults younger than 35 years, these guidelines are not appropriate for such patients.  When incidental nodules are encountered  in  young  patients,  management decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis, and the physician should recognize that infectious causes are  more  likely  than  cancer  and  that use of serial CT should be minimized. Most nodules smaller than 1 cm will not be  visible  on  chest  radiographs;  however,  for  larger  solid  nodules  that  are clearly  visualized  and  are  considered low  risk,  follow-up  with  radiography rather than CT may be appropriate to take  advantage  of  the  lower  cost  and lower radiation exposure.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1148/radiol.2017161659\nContent code:\nRadiology 2017; 284:228-243",

The purpose of these recommendations is to reduce the number of unnecessary follow-up examinations while providing greater discretion  to  the  radiologist,  clinician,  and patient to make management decisions. Thus,  a  range  of  times  rather  than  a specific interval for follow-up computed tomography (CT) is given for many scenarios. This change has been made in recognition of the multiple factors that determine risk and that cannot be easily incorporated into a summary table, as well as the important role of patient preference  for  either  more  aggressive or more conservative management. Although we have taken into account new data from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), Nederlans-Leuvens Longkanker  Screenings  Onderzoek  (NELSON), International Early Lung Cancer Action  Program  (iELCAP),  Pan-Canadian  Early  Detection  of  Lung  Cancer Study (PanCan), and British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA) cancer screening trials, all of which support the use of less aggressive management of small nodules,  we  recognize  that  screening programs have defined protocols to educate  candidates  about  potential  risks and the need for consistent monitoring, whereas incidentally identified nodules represent a separate population that requires a more varied approach to clinical management (3-7).\nThese  recommendations  refer  to incidentally  encountered  lung  nodules\n* Dimensions are average of long and short axes, rounded to the nearest millimeter.",

Coronal  and  sagittal  series  facilitate\nrecommend  adjusting  exposure  factors according to body habitus, with a goal of achieving a volumetric CT dose index (or CTDI vol ) of no more than 3 mGy in a standard-size patient (height, 170 cm; weight, 70 kg), as per ACR recommendations for screening CT (8).\nA number of dose reduction techniques, including dose modulation and iterative  reconstruction,  may  be  used (13). It is important that a similar technique be used to perform the follow-up examination to minimize interscan variability,  with  section thickness and reconstruction  filter  being  the  most  important parameters in this respect.\nFor  these  guidelines,  manual  nodule measurements should be based on the average of long- and short-axis diameters, both of which should be obtained  on  the  same  transverse,  coronal,  or  sagittal  reconstructed  images.

      "title": "Recommendations for Solid Lung Nodules",
      "content": "Recommendation 1: single solid noncalcified  nodules.Solid  nodules  smaller than  6  mm  (those  5  mm  or  smaller) do not require routine follow-up in patients at low risk (grade 1C; strong recommendation,  low-  or  very-low-quality evidence).  There  is  a  paucity  of  direct evidence  regarding  cancer  probability in small nodules in low-clinical-risk situations. However, there is abundant evidence for cancer risk in current smokers or those who recently quit smoking and who  have  been  studied  in  the  context of lung cancer screening programs. The risk of cancer in patients who have never  smoked  and  in  younger  patients is known to be significantly lower, with a  relative  risk  on  the  order  of  0.15  in the United States when compared with risk in heavy smokers in the case of solid nodules (21). Given that the average risk of cancer in solid nodules smaller than 6 mm in patients at high risk is less than 1%, it is reasonable to assume an even lower risk in a patient with low clinical risk  (7,22).  This  recommendation  is consistent  with  our  policy  of  excluding nodules with a less than 1% risk of cancer from routine CT follow-up.\nSolid nodules smaller than 6 mm do not require routine follow-up in all patients  with  high  clinical  risk;  however, some nodules smaller than 6 mm with suspicious morphology, upper lobe location, or both may warrant follow-up at 12 months (grade 2A; weak recommendation,  high-quality  evidence.).  These revised guidelines increase the size threshold for routine follow-up of solid nodules to 6 mm. This change is based on supporting data from several screening trials that indicate the risk of cancer in nodules smaller than 6 mm is considerably  less  than  1%,  even  in  patients at high risk (6,7). On the other hand,\nare not recommended, as their use implies a greater degree of accuracy than that which can be achieved in practice. Thus, the size threshold ( , 6 mm) corresponds to a rounded measurement of 5 mm or less in these guidelines. As an alternative  to  manual  linear  measurements,  automated  or  semiautomated volumetric measurements can be used, and  they  have  the  advantage  of  being more  reproducible  than  manual  techniques (17). Volume thresholds of 100 and  250  mm 3   are  used  for  volumetry instead of the 6- and 8-mm thresholds used  for  linear  measurements.  However, volumetry is substantially dependent on the specific software used (18,19).  For  this  reason,  volumetric measurements to assess nodule growth should be performed  with  identical software  versions.  More  comprehensive recommendations on nodule measurements, including a full discussion of technical and observer-related factors, will  be  provided  in  a  separate  White Paper from the Fleischner Society that is currently in preparation.\nPrior imaging studies should always be reviewed whenever they are available to determine possible growth or stability (grade 1A; strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). Comparisons\ndimensions is the image that should be used.  Measurements  should  be  made with  electronic  calipers  or  semiautomated methods and should be recorded to the nearest whole millimeter (grade 1C;  strong  recommendation,  low-  or very-low-quality evidence).\nAlthough  several screening trials have  used  the  maximum  diameter  of nodules on transverse sections to estimate size, others (iELCAP) have used the average of long- and short-axis diameters  measured  by  using  lung  windows (4,5,7,14,15). Prediction models used to estimate malignancy yield better  results  with  the  average  diameter than with  the  maximum  transverse diameter (16). The Fleischner Society has  recommended  use  of  the  average diameter since 2005, as the average of long and short axes more accurately reflects  three-dimensional  tumor  volume (1). For larger nodules and for masses larger than 10 mm, it is generally appropriate  to  record  both  long-  and short-axis  dimensions,  with  the  longaxis dimension being used to determine the T factor in lung cancer staging and being  a  criterion  for  tumor  response to treatment. Measurements  should be  rounded  to  the  nearest  millimeter. Fractional millimeter measurements\nb\ndiscontinuing  follow-up  of  well-defined solid  nodules  with  benign  morphology at  12-18  months  if  the  nodule  is  accurately measurable and unequivocally stable.  For  subsolid  nodules,  longerterm follow-up is recommended (2).\nFor  solitary  solid  noncalcified  nodules  measuring  6-8  mm  in  patients  at high  risk,  an  initial  follow-up  examination  is  recommended  at  6-12  months and again at 18-24 months (grade 1B: strong recommendation, moderate quality  evidence).  This  recommendation  is based on an estimated average risk of malignancy of approximately 0.5%2.0% for nodules in this size range and is derived from screening studies, most notably  the  PanCan,  BCCA,  and  NELSON trials (6,7) Again, the precise intervals can be modified according to individual risk factors and preferences. In some patients in whom nodule stability remains  uncertain,  further  surveillance may be required; however, two follow-up examinations should be sufficient to exclude growth in most subjects.\nFor solitary solid noncalcified nodules larger than 8 mm in diameter, consider 3-month follow-up, work-up with combined positron emission tomography (PET) and CT (PET/CT), tissue sampling,  or  a  combination  thereof; any one of these options may be appropriate depending on size, morphology, comorbidity, and other factors. (grade 1A; strong recommendation, high-quality evidence). Although the average risk of  cancer  in  an  8-mm  solitary  nodule is  only  approximately  3%  depending on morphology and location, a considerably  higher  risk  can  be  inferred  in certain patients (25,26). As nodules become larger, their morphology becomes more distinct, and management should be  strongly  influenced  by  the  appearance of the nodule rather than by size alone  (Figs  5-7).  Thus,  both  invasive and  noninvasive  management  options are included in this article.\nMeasurement of attenuation (in Hounsfield  units)  in  solid  nodules  can be  helpful  to  determine  the  presence of  calcification  or  fat,  either  of  which can have major diagnostic implications.  It  is  critical  that  such  measurements be made on images without an\nsuspicious  morphology,  upper  lobe  location,  or  both  can  increase  cancer risk into the 1%-5% range; therefore, follow-up at 12 months may be considered,  depending  on  comorbidity  and patient preferences. Earlier follow-up is not recommended in such instances, as experience has shown that such small nodules, if malignant, rarely advance in stage over 12 months, whereas a shortterm follow-up examination showing no apparent change may provide false reassurance. An exception may be made in  some  patients  with  technically  suboptimal  initial  scanning  results  to  obtain a high-quality baseline study for future comparison or in nervous patients who may be reassured by evidence of short-term stability.\nSolitary  noncalcified  solid  nodules measuring 6-8 mm in patients with low clinical  risk  are  recommended  to  undergo initial follow-up at 6-12 months depending on size, morphology, and patient preference ( grade 1C: strong recommendation, low- or very-low-quality evidence).  One  follow-up  examination should  suffice  in  many  instances.  If morphology is suspicious or if stability is uncertain, an additional study may be obtained after a further 6-12 months. The risk  of  malignancy  is  very  low  in this category, and not all solid nodules require traditional 2-year follow-up. The recommendation  for  2-year  follow-up was based on earlier studies with thick CT sections  or  chest  radiographs  and was made before the important differences between solid and subsolid nodules were recognized (6,7).\nAlthough  some  solid  cancers  have been  reported  to  grow  very  slowly, with doubling times of more than 700 days and failure to clearly demonstrate growth for up to 2 years, these reports were also based on analysis of thickersection  CT  images  and  evaluation  on hard-copy  images  (23).  More  recent studies have confirmed the reliability of 2-year stability in the assessment of benignancy in solid nodules, and shorter or longer periods of follow-up may be appropriate  in  selected  subjects,  depending  on  risk  factors,  nodule  morphology, and accuracy of measurements (24).  Thus,  we  recommend  optionally\nedge-enhancing filter, such as the type that is generally used on lung and bone images. Measurements on a sharpened image may give erroneously high attenuation  values,  and  other  factors,  such as beam hardening, can affect the accuracy of the measurements. All attenuation  measurements should be made on the thinnest available nonsharpened (typically soft-tissue window) image series;  the  radiologist  should  use  a small  region  of  interest  (not  a  point\nNote that this recommendation assumes no known or suspected primary neoplasm  that  might  be  a  source  of metastases. In patients with clinical evidence of infection and in those who are immunocompromised,  active  infection should  be  considered,  and  short-term follow-up may be appropriate.\nFor multiple solid noncalcified nodules with at least one nodule 6 mm or larger in diameter, follow-up is recommended at approximately 3-6 months, followed  by  an  optional  second  scan at  18-24  months  that  will  depend  on estimated risk. (grade 1B; strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). If a larger or more suspicious nodule is present, it should be used as a  guide  to  management  according  to the  guidelines  for  solitary  nodules,  as stated  previously.  In  such  situations, metastases remain a leading consideration, particularly when the distribution of nodules has peripheral and/or lower zone predominance and when the size of the nodules has a wide range (Fig 8) (28). In most instances, metastases will grow perceptibly within 3 months. An analysis of subjects with multiple nodules  in  the  NELSON  trial  showed  an increase in risk for primary cancer, as the  total  nodule  count  increased  from 1 to 4, but a decrease in risk for those with  five  or  more  nodules,  most  of which likely resulted from prior granulomatous infection (29).\nThe  dominant  nodule  should  be used as a guide to management; however, additional nodules should also be monitored on follow-up images. In this context,  the  term dominant refers  to the most suspicious nodule, which may not be the largest.",

The  previous  recommendation  of  initial  follow-up  at  3  months (2)  has  been  changed  to  follow-up  at 6-12 months because earlier follow-up is unlikely  to  affect  the  outcome  of  these characteristically indolent lesions.\nTo  date,  numerous  reports  have shown that pure ground-glass nodules that  are  6  mm  or  larger  may  be  followed  safely  for  5  years,  with  an  average  of  3-4  years  typically  required to establish growth or, less commonly, to diagnose a developing invasive carcinoma (Figs 9, 10) (30-34).\nthis does not preclude follow-up in selected  patients  with  subsolid  nodules (including those with pure ground-glass or  part-solid  types)  close  to  6  mm  in\nsize with suspicious  morphology  or other risk factors. This item has been modified slightly from the previous recommendation,  providing  an  option\nb\nb\na median time of 25 months. These all proved  to  be  stage  1  lesions,  with  an overall survival rate of 100%.\nAlthough  these  reports  represent strong evidence for a conservative approach  to  pure  ground-glass  lesions, initial  follow-up  at  6  months  is  still recommended, particularly in those nodules  with  features  reported  to  be risk factors for progression. These include  larger  lesion  size,  especially  diameter greater than 10 mm (7,35-38), and  the  presence  of  bubbly  lucencies (35,37,39,40).\nOf  particular  concern  are  patients who are uncomfortable with the prospect of waiting 12 months for follow-up examinations.  In  this  setting,  sooner follow-up  may  be  warranted,  as  many of  these  lesions  will  either  resolve  or show no change, thereby reassuring the patient (Fig 11) (3,36,41,42). Again, we would emphasize that these guidelines are  not  intended  to  preclude  either shorter or longer term follow-up in individual  subjects,  when  deemed  clinically appropriate (43).\nRecommendation  4:  solitary  partsolid  lung  nodules.For  solitary  partsolid nodules smaller than 6 mm, no routine  follow-up  is  recommended  (grade 1C;  strong  recommendation,  low-  or very-low-quality  evidence).  In  practice, discrete  solid  components  cannot  be reliably  defined  in  such  small  nodules, and they should be treated similar to the way in which pure ground-glass lesions of equivalent size are treated (see Recommendation  3,  which  was  described previously).\nFor solitary part-solid nodules 6 mm or larger  with  a  solid  component less than 6 mm in diameter, follow-up is recommended at 3-6 months and then annually for a minimum of 5 years. Although  part-solid  nodules  have  a  high likelihood of malignancy, nodules with a solid component smaller than 6 mm typically  represent  either  adenocarcinoma in  situ  or  minimally  invasive  adenocarcinoma  rather  than  invasive  adenocarcinoma (42,43). Additionally, part-solid nodules may be due to transient infections and may resolve after short-term follow-up  (Fig  12)  (44).  Thus,  at  least one  follow-up  scan  (3-6  months)  is\nidentified among 57  496 baseline studies. From these, a total of 73 lesions subsequently  proved  to  be  adenocarcinomas. Overall median time to treatment was 19 months, with solid components developing in 19 (26%) malignant nodules within",

In these guidelines, nodules are further divided into solid, ground-glass, and part-solid categories. However, the criteria  for  making  these  distinctions have not been completely agreed upon and remain controversial. Van Riel et al (59)  examined  the  agreement  between experienced  thoracic  radiologists  using traditional  subjective  criteria  to  assign nodules to solid, pure ground-glass, and part-solid categories. Both inter- and intraobserver agreement was found to be highly variable in these nodules. Correct classification of nodules as solid or subsolid by all radiologists was achieved in only 58% of cases (59). Nonetheless, it is generally agreed that nodules that are rendered partially invisible when viewed on thin sections with mediastinal (softtissue) window settings and a sharp filter can be regarded as subsolid and that any nodule components other than normal vascular or bronchial structures that remain visible on such images are solid. Small  solid  or  semisolid  components that represent early signs of invasive adenocarcinoma may be rendered invisible",

The recommended end point of 5 years is necessarily somewhat arbitrary, but it is considered reasonable for  patients  in  whom  the  dimensions and  attenuation  of  a  part-solid  nodule have remained unequivocally stable over that time period (42).\nFor solitary part-solid nodules with a  solid  component  6  mm  or  larger,  a short-term  follow-up  CT  scan  at  3-6 months  should  be  considered  to  evaluate for persistence of the nodule. For nodules with particularly suspicious morphology  (ie,  lobulated  margins  or cystic  components),  a  growing  solid component, or a solid component larger than 8 mm, PET/CT, biopsy, or resection are recommended (grade 1B; strong recommendation, moderatequality  evidence.)  Abundant  evidence enables  us  to  confirm  that  the  larger the  solid  component,  the  greater  the risk  of  invasiveness  and  metastases. A  solid  component  larger  than  5  mm correlates with a substantial likelihood of local invasion (7,43,45-54), and this is  a  threshold  criterion  in  the  newly\nrevised  T  factor  staging  for  adenocarcinoma  (Fig  13)  (55-57).  However,  a large solid component can also be seen in transient part-solid nodules (44,58).\nRecommendation  5:  multiple  subsolid  lung  nodules.In  patients  with multiple subsolid nodules smaller than 6  mm,  one  must  consider  infectious causes. If lesions remain  persistent after  an  initial  follow-up  scan  at  3-6 months, consider follow-up at approximately  2  and  4  years  to  confirm  stability, depending on the clinical setting (grade 1C; strong recommendation, low- or very-low-quality evidence). For multiple subsolid nodules, including pure  ground-glass  and  part-solid  morphologies smaller than 6 mm, short-term (3-6-month)  follow-up  may  be  appropriate  when  the  diagnosis  is  uncertain and  the  differential  diagnosis  includes nonneoplastic causes. If stability is established in this time frame, follow-up examinations  at  2  and  4  years  are recommended  to  confirm  absence  of growth, given the likelihood of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia or adenocarcinoma in situ in such instances (34).\nIn  patients  with  multiple  subsolid  nodules  with  at  least  one  nodule that is  6  mm or larger, management\nb\nmake a recommendation for follow-up. Although linear measurement with electronic calipers remains the current standard  of  practice,  experience  with semiautomated  nodule  volumetry  suggests  that  this  approach  has  superior sensitivity  in  the  detection  of  nodule growth  (22,64,65).  While  robust  and validated software for volumetric nodule measurement is not widely used at present, we anticipate that it will have an increased role in the future.\nVolume  doubling  times  for  solid cancers  are  well  established  (one  volume  doubling  corresponds  to  a  26% increase in diameter), with a large majority of times being in the 100-400-day range. For subsolid cancerous nodules, which represent primary adenocarcinomas,  more  indolent  growth  is  the rule,  with  average  doubling  times  on the order of 3-5 years (34,66). For this reason,  longer  initial  follow-up  intervals and longer total follow-up periods are recommended for subsolid nodules than for solid nodules.",

The association between adenocarcinoma, which accounts for virtually all subsolid lung cancers, and smoking is weaker than the association between small cell or squamous cell carcinomas and smoking, and the incidence of adenocarcinoma in nonsmokers is increasing, with female nonsmokers being affected  significantly  more  often  than male nonsmokers (75,77). However, the degree to which smoking affects the risk for  lung  adenocarcinoma has not been clearly defined; thus, our recommendations for management of subsolid nodules are independent of customary risk categories (78).\nA smoking history of 30 pack-years or  more  and  quitting  smoking  within the past 15 years have been used as the qualifying  tobacco  exposure  threshold for  the  NLST  screening  program,  and they should be considered indicative of high-risk  status  in  patients  with  solid nodules.

For each additional  decade  of  life,  lung  cancer  incidence increases steadily (71,72). The possible role of sex as a risk factor for lung cancer has been explored in several recent studies. Chiles et al (69) identified certain individual characteristics of female subjects in the NLST trial, such as  lower  educational  level  and  lower body mass index, that were associated with an increased risk of cancer; however,  the  overall  6-year  risk  of  cancer was not significantly different from that in  male  subjects.  Boiselle  (73)  examined  the  relative  risk  for  women  and men in the same trial with solid, nonsolid, or part-solid nodules and found a significantly higher risk in women with ground-glass (nonsolid) nodules. Female sex was also found to be a risk factor in the  PanCan  trial,  with  an  overall  odds ratio of 1.8; however, the relationship to nodule type was not reported (7).
