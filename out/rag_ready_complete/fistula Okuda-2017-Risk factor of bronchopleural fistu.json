      "title": "Introduction",
      "content": "Bronchopleural fistula (BPF) is a rare but severe complication that can occur after anatomical lung resection. It exposes the clean pleural space to endobronchial bacterial flora, and the resulting pleural effusion can leak into the major airway and spread to the peripheral alveolar space. This situation causes severe aspiration pneumonia and/or empyema, which can be potentially fatal; in fact, the mortality rate for BPF after pneumonectomy is reported to be 18-50% [1-3].\nBPF after general thoracic surgery requires emergency treatment, because affected patients usually have poor shortterm respiratory function as a result of lung volume loss and/or surgical damage to the respiratory muscles. Recovery from early BPF symptoms is very much dependent on the urgent application of appropriate therapies.\nTraditionally, a right-side pneumonectomy and right lower lobectomy are known to be associated with a high risk of BPF [2, 4], which is suspected to occur as a result of a decreased post-operative blood supply to the bronchial stump after lymph node dissection and preoperative therapies [3, 5-7]. Although the procedure used to suture the bronchial stump has been discussed as a risk factor for BPF, it is now considered that manual suturing and mechanical stapling are not significantly different [8].",

      "content": "All recent literature published between 2006 and 2016 and pertaining to early BPF after anatomical lung resection in adults, including information about risk factors, was reviewed. Our search was performed through Medline (PubMed: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/PubMed) using the search keywords 'bronchopleural fistula,' 'risk factor,' and 'lung resection.' Papers describing radiofrequency ablation, microwave coagulation therapy, children or infants, and chronic BPF or with contents considered by the authors to be insufficient were excluded. In addition, references included in the collected literature and published during the same period were included, if appropriate.\nEarly BPF was defined as BPF occurring within 30 days from surgery or described as 'early' in the literature.\nOur institutional data were collected and analyzed for comparison as described below. The study candidates were 1114 consecutive Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who had been undergone an anatomical lung resection between April 1999 and August 2015 at the Kagawa University Hospital. Risk factors (sex, age, past medical history, preoperative therapy, tumor location, histology, procedure, and reinforcement) were evaluated. Dichotomous variables were compared using the Fisher's exact test and categorical variables were compared using the Chi-squared test; continuous variables were compared using an unpaired Student's t test. Differences were considered significant at p <  0.05. Risk factors were analyzed using the logistic regression model. Factors shown to be significant using a univariate analysis at p <  0.2 were included in the multivariate analysis, in which independent prognostic factors were considered significant at p <  0.05. The results of our data are shown in Tables 1, 2, and 3.",

      "content": "Original articles among the collected literature are listed in Table 4 [9-15]. Not all studies were included in the multivariate analysis. The reported risk factors for BPF included microscopically evident residual tumor, patient\nage,  respiratory  complications,  procedure  employed (pneumonectomy), preoperative therapy, previous medical history (diabetes mellitus), and acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia. Among studies of pneumonectomy, the completion of the pneumonectomy, neoadjuvant therapy, a patient age of over 70 years, diabetes mellitus, and the right side were described as significant risk factors. Studies of meta-analyses, reported mainly by Li et al. [1, 16-19], revealed that risk factors for BPF were residual tumor at the bronchial stump, use of neoadjuvant radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy, and previous medical history (diabetes mellitus and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease).\nAnalyses of the risk factors at our institution are summarized in Table 2 (all cases, multivariate analysis) and Table 3 (lobectomy case and pneumonectomy case, multivariate analysis).\nA male gender as a risk factor of BPF was not comparatively important, as its significance was shown in a univariate analysis [12] but not in a multivariate analysis [Table 2]. Patient age, however, was a considerable risk factor for BPF. In Japan, although not all patients underwent an anatomical lung resection, 85% of the surgically resected Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients were over 60 years old, and 53% were over 70 years old [7]. This result implied that surgery for Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in Japan carries a potential risk of BPF.\nA residual bronchial stump, as pointed out by Kawaguchi et al. [9], was a unique factor. Tumor regression or wound healing might contribute to BPF, and Kawaguchi et al. reported that a direct extension type, but not carcinoma in situ, was associated with BPF. A meta-analysis performed by Li [16] concluded a significant risk only for pneumonectomy.\nNeoadjuvant therapy for Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was the most notable risk factor for BPF, with several reports concluding the existence of a significant risk of BPF [11, 14, 17]. Chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery might potentially disturb bronchial wound healing.\nA past medical history, especially of diabetes mellitus, is a controversial risk factor. Hu et al. [14] and a meta-analysis [18] concluded the presence of a significant risk of BPF; however, the definition and degree of diabetes mellitus were not described, similar to our results. The presence of controlled or uncontrolled disease may be more important.\nRespiratory complications like pneumonia or the acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia have been pointed out as risk factors of BPF [10, 15]. However, neither of these articles described an association between BPF formation and respiratory complications. Severe respiratory complications usually demand respirator ventilation, steroid pulse therapy, and numerous drug treatments. These situations occurring soon after anatomical lung resection may contribute to BPF formation. Aspiration pneumonia after anatomical lung\nresection, especially a right lower lobectomy, is a notable complication.\nThe diameter or thickness of the bronchial stump after a pneumonectomy is wider or thicker than those after a lobectomy. An analysis of the risk factors for BPF associated with both a lobectomy and a pneumonectomy tended to conclude that a pneumonectomy itself was a significant risk [10, 12]. Regarding BPF after anatomical lung resection, a pneumonectomy appeared to represent a situation that differed from a lobectomy; therefore, we analyzed the risk factors for BPF for each situation separately.",

      "title": "Lobectomy",
      "content": "A lobectomy is the surgical procedure used most frequently for the resection of bronchopulmonary carcinoma in Japan (27,584 cases, representing 72% of all lung cancer cases\nin 2014 [20]). BPF after lobectomy occurs in intermediate (right lower or right middle-lower lobectomy) or smallcaliber bronchi (other lobectomy). Although a decrease in blood supply to the bronchial stump or damage to the bronchial stump (surgical procedure, electrical burn, destruction due to local infection, etc.) has been discussed as possibly causes of BPF [3, 5-7], no definitive conclusion has yet been reached.\nAmong lobectomy procedures, a right lower lobectomy and a right middle-lower bilobectomy have been considered to pose a significant risk. In addition, neoadjuvant therapy, especially radiation intervention, has been  reported  as  a  significant  risk  factor.  Takahashi et  al.  reported  dose-histogram  parameters  (irradiated lung volume ratio expressed percentage over 35 grays [V35g > 19%] and 40 grays [V40g > 16%]) for neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in relation to BPF [21].

Further research on risk factors for BPF after a lobectomy is needed.

In 2014, a total of 521 pneumonectomies were performed as radical procedures for Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in Japan [20]. Right-side and complete pneumonectomy were associated with a high risk of BPF [12, 13], and neoadjuvant therapy, especially radiation therapy, was also a significant risk factor [14].\nMore articles have discussed the risk factors for BPF after a pneumonectomy, compared with articles regarding a lobectomy only. A complete pneumonectomy, which is one of the most invasive and dangerous surgical procedures performed in general thoracic surgery, was shown to be associated with a significant risk of BPF in a recent paper [13]. Our data concluded that a complete pneumonectomy and the right side were significant risk factors (Table 3).",

      "title": "Reinforcement",
      "content": "Although the prevention of BPF is an important issue, no rigorous procedures have been specifically recommended. Experience has shown that reinforcement of the stump and preservation of some of the bronchial blood supply at the time of lymph node dissection are important for preventing BPF.\nReinforcement of the bronchial stump is considered a common preventative measure for BPF, and many thoracic surgeons perform this step after anatomical lung resection despite a lack of evidence of any benefit. The most common materials used to reinforce the bronchial stump are adipose tissue and muscle. Adipose tissue is often derived from pedicled or free pericardial fat that can be easily harvested at the time of thoracic surgery [22, 23]. The omentum is considered to be the most effective material for preventing thoracic leakage, but a laparotomy or laparoscopy is needed to harvest this tissue [24, 25]. Intercostal muscle is usually used for muscle reinforcement of the bronchial stump. The use of an intercostal muscle flap at the time of thoracic surgery has the advantage of easy access and a convenient length [1, 26]. Other thoracic muscles, such as the latissimus dorsi, serratus anterior, and pectoralis major, are also candidates for reinforcement materials. However, muscles always shorten if they are not used for contraction and become lax. On the other hand, adipose tissue hardly degenerates over a long period, irrespective of whether it is used as a free or a pedicled flap. When a muscle flap is selected as the bronchial coverage material, atrophic shrinkage must be considered when determining the length to harvest; otherwise, unnecessary tension will build up at the bronchial stump (Fig. 1).\nOdds ratio (OR) odds  ratio, 95%  CI 95%  confidence  interval, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, NACRT neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy\nRelative risk (RR) odds  ratio, 95%  CI 95%  confidence  interval, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, NACRT neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy",

      "title": "Comment",
      "content": "Many papers have described BPF as a severe and critical complication occurring after anatomical lung resection [2, 3, 27], with a reported incidence of about 0.6-4.4% [3, 4, 10, 12, 15, 20, 27] and a very high mortality rate (18-50% [2]). Various risk factors for BPF after anatomical lung resection have been reported. Two decades previously, right-side surgery, the pneumonectomy procedure employed, and neoadjuvant therapy were considered major risk factors [3, 4, 26], and recent studies have mostly reached the same conclusions. Recently, there has been an increased focus on radiation intervention in studies of neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery in relation to BPF [12, 21]. In a study of chemotherapy, Uramoto\net al. reported that only neoadjuvant therapy did not pose a significant risk [12].\nIn comparison with only a decade previously, various treatments have been developed for lung cancer. Molecular targeted therapies such as new-generation EGFR-TKI, ALK-inhibitors, immune-checkpoint inhibitors, or vascular epithelial growth factor agents did not exist in Japan in the early 2000s. The effectiveness of these new therapies, such as neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery, remains inconclusive in relation to the risk of BPF. Salvage strategies for advanced non-small cell lung cancer have been frequently analyzed in recent studies [28, 29]. Salvage surgery is defined as surgery for residual tumors after definitive therapy for systemic advanced non-small cell lung cancer or surgery for relapsed lesions after a clinical complete\nROS retrospective observational study, NA not available, BPF bronchopleural fistula a\nResult only early BPF\nresponse has been obtained using the previous therapies. The Japan Guidelines for Lung Cancer Therapy [30] state that agents should be selected according to the histologic type of the tumor and some biomarkers at an unresectable advanced stage. Treatments for advanced stage Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can be selected from cytotoxic agents, EGFR-TKI, ALK inhibitor, immune-check point inhibitor, and endothelial growth factor inhibitor, for which adverse events include the development of fistulas. Therefore, strategies for salvage surgery after the use of newer systemic therapies may reveal other risk factors for BPF after anatomical lung resection.\nAs many thoracic surgeons tend to cover the bronchial stump in high-risk cases, a retrospective analysis of the effectiveness of bronchial reinforcement will almost certainly involve a collection bias. In a prospective study of pneumonectomy in patients with diabetes mellitus, Sfyridis et al. [26] reported that intercostal muscle flap coverage was significantly effective, and no BPF event occurred in the reinforcement arm. The low incidence of BPF was described as a limitation.\nDiMagio et al. have reported that bronchial reinforcement is not significantly effective for the prevention of BPF [1], nor does it pose a risk of BPF. Our study reached the same results (Tables 2, 3). If, on ethical grounds, most thoracic surgeons perform reinforcement in high-risk cases, a prospective or randomized study of the effectiveness of reinforcement would be unnecessary, since no studies would likely investigate the disadvantages of bronchial reinforcement. Closer attention to cases with a high risk of BPF and urgent intervention when BPF occurs are considered more important issues.\nIn conclusion, BPF is one of the severest complications after general thoracic surgery, and no effective prophylactic procedure is available. Reinforcement of the bronchial stump may help to prevent BPF, but proof of its effectiveness is a difficult issue both ethically and experientially. Because reinforcement seems to pose no hazard at present, we do not discourage its use. An ongoing risk analysis of BPF will be necessary as therapeutic technologies related to general thoracic surgery continue to evolve.",
