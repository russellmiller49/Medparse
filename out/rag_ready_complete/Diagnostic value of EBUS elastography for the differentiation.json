In recent studies, EBUSTBNA has been shown to have a superior diagnostic yield than conventional TBNA, and has a diagnostic accuracy comparable to mediastinoscopy in intrathoracic LN evaluation. 2 -4 However, during the procedure physicians usually encounter various LNs detected by Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS). Prediction of the nature of pathological LNs before puncture may help physicians select suspicious LNs to obtain tissue for diagnosis without excessive passes.\nSonographic features are useful for the differentiation of benign and malignant intrathoracic LNs. 5,6 Adding power/colour Doppler-mode image analysis to Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) Bmode to examine the vascular patterns of LNs helps improve the accuracy of differentiation. 6,7 Although some sonographic and vascular patterns are present in malignant rather than benign LNs, a combination of\nCorrespondence: Viboon Boonsarngsuk, Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Rama VI Road, Phyathai, Bangkok 10400, Thailand.

      "content": "Endobronchial ultrasound elastography has been introduced as a complementary modality in benign/ malignant differentiation of intrathoracic lymphadenopathy. We found that a strain ratio of >2.5 and non-type 1 elastographic pattern achieved similar high diagnostic performance in benign/malignant differentiation. It can be useful for targeting a suspicious lymph node for sampling.\nthese /uniFB01 ndings are needed to help precise differentiation between the two. Wang et al . 6 reported that at least two of the four sonographic and vascular patterns (round shape, presence of matting, absence of central hilar structure and non-hilar vascular pattern perfusion) could achieve the best diagnostic performance for predicting metastatic LNs with sensitivity, speci /uniFB01 city, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and diagnostic accuracy of 93.03%, 55.68%, 84.55%, 75.38% and 82.68%, respectively.\nUltrasound elastography is a new imaging method used for measurement of tissue elasticity. The method reveals the physical properties of the tissue by characterizing the difference of hardness between pathological tissue and normal tissue in response to compression or vibration. 8,9 Data can then be converted into an RGB (red, green and blue) colour image where hard tissue is shown in blue, medium tissue in green and soft tissue in red, overlaid on the B-mode image. On the basis of pathophysiology that malignancy causes tissue to be harder than adjacent normal tissue, ultrasound elastography can be used for benign/ malignant differentiation in several organs such as breast, thyroid, prostate, cervix, liver, pancreas and extrathoracic LNs. 10 Recently, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography has been introduced as a complementary modality in the evaluation of intrathoracic lymphadenopathy. At present, data regarding the use of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography for the differentiation of benign and malignant intrathoracic LNs remain limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of elastography to differentiate between benign and malignant LNs in patients undergoing Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) for investigation of enlarged intrathoracic LNs. In addition, both qualitative and quantitative Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography were compared.",

      "content": "A prospective study was conducted at Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, and Rajavithi Hospital, Rangsit University, Thailand from July 2015 to July 2016 on patients ≥ 15 years of age who were sent for evaluation of enlarged intrathoracic LNs demonstrated on computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest. Only accessible LNs identi /uniFB01 ed by Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA were\nincluded. Short axis diameter of the target node was recorded. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients before commencement of the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA procedure. The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Review Committee, Institutional Review Board of Rajavithi Hospital (ID 084-2558) and the Ethics Committee on Human Experimentation of Ramathibodi Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Mahidol University (ID 06-58-16).\nAll Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) procedures were performed via the oral route under local anaesthesia (lidocaine) and conscious sedation (pethidine) by P.K. or V.B. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) was performed using a real-time convex probe Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) (BFUC180F; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) linked to a processor (EU-ME2 Premier Plus; Olympus) with a frequency of 10 MHz. The target LNs detected by CT scan were initially identi /uniFB01 ed by conventional B-mode Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and then elastography was performed. LNs were classi /uniFB01 ed qualitatively according to the dominant elastographic colour pattern: type 1, predominantly non-blue; type 2, partly blue, partly non-blue and type 3, predominantly blue (Fig. 1). 11 In cases where multiple LNs were detected, bizarre, large and easy-to-sample LNs were selected for further examination. To assess interobserver agreement in qualitative colour elastography, still images of all selected LNs undergoing elastography were captured and reviewed independently by the operator not present at the initial procedure (P.K. or V.B.).\nQuantitative elastography of selected LNs was performed by measurement of the strain ratio (SR). The largest possible area within the LN was outlined (circle) as A, while the area of the surrounding tissue was outlined as B, as a reference. The strain (B/A) ratio was calculated automatically by the ultrasound unit (Fig. 2). 12 The SR for each LN was measured three times and the median value used for analysis. Then, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was performed with a dedicated 22-gauge cytology TBNA (NA-201SX-4022; Olympus) on selected LNs. Samples from each LN were submitted for cytopathology and analysed separately.\nThe diagnosis from Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was established as the cytopathological report. The cytopathological diagnosis of nonspeci /uniFB01 c lymphadenopathy was considered to be nondiagnostic even if the /uniFB01 nal diagnosis proved to be a benign process. If the de /uniFB01 nite diagnosis was not\nreached by Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, the patient then underwent video-assisted thoracoscopy or clinical and radiological follow-up to con /uniFB01 rm the underlying cause of the lymphadenopathy.",

The mean LN size was 18.8 /C6 7.9 mm, 96 were malignant and 24 benign. The baseline characteristics of the patients and target LNs are given in Table S1 (Supplementary Information).\nCytopathology of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA samples provided a de /uniFB01 nite diagnosis in 103 LNs (85.8%). For 17 patients whose Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA cytopathological results were\nnon-diagnostic, the /uniFB01 nal diagnoses were 5 malignant and 12 benign causes of the lymphadenopathy. One malignancy was de /uniFB01 nitively diagnosed by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Non-small cell lung cancer (Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)) was diagnosed by transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) in three patients and by transthoracic needle aspiration (TTNA) in one patient. Regarding benign /uniFB01 nal diagnoses, /uniFB01 ve patients were diagnosed as tuberculosis (TB): established by VATS in two patients, positive TB culture from Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA rinse /uniFB02 uid in one and demonstrating caseous granuloma from TBLB samples and LN regression after administration of antituberculous drugs in two patients. Seven LNs were stable in size on follow-up CT scan at 6 months and were /uniFB01 nally concluded to be reactive LNs (Fig. S1, Supplementary Information).\nIn qualitative Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography interpretation, the kappa value to assess the interobserver variability was 0.88. There were no cases of disagreement in interpretation from type 1 to type 3 and vice versa. Table 1 shows the distribution of LNs according to qualitative Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography type and /uniFB01 nal diagnosis. All type 1 LNs were diagnosed as benign, while 94.1% of type 3 were malignant.\nMalignant LNs presented a higher median SR than benign LNs (73.50 (range: 2.93 -305.00) vs 1.29 (range: 0.03 -194.00), P < 0.001). The AUC for the SR was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.74 -0.97; Fig. S2, Supplementary Information). Using an ROC curve, the best cut-off SR for differentiation of benign and malignant LNs was 15.3. The cut-off SR of >2.5 provided sensitivity of 100% for predicting malignant LN. In comparing qualitative and quantitative Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography, non-type 1 elastographic pattern and SR of more than 2.5 and 15.3, respectively, achieved similar diagnostic performance in benign/malignant differentiation ( P = 0.77) (Table 2).\nAUC, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), endobronchial ultrasound; NPV, negative predictive value; PPV, positive predictive value; SR, strain ratio.\nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), endobronchial ultrasound; LN, lymph node.\nIn overall LNs, SR had no correlation with the LN size (r = 0.005; P = 0.954).

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "content": "Intrathoracic LNs were /uniFB01 rst evaluated using elastography during endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) via the oesophagus. Janssen et al . 13 reported that the diagnostic accuracy range in evaluation of posterior mediastinal LNs was 84.6 -86.4% for malignant LNs and 81.8 -87.9% for benign LNs. For nodal staging of oesophageal cancer, EUS elastography showed superior accuracy compared with conventional EUS criteria in differentiating benign and malignant LNs. 14\nUltrasound elastography has been integrated into convex probe Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS). To our knowledge, only /uniFB01 ve English-language publications have evaluated its usefulness in intrathoracic LN evaluation (Table 4). 11,15 -18 The characteristics of tissue elasticity can be measured either by the colour-based qualitative method or by a quantitative method. For the qualitative method, LNs are classi /uniFB01 ed according to the dominant elastographic colour patterns. Izumo et al . 11 demonstrated its accuracy in predicting type 1 (benign) and type 3 (malignant) LNs, but not type 2, similar to our results.\nOwing to subjective interpretations, three quantitative techniques have been developed to improve accuracy and minimize operator bias. The /uniFB01 rst is the strain histogram, which represents the mean strain value within a selected area. In the histogram graph, the x-axis represents the elasticity values (each value indicated by a pixel colour) from 0 to 255, where 0 is hardest and 255 is softest, and the y-axis represents the number of pixels of each value. 19 Unfortunately, data regarding the ef /uniFB01 cacy of this technique are limited. 15 The second method is the stiff area ratio. The operator must /uniFB01 rst de /uniFB01 ne the region of interest (ROI) that covers the largest possible area within the LN. Then, the stiff area ratio can be calculated by the blue-coloured (de /uniFB01 ned as hue 145 -180) pixel area divided by the LN pixel area in the\nROI. Nakajima et al . 16 demonstrated a cut-off stiff area ratio of 0.311 for predicting malignant LN. However, this method requires additional software and cannot be performed under real-time Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) procedure. The /uniFB01 nal technique is the SR, which is based on a comparison between two non-overlapping tissue areas; usually area A is the lesion, area B is the reference zone and the SR represents the B/A quotient. 19 As the present results indicate, the SR has shown ef /uniFB01 cacy in benign/malignant differentiation in previous studies. 17,18\nTo provide a de /uniFB01 nitive diagnosis of the cause of intrathoracic lymphadenopathy, a tissue diagnosis is usually required; however, multiple LNs are frequently discovered during both CT scan and Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) investigations. When malignancy is suspected pre-procedure, the most suspicious LN should be targeted for sampling. Benign/malignant differentiation is necessary for accurate LN staging of lung cancer, in this context LNs which are potentially involved in disease should be sampled, while benign-looking LNs might be avoided to reduce unnecessary LN punctures. After sampling, if a malignant tissue is not obtained, then the physician has to interpret whether this represents a true negative. Thus, the test should have high sensitivity and high NPV. Although there was a high sensitivity and NPV of nearly 90% at the cut-off SR used in previous reports, this still cannot preclude LN sampling and con /uniFB01 rm a true negative result. Therefore, we chose the cut-off SR of >2.5 to achieve sensitivity and NPV of 100%. Qualitative colour Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography of non-type 1 LNs also provided similar diagnostic results in prediction of malignancies.\nAlthough qualitative colour elastography is a subjective measurement, we found that interobserver agreement was excellent, with no cases of misinterpretation between type 1 and type 3. Elastography of type 2 LNs may be either benign or malignant; hence, aspiration should be carried out, focusing on the blue region. In contrast, we found that SR, which is a quantitative measurement, had intraobserver variability. Thus, each LN was measured three times and the median value was selected for analysis. The difference in ROI areas in both LN and the surrounding normal tissue has an in /uniFB02 uence on SR value. Nevertheless, with a low cut-off SR of 2.5, this variability does not result in misinterpretation when differentiating between benign and malignant nodes.\nThere were some limitations in our study. The indication for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) procedure in our study was to obtain an initial diagnosis, not for LN staging of lung cancer. Therefore, the results could be different when applied for LN staging, implying that further work on Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography for LN staging is still necessary. Second, the mean diameter of LNs in our study was relatively large, with a limited number of LNs that were <10 mm. Results may be different in small nodes that contain malignant deposits, and therefore Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography /uniFB01 ndings in early metastasis containing LNs that remain small in size is another issue that requires further investigation. Third, in cases of high likelihood of malignancy, only type 2 and 3 LNs were selected for sampling; hence, we might have missed the possibility of malignancy in type 1 LNs in such cases. Fourth, TB lymphadenitis was the cause of the majority of benign LNs in our study, which is re /uniFB02 ective of the prevalence of the disease in our population. Other causes of\nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), endobronchial ultrasound; LN, lymph node.\nbenign lymphadenopathy, such as sarcoidosis, should be examined by Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography colour pattern and SR to con /uniFB01 rm our /uniFB01 ndings. Finally, we did not compare the ef /uniFB01 cacy of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography with B-mode sonographic patterns. B-mode Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) was also performed in all patients before elastography, but we found that the interpretation was dif /uniFB01 cult, involving subjective judgment, and might be operator-dependent, while both colour and SR elastography were easier. Although the number of patients was limited, in studies by He et al . 17 and Rozman et al ., 18 SR elastography showed\nsuperior accuracy than B-mode Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) in differentiating benign and malignant LNs.\nIn conclusion, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography is a promising diagnostic modality for the differentiation of benign and malignant LNs during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA. Qualitative and quantitative Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) SR elastographies provide similar diagnostic performance. This technology can be useful for targeting a suspicious LN for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA sampling. However, more research is needed regarding other aspects, such as indication (diagnosis or staging), LN size (early metastasis), elastography /uniFB01 ndings in\ndifferent types of malignancy and comparison of different elastography techniques (colour, strain histogram, stiff area ratio and SR). In addition, standardization of ROI selection needs to be speci /uniFB01 ed to reduce intraobserver and interobserver variability.",
