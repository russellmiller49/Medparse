    "abstract": "Background: Endobronchial ultrasound-transbronchial needle aspiration (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA) is a useful technique for cytological assessment of enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes with a high diagnostic yield for lung cancer. However, the small sample volume can be problematic in diagnosing benign diseases and for molecular analysis of malignant tumours. Objectives: The aim of the study was to evaluate a novel lymph node forceps for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided lymph node biopsy (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-transbronchial forceps biopsy; Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBFB) in malignant and benign conditions concerning safety, feasibility, and diagnostic yield. Methods: Patients with enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes were included. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was performed followed by Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided TBFB with the lymph node forceps. Three biopsy specimens were obtained. The diagnostic yields of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBFB, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, and the combination of both sampling techniques were compared.

However, a shortcoming of this method is its low negative predictive value reported in some studies. Guidelines recommend confirmation of negative results by surgical procedures [5] . The diagnostic value of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA in the evaluation of mediastinal lymphadenopathy in conditions other than lung cancer is less clear. Its accuracy in establishing the correct histopathological diagnosis of lymphoma is lower than for lung cancer. Mediastinoscopy is frequently required in order to obtain sufficient tissue for critical treatment decisions [6, 7] . For sarcoidosis, some authors consider the diagnostic yield of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA good enough while others report inferior results and recommend more invasive tissue sampling procedures [3, 8, 9] . Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, therefore, has some limitations in the assessment of mediastinal lymphadenopathy. One plausible reason might be the small sample volume of tissue obtained by Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA performed with the 22-gauge needle. A histologic biopsy taken with a forceps may therefore have additional value. Some investigators have previously reported the use of biopsy forceps through the hole made by the TBNA needle for obtaining histologic material from enlarged subcarinal lymph nodes either blindly or under fluoroscopic or Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) guidance [10-13] . Recently, in a study in patients with unexplained mediastinal lymphadenopathy, an ultrasoundguided forceps yielded improved diagnostic results [14] . However, the described methods require considerable technical skill and bronchoscopic expertise. Furthermore, mainly subcarinal lymph nodes were assessed. In another study, a needle forceps was used without Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) guidance to sample subcarinal lymph nodes without first puncturing the tracheal wall with a standard TBNA needle. However, in this study, in 28% of cases, it was impossible to penetrate the wall with the needle forceps [15] . The aim of the present study was to develop an easyto-use dedicated two-in-one lymph node forceps for sampling from all Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) scope accessible mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes. The utility, safety, and diagnostic yield of this needle forceps were prospectively tested in a clinical trial. The challenge was to get an instrument that is small and sharp enough to penetrate the tracheobronchial wall but big enough to obtain a large volume specimen. The handpiece and the wires must be strong enough that the forceps can be opened and closed inside a lymph node without getting too big for the working channel of the bronchoscope. We tested various prototypes in excised pig lungs until eventually a company (MTW → Endoskopie, Wesel, Germany) provided us with a CE-marked model, suitable for clinical testing ( fig. 1 ). This specifically designed lymph node forceps is shaped like a needle in the closed position with a sharpened bevelled tip and housed in an outer sheath to prevent damage to the working channel of the bronchoscope. It is not possible to fix the instrument at the bronchoscope. Therefore, the bronchoscopist has to take care not to push the needle forceps forward before the sheath is visible outside the working channel. Once pushed out of the sheath, the needle forceps is sharp enough to omit previous perforation of the bronchial wall with a 19-gauge needle",

TBFB was obtained only from the index lymph node, because performing TBFB in all enlarged lymph nodes would have extended the examination time too much. The size of this index lymph node was divided into 3 groups according to its short axis diameter (10-20 mm, 21-30 mm, and 31 mm and greater). When appropriate, colour Doppler ultrasound mode was used to exclude vessels in the target area. The jabbing method of TBNA was used for penetrating the bronchial wall and puncturing the target lymph node   [16]  . With the forceps close to the orifice, the working channel of the bronchoscope helped to stabilise the device and facilitated tissue penetration. Once inside the lymph node, the forceps was opened and moved slightly back and forth to achieve complete opening against tissue resistance. Finally, the lymph node forceps was advanced slightly, closed, withdrawn, and retracted into the outer sheath. All of the above steps were performed under ultrasound guidance (  fig. 2  ). Three specimens were obtained. Patients were observed for 2 h after the procedure and a chest X-ray was performed to exclude pneumothorax or other procedure-related adverse effects.",

Seven patients were excluded from the analysis as they withdrew consent to invasive procedures or follow-up (  fig. 4  ). The mean age of the 48 patients enrolled per protocol was 54 years (range 19-79). There were 26 males and 22 females within the cohort. The  respective  index  lymph  nodes  chosen  for  EBUSTBFB by the endoscopist were located most often in the subcarinal (station 7) or right hilar (station 11R) region. In the majority of cases, the size of the index lymph node\ndid not exceed 20 mm (  table 1  ). The bronchial wall was successfully penetrated by the lymph node forceps in all cases. Three tissue specimens were obtained from all but one lymph node, in which only 2 samples were taken. Adequate histologic specimens were obtained from all patients  except  the  first  patient  recruited  into  the  study. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA revealed features compatible with a diagnosis of sarcoidosis in this patient.\nIn 32 patients (67%), a classifying diagnosis was made with Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBFB alone (  table 1  ). The pathologic analysis revealed Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in 12 cases. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and a relapse of oesophageal cancer were diagnosed in 2 and 1 patient, respectively. Sixteen patients had a granulomatous  inflammatory  reaction  and,  considering  the clinical phenotype, sarcoidosis was the final diagnosis. In 1 patient, caseating granulomas and a positive polymerase chain reaction for M. tuberculosis complex confirmed tuberculosis.\nIn 16 patients, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBFB did not provide a classifying diagnosis. Sarcoidosis and large cell lung carcinoma was diagnosed by the result of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA in 1 patient, respectively. The remaining patients underwent further examination by surgical means (11 patients) or follow-up CT (3 patients) (  fig. 4  ). This revealed Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in 3 cases, anthracosilicosis in 2, and Castleman's disease, bronchogenic cyst, and sarcoidosis in 1 patient, respectively.

Lung  cancer  (Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  and  SCLC) was diagnosed correctly by Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA in 15 of 18 patients (83%). The only patient with lymphoma (Castleman's disease)  could  not  be  detected  by  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was able to identify 61% of patients with sarcoidosis and the only patient with tuberculosis. Overall,  34  of  48  patients  (71%)  were  classified  correctly  by Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA.\nAs  we  performed  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA  and  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBFB  of the  same  index  lymph  node,  we  can  reliably  compare these methods. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBFB significantly improved the\ndiagnostic yield in benign conditions compared to EBUSTBNA (  table 2  ).

      "title": "Discussion",
      "content": "In this prospective comparative trial, we have demonstrated the safety and clinical effectiveness of a novel twoin-one lymph node forceps for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided TBFB.\nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA has been extensively evaluated in diagnosing and staging of Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This diagnostic procedure has an excellent yield in normal sized and enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, with a sensitivity of 84-\n94%   [3, 4, 18-20]  . In this study, the diagnostic yield of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was marginally lower than reported before in bigger studies. Technologies resulting in an increased output of cell block material could perhaps improve the overall detection rates of malignant diseases. In our study, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBFB demonstrated equivalent results and confirmed mediastinal metastasis in 12 of 16 cases (75%) with Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\nIn one case, the final diagnosis changed from adenocarcinoma to large cell carcinoma after evaluation of the specimen obtained by the lymph node forceps. In this regard, it is essential to recognise that personalised chemotherapy regimens must be based on accurate molecular subtyping of Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). It can be expected that this aspect will gain importance in the future with further development of molecular markers. It has been shown that tissue samples obtained by Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA are sufficient for molecular testing such as EGFR mutation or gene fusions/ translocations  such  as EML4-ALK mutation    [21,  22]  . However, nobody can argue that more material volume enables pathologists to do more molecular tests and that this could result in a more specific treatment.\nThe diagnostic value of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, which provides cell groups for a cytological evaluation instead of tissue for histological analysis in the majority of the cases, is less well established in patients with sarcoidosis or other benign diseases   [3, 6, 8, 9, 23]  . The reason for a suboptimal diagnostic  hit  rate  may  be  the  small  specimen  size  by Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA that does not allow adequate pathological analysis because the general tissue architecture cannot be evaluated. The use of mini-forceps guided by Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) has been evaluated by other investigators. However, there are\na  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA vs. a combined approach.\nsignificant practical difficulties using these devices. The technique used is cumbersome, being a 2-stage process wherein a hole is first created in the bronchial wall using a 19-gauge needle and the mini-forceps is subsequently introduced into the subcarinal lymph node. The diagnostic yield with such a procedure is increased with respect to Hodgkin disease, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and sarcoidosis   [10-13]  . In a recent study using another type of forceps, diagnostic sensitivity increased to 82% when Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA and Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided  forceps  biopsies  were combined   [14]  . However, these studies have been performed mainly in subcarinal nodes, and the blunt forceps did  not  pass  the  perforated  mucosa  and  penetrate  the lymph node in all cases. The need for a second instrument  (TBNA-needle  and  mini-forceps)  and  a  second bronchoscope is time consuming and financially detrimental. Therefore, there is a need for a reliable two-inone instrument which can puncture the mucosa and take forceps biopsies. One such device developed by Gasparini et al.   [15] achieved a diagnostic yield of 57.1%. The limitation of this study was that it did not use Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) guidance and consequently failed to obtain adequate specimens  in  28.5%  of  cases    [15]  .  In  a  more  recent  study, Herth et al.   [24] reported the use of a two-in-one forceps device  (manufactured  by  Olympus  Medical  Systems Corp.,  Japan)  with  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)  guidance.  They  reported  an overall diagnostic yield of 86% and were unable to obtain adequate histologic specimens in 10% of cases   [24]  . The applied instrument seems to be comparable to the one used  in  this  study.  However,  a  direct  comparison  between these two devices is not possible as the former is\nnot commercially available. Using the opposite bronchial wall as a counterforce (  fig. 5  ), our lymph node forceps could pass through the bronchial wall in all cases. Only in the first patient recruited for the study did the lymph node forceps not penetrate the lymph node after passing the mucosa, and the obtained material was considered inadequate for histological evaluation. With further experience, the lymph node forceps reached the lymphatic tissue in all other cases.\nPrevious  studies  have  indicated  that  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA can have a diagnostic yield in sarcoidosis of 54-93% at least in experienced centres   [8, 9]  . A recent meta-analysis of Agarwal et al.   [25] in 553 patients suggests an excellent overall diagnostic yield of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA in this field.  We  observed  a  sensitivity  of  61%  in  sarcoidosis patients. This lower value can be attributed to some possible reasons. First, we did not use rapid onsite cytology which  could  have  improved  the  diagnostic  yield  of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA.  Second,  only  3  biopsies  have  been  obtained from the index lymph node. Garwood et al.   [9] found that the yield exceeded 80% at 5 passes, whereas it was below 70% at 3 passes. Third, the diagnosis of sarcoidosis has to be evaluated carefully. The detection of isolated epithelioid cells cannot be regarded as adequate to diagnose sarcoidosis on its own because these findings are also seen in reactive changes. With the additional use of the lymph node forceps, an increased sensitivity of 94% could be achieved. Our results were comparable  to  those  obtained  by  other  investigators  who used  a  similar  device    [10,  24]  .  If  mediastinal  lymph nodes are affected by sarcoidosis, mediastinoscopy remains an option when other bronchoscopic procedures have not been diagnostic   [26, 27]  . However, hilar lymph nodes, which are mostly affected by this disease, are not accessible by standard cervical mediastinoscopy. In addition, mediastinoscopy is an invasive procedure and is therefore associated with a higher morbidity compared to  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA    [28,  29]  .  Our  findings  suggest  that lymph node forceps may be useful, especially in patients suspected to have a benign disease as the use of TBFB avoids a more invasive surgical diagnostic procedure in 6 (13%) of the cases.\nClinicians demand diagnostic techniques that are safe and effective. This is even more relevant when evaluating new endoscopic biopsy devices, which attempt to obtain additional lymph nodal tissue and are therefore more invasive than conventional TBNA. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA has low morbidity and mortality compared to cervical mediastinoscopy   [27,  30,  31]  .  Therefore,  each  novel  method  or device has to be proven on safety issues. In our study of a\nnew Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided lymph node forceps, no complications in patients or with endoscopes were observed. However, the presence of blood vessels in the target area of EBUSTBFB should be carefully investigated by Doppler sonography.\nIt  is  important  to  point  out  that  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBFB  is  a promising technique, but it does require advanced bronchoscopic skills and leads to an extended examination time, albeit minimal. One limitation of this study is the lack of rapid onsite evaluation of the TBNA specimens, which  could  have  improved  the  diagnostic  yield  of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA.\nIn conclusion, the use of a dedicated two-in-one lymph node forceps to perform Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided TBFB is feasible, safe, and it provides histologic specimens even of slightly enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes. The diagnostic yield is significantly increased in benign diseases compared to Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA alone.",
