This randomized controlled trial compared the efficacy and safety of 1% and 2% lignocaine solution for topical anesthesia during FB.\nMETHODS: Consecutive patients were randomized to receive either 1% or 2% lignocaine solution through the bronchoscope by the “spray-as-you-go” technique. The primary outcome of the study was the assessment of cough by the operator and the patient using the visual analog scale (VAS) and pain assessment using the faces pain rating scale. The secondary outcomes included total lignocaine dose, oxygenation status, adverse reactions related to lignocaine, and others.\nRESULTS: Five hundred patients were randomized (median age, 51 years; 71% men) 1:1 to either group. The median operator VAS score for cough was significantly higher (25 vs 21, P 5 .015) in the 1% group; however, the patient VAS score was not significantly different (32 vs 27, P5.065). The pain rating was similar between the two groups. The median cumulative dose of lignocaine was significantly higher in the 2% group (397 mg vs 312 mg, P 5 .0001; 7.1 mg/kg vs 5.7 mg/kg, P 5 .0001). About 28% of patients in the 2% group exceeded the maximum recommended dose (. 8.2 mg/kg) of lignocaine. No adverse event related to lignocaine overdose was seen in either group.\nCONCLUSIONS: One percent lignocaine was found to be as effective as 2% solution for topical anesthesia during FB, albeit at a significantly lower dose as the latter. Thus, 1% lignocaine should be the preferred concentration for topical anesthesia during FB.",

DOI: 10.1378/chest.15-0022\n]\nFlexible bronchoscopy (FB) is a widely used procedure for the diagnosis and treatment of a variety of bronchopulmonary disorders because of patient comfort, low rate of complications, and lack of requirement of general anesthesia. 1  Most patients tolerate the procedure well although cough is reported to be an extremely distressing symptom.  2  It is likely that the acceptance of bronchoscopy would be signifi  cantly improved with control of cough. A combination of midazolam and hydrocodone has been shown to signifi  cantly reduce cough during FB, especially when invasive diagnostic procedures are performed.  3  However, in several centers including ours, due to logistics, sedation is not routinely used during basic diagnostic bronchoscopy; procedures such as BAL, endobronchial biopsy (EBB), and transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) are performed under topical anesthesia.\nLignocaine is the most common local anesthetic used during FB because of its quick onset, short duration of action, and lesser toxicity compared with other agents. 4  Th e use of topical lignocaine during FB has been shown to improve patient's tolerance and satisfaction of\nthe procedure. 5,6  Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that nebulized lignocaine can reduce the need for supplemental topical anesthesia, administered as injection through the bronchoscope.  7,8  Th e optimal concentration of lignocaine as topical anesthesia, however, remains speculative, and 1% and 2% concentrations of lignocaine solutions are commonly used. The British Thoracic Society guidelines recommend the use of 1% lignocaine while the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) consensus statement endorses a wide range of lignocaine concentrations (1%-10%) that have been found to be eff  ective without advocating any particular value. 9,10\nTh ere is little data on the effi cacy of lower concentrations (1%-2%) of lignocaine. 11  It is important that the superiority of a particular concentration be ascertained, as eff  ectiveness of lower concentrations would allow the use of higher volumes with lesser chances of complications. In this randomized controlled trial (RCT), we report the effi cacy and safety of 1% vs 2% lignocaine for topical anesthesia in patients undergoing FB.",

Patients in both the groups were prepared in a similar fashion except for the concentration of lignocaine used. All patients were kept fasting overnight. The patients\nwere nebulized with 2.5 mL of 4% lignocaine (Lox, 42.7 mg/mL; Neon Laboratories Ltd) for 15 min prior to the procedure. Lignocaine spray (10%, Lox, 100 mg/mL; Neon Laboratories Ltd) was sprayed twice (10 mg/puff  ) over the oropharynx. Approximately 5 mL of lignocaine gel (2%; Neon Laboratories Ltd), equivalent to 100 mg of lignocaine, was administered in the nasal cavity prior to the introduction of the bronchoscope. Patients thereaft  er received 2-mL aliquots of 1% or 2% lignocaine solution  (Wocaine;  Wockhardt)  delivered  through  the  bronchoscope using the ''spray-as-you-go'' technique. Four aliquots of 2 mL of lignocaine were administered: one each at the vocal cord, tracheal carina, and in the right and left   main bronchus. Extra lignocaine aliquots were given as a ''rescue'' treatment to suppress cough, at the discretion of the operator. Th e sum of the standard dose (2.5 mL of 4% nebulized lignocaine [106.75 mg] plus 5 mL of 2% lignocaine gel [100 mg] plus two puff  s of 10% lignocaine spray [20 mg] plus 8 mL of 1% [85.2 mg] or 2% [170.4 mg] lignocaine) and rescue dose made up the total dose of lignocaine used. Patients were monitored for any adverse eff  ects related to lignocaine use (like arrhythmia, involuntary movements, convulsions, anaphylaxis, and bronchospasm). Heart rate, respiratory rate, BP , and oxy  gen saturation (by pulse oximetry) were monitored throughout the procedure.\nTh e  bronchoscopist  was  asked  to  assess  the  intensity  of  the  patient's cough during FB using a visual analog scale (VAS) immediately aft  er the procedure. The VAS for cough was rated on a horizontal line, 100 mm in length anchored by 'No cough' at one end and 'Worst cough' at the other. 12  Once stable, the patients recorded their quantum of cough and pain using the VAS and the faces pain rating scale, respectively. Th e faces pain rating scale consists of six faces with brief word instructions provided with the scale representing increasing intensity of pain on an ordinal scale from 0 to 5. 13",

      "content": "Th e result of this large RCT demonstrates that 1% and 2% concentrations of lignocaine solution are equally eff  ective in anesthetizing the airway. Th e bronchoscopistreported VAS scores for cough were higher in the 1% lignocaine group; the diff  erence although statistically significant is unlikely to be clinically relevant as the\n]\nmedian diff  erence of VAS score was merely four points on a scale ranging from 0 to 100. Moreover, the diff  erence was not signifi  cant in the patients' own assessment of their cough in the two groups. Th e pain rating was also not diff  erent in the two groups. Th e cumulative dose in the 1% arm was signifi  cantly lower compared with the other group. Thus, 1% lignocaine could achieve topical anesthesia during bronchoscopy as eff  ectively as 2% but at a much lower dose compared with 2% lignocaine.\nMost guidelines currently recommend performance of FB under IV sedation.  9,10  However, in our center, due to high patient load and lower doctor-to-patient ratio, basic diagnostic procedures such as BAL, EBB, and TBLB are performed under topical anesthesia without any IV sedation. Although sedation should be used wherever possible, 3,14  local anesthesia can be achieved within 2 min of endotracheal lignocaine application, which blunts the cough refl  ex eff  ectively, 15  allowing for safe and comfortable performance of FB.  16\nAll values are expressed as median with interquartile range, unless otherwise stated.\nAll values are mean (SD) unless otherwise stated.   P , .05 was taken as signifi  cant. The diff  erences between the means was analyzed using multiple repeated measure analysis of variance with Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons; the within-groups factor was time (baseline, during, and after), and the between-groups factor was the lignocaine groups (1% vs 2%). FB 5 fl  exible bronchoscopy.\nFew studies have evaluated the effective lignocaine concentration for topical anesthesia during FB (  T able 4  ). 11,17-19    Of the four, one has been published only as an abstract while three are peer reviewed. 19  Of the three peer-reviewed studies, only a single study was performed in the bronchoscopy suite, while the other two studies were conducted in the operating suite and are, thus, diff  erent from the routine practice in the bronchoscopy suite. Th e results of these studies suggest that 2% is as effi cacious as 4% solution while 1% is as eff  ective at 2% lignocaine. Th e limitation of these studies apart from diff  ering methodologies is the small sample size. Th e results of our study supplement these studies and confi  rm that 1% lignocaine solution is as efficacious as 2% but has the added advantage of effectiveness at signifi  cantly lower cumulative dose.\nTh   ese fi  ndings are important for routine practice as there are reported cases of death from presumed lignocaine toxicity after FB. 20,21  In fact, 28% of patients in the 2% lignocaine arm of our study exceeded the dose of . 8.2 mg/kg, recommended as the maximum dose by the British Th oracic Society. 22  In another study, the anesthetists used doses of up to 14.8 mg/kg lignocaine by a spray-as-you-go method in a study involving volunteer subjects undergoing awake fi  ber-optic intubation; some volunteers were reported to have experienced involuntary movements, symptoms that may precede convulsions, which is a sign of lignocaine toxicity. 23  Th e pharmacokinetics of topical lignocaine during FB are complex and can be influenced by several factors, including the duration and frequency of suctioning. 24  This means that the plasma levels\nAll values in median (interquartile range), unless mentioned.

See   Table 2 and 3 legends for expansion of other abbreviations.\n]\nachieved in an individual patient are often unpredictable. 25-29  However, the propensity would increase with increasing doses of lignocaine used. By using 1% lignocaine, the risk of potential toxicity would be lower although it is still essential to carefully monitor the amount of lignocaine administered during FB. Another important benefit of a lower concentration would be the usage in patients with renal and hepatic dysfunction, as well as in patients with airway infl  ammation and pediatric age group, as the dose would be minimized.\nFinally, our study is not without limitations. Th ere were several factors in our study that could aff  ect the outcomes. Th ese were multiple operators (consultants, fellows), variable duration of bronchoscopy, wide range of indications, and concomitant procedures. However,\nthey were equally distributed between the two groups. Th e other limitation could be the lack of widespread generalization of our results given the fact that IV sedation was not used while a vast majority of bronchoscopists use sedation. However, lack of sedation can also be regarded as a major strength of the study as it allowed a clear assessment of the cough severity by the patient in contrast to the previous study where the patients were sedated. 11  Th e other obvious strength of the study is the large sample size.\nIn conclusion, the results of this study suggest that 1% lignocaine is similar in effi cacy to 2% lignocaine for topical anesthesia during FB, at signifi  cantly lower doses of lignocaine. Hence, 1% lignocaine should be the preferred concentration for topical anesthesia of the larynx and the tracheobronchial tree during FB.",
