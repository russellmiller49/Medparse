In addition, there is an increased demand in interventional fiberoptic bronchoscopy for stent placement or laser surgery performed in the operating room [2,3].\nIn order to achieve optimal position and performance of lung isolation devices, every anesthesiologist must have knowledge of the trachea and bronchial anatomy and its variants. In addition, knowledge of flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy techniques is required during placement of lung isolation devices and interventional bronchoscopy cases.\nThis review focuses on the normal anatomy of the trachea and bronchus and the changes that occur with age, a\ncomplete fiberoptic bronchoscopy examination and examples of fiberoptic bronchoscopy during placement of lung isolation devices.",

      "content": "The trachea is a cartilaginous and fibromuscular tubular structure that extends from the inferior aspect of the cricoid cartilage to the level of the carina [4 /C15/C15 ]. The adult trachea is, on average, 15 cm long. The trachea is composed of 16-22 C-shaped cartilages. The cartilages compose the anterior and lateral walls of the trachea and are connected posteriorly by the membranous wall of the trachea, which lacks cartilage and is supported by the trachealis muscle.\nThe average diameter in a normal trachea is 22 mm in men and 19mm in women. In men, the coronal diameter ranges from 13 to 25 mm and the sagittal diameter ranges from 13 to 27mm. In women, the average coronal diameter is 10-21mm and the sagittal is 10-23mm [4 /C15/C15 ,5].

With Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or aging, the lateral diameter of the trachea may decrease with an increase in the anteroposterior diameter. Conversely, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may also lead to softening of the tracheal rings with a decrease in the anteroposterior diameter of the trachea [6 /C15/C15 ]. The cricoid cartilage is the narrowest part of the trachea with an average diameter of 17 mm in men and 13 mm in women.\nThe trachea bifurcates at the carina into the right and left mainstem bronchus. An important fact is that the tracheal lumen narrows slightly as it progresses towards the carina. The tracheal bifurcation is located at the level of the sternal angle anteriorly and the 5th thoracic vertebra posteriorly. The right mainstem bronchus lies in a more vertical orientation relative to the trachea, whereas the left mainstem bronchus lies in a more horizontal plane. The right mainstem bronchus continues as the bronchus intermedius after the take-off of the right upper lobe bronchus. In men, the average distance from the tracheal carina to the take-off of the right upper lobe bronchus is an average of 2.0 cm, whereas it is approximately 1.5 cm in women. One in every 250 individuals from the general population may have an abnormal take-off of the right upper lobe bronchus emerging from above the tracheal carina on the right side. The diameter of the right mainstem bronchus is an average of 17.5 mm in men and 14 mm in women. The trifurcation of the right upper lobe bronchus consists of the apical, anterior and posterior division. This is a very important landmark to identify while performing fiberoptic bronchoscopy in order to distinguish the right from the left mainstem bronchus. The distance from the tracheal carina to the bifurcation of the left upper and left lower lobe is approximately 5.0 cm in men and 4.5 cm in women. The left mainstem bronchus is longer than the right mainstem bronchus, and it divides into the left upper and the left lower lobe bronchus. The left upper lobe bronchus has a superior and inferior division. Figure 1 displays the anatomical distances of the airway. Figures 2, 3 and 4 correspond to a multidetector three-dimensional computer tomography scan of the chest [7 /C15 ] displaying the trachea and bronchial anatomy in a 25-year-old healthy volunteer (Fig. 2), in a 60-year-old healthy woman (Fig. 3), and in a 60-year-old man with severe Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Fig. 4), which shows a deviated trachea and narrow bronchus.",

      "title": "Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy examination after intubation",
      "content": "Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy is a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure of great value in the clinical practice of anesthesia. The most common method to perform flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy is with the use of a single-lumen endotracheal tube. Once the tube is advanced beyond the vocal cords and inside the trachea, the tip of the endotracheal tube should come to rest 3-4cm above the tracheal carina. A Portex fiberoptic bronchoscope (SSL Americas, Inc., Norcross, Georgia, USA) swivel adapter with a self-sealing valve is used to facilitate ventilation and manipulation of the\nbronchoscope at the same time. When using a large singlelumenendotrachealtube,anadultfiberopticbronchoscope should be used (4.1 mm inner diameter). Another alternative to perform fiberoptic bronchoscopy is with the use of a\nlaryngeal mask airway (LMA). This technique allows visualization of the vocal cords and subglottic structures with lower resistance than a single-lumen endotracheal tube when the bronchoscope is inserted.\nA systematic and complete fiberoptic bronchoscopy examination includes a clear view of the anterior wall (tracheal cartilage) and posterior wall (membranous portion) of the trachea below the vocal cords and of the tracheal carina. When advancing the bronchoscope through the right mainstem bronchus, a clear view of the bronchus intermedius should be seen, and at 3 o'clock the orifice of the right upper bronchus should also be seen. As the scope is advanced inside the take-off of the right upper bronchus, a clear view of the orifices is found: apical, anterior and posterior segments. This is the only structure in the tracheobronchial tree that has three orifices. After withdrawing the bronchoscope from the right upper bronchus, it is advanced distally into the bronchus intermedius in order to identify the middle and lower right lobe bronchi. The right middle bronchus has the shape of a letter D. Once the complete examination has been performed on the right mainstem bronchus, the bronchoscope is withdrawn until the tracheal carina is seen again. Then the bronchoscope is readvanced into the left mainstem bronchus in which the bifurcation into left upper and lower lobe is visualized. The anatomical distance from tracheal carina to the bifurcation on the left-sided bronchus is approximately 4-5cm in length. Figure 5 shows a complete fiberoptic bronchoscopy view of the trachea and bronchus.\nA shows a clear view of the tracheal carina. B shows the take-off of the right upper bronchus. C shows the apical, anterior, and posterior segments of the right upper lobe bronchus (RULB). D shows the right middle lobe (RML) and the right lower lobe bronchus (RLL). E shows a view of the left upper lobe (LUL) and the left lower lobe bronchus (LLL).\n(a)",

      "content": "The use of flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy in thoracic anesthesia has increased the margin of safety and optimal position of DLTs. A study by Klein et al. [8] has shown\nthat auscultation and clamping maneuvers alone of one of the limbs of the adaptor for the DLT was not a reliable method to confirm placement, and it led to up to a 35% incidence of malpositions. In contrast, when fiberoptic bronchoscopy was used to reconfirm DLT placement and position, all malpositions were corrected.

(c) The take-off of the right upper bronchus with the three segments (apical, anterior, and posterior); this is a landmark to reconfirm a right bronchus.\nshows the benefits of using fiberoptic bronchoscopy while placing a DLT. A study by Campos et al. [9] has shown that anesthesiologists with limited thoracic experience have a high incidence of malpositions (38%) while placing DLTs or bronchial blockers. In this study, one of the factors that contributed to unsuccessful placement of these devices was the lack of recognition of tracheobronchial anatomy.\nThe basic fiberoptic bronchoscopy examination for achieving optimal position of a right-sided DLT is shown in Fig. 6; Fig. 7 shows the optimal position of a left-sided DLT with the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope.\nAnother advantage of the use of flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy is with the use of bronchial blockers during lung isolation. Previous studies have shown the benefits of using flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy as an aid to pass a guide-wire bronchial blocker, to achieve the optimal position of the device and correct intraoperative malpositions [10,11]. Figure 8 shows the proper position of an Arndt wire-guided endobronchial blocker (William Cook Europe A/S, Bjaeverskor, Denmark). The optimal position is achieved with the use of a fiberscope. The proximal surface of the fully inflated balloon should be positioned at least 5-10 mm below the tracheal carina in the corresponding mainstem bronchus. While placing a right-sided bronchial blocker, if the distance between the tracheal carina and the take-off of the right upper lobe bronchus is too short (i.e. less than 1.0 cm), a proper adjustment with the fully inflated balloon needs to be made, making sure that the proximal surface of the balloon is located below the entrance of the right mainstem bronchus. Figure 9 shows the proper position of a bronchial blocker on the right mainstem bronchus.\nFlexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy is also used to perform endobronchial metal stent implantation. Another use of flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy in anesthesia is during the\nuse of airway exchange guide-wire catheters. Complete fiberscope examination is indicated following airway exchange catheter use owing to the potential risk of perforation that the catheter presents to the tracheobronchial tree.",
