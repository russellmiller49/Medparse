    "abstract": "PURPOSE: To compare procedure times and complication rates of preincisional ultrasonographic (US) evaluation and perioperative US guidance in percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy ( PDT percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy ) with those of the current standard of care, PDT percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy performed without image guidance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between December 2007 and January 2011, 341 patients were included in this institutional review board-approved study after informed consent was obtained from the patients or their relatives. The patients were divided randomly into two groups. In group A (n = 166), the possible causes of complications, such as aberrations of tracheal, thyroidal, and vascular structures, were determined with US, and tracheal measurements were performed by using US. The clinician's initial considerations at physical examination were compared with the US findings. PDT percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy was subsequently performed with US guidance in suitable cases. In group B (n = 175), PDT percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy was performed solely on the basis of physical landmarks. The procedure times and complication rates were compared across groups by using the Fisher exact test. RESULTS: In group A, the puncture sites designated at the physical examination were reconsidered in 39 (23.8%) of 164 cases. The perioperative complication rates were slightly lower in group A (7.8% [12 of 154]) than in group B (15.0% [25 of 167]); however, the difference did not achieve statistical significance (P = .054). The mean procedure times for groups A and B were 24.09 minutes ± 8.05 (standard deviation) (range, 14-68 minutes) and 18.62 minutes ± 6.34 (range, 12-81 minutes), respectively (P = .001), and the numbers of patients in each group who required multiple puncture attempts were six (3.9%) of 154 and 23 (13.6%) of 169 (P = .003), respectively. CONCLUSION: The use of US guidance before and during PDT percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy could render the procedure easier and safer, with fewer complications but a slightly longer procedure time.",

Patients in the pediatric age group (0-16 years  of  age)  and  those  with  high  or unstable intracranial pressures, severe coagulation  disorders,  and/or  evident cervical  spine  precautions  were  excluded.  The  patients  were  randomly separated into two groups at the time that the decision to perform PTD was made.  This  was  prior  to  physical  examination of the neck. In group A ( n = 166; mean age, 59.56 years 6 14.87 [standard deviation]; age range, 18-89 years; 71 women, 95 men), preoperative  US  examinations  of  the  puncture area  were  performed  by  a  single  radiologist (A.Y., with 10 years of experience in neck US examinations and 5 years of experience in US-guided interventional  procedures).  All  measured tracheal  dimensions  were  recorded, and  any  conditions  that  may  complicate a PDT procedure were noted. No visible  mark  was  applied  to  the  skin\n(3) reported that in cadavers, nine of 20 insertions were correctly placed at the  level  planned  for  the  PDT.  Theoretically,  the  physical  landmarks  of the  neck  should  be  clearly  identified to assess a suitable puncture location for  PDT;  in  practice,  this  method  is not  possible  for  all  patients  in  the ICU. Short necks, deviated tracheas, massive  goiters,  previous  neck  surgery,  obesity,  edema,  subcutaneous emphysema,  and  difficulties  in  the positioning  of  unconscious  patients are  the  principal  complicating  factors. Results of previous studies (4-8) have demonstrated the benefits of ultrasonographic  (US)  imaging  during the  PDT  procedure;  however,  to  our knowledge, no randomized controlled trials comparing the current standard care with US-assisted PDT have been reported.

Deep sedation followed by neuromuscular blockade was maintained by means of intravenous  infusion  of  propofol  (Diprivan;  AstraZeneca  Pharmaceuticals, London, England) and administration of fentanyl-vecuronium  (fentanyl  citrate, Abbot Laboratories, North Chicago, Ill; and  Norcuron,  Organon  Pharmaceuticals,  Fresnes,  France),  respectively. After  sterilization  of  the  skin,  the  endotracheal tube was withdrawn to the laryngeal inlet under the vocal cords to prevent  the  perforation  of  the  cuff  by the  seeking  needle.  Placement  of  the tube shaft and its cuff levels were ensured by detecting the shaft's echogenic US 'double-line' appearance at the anterior margins of the tracheas (Fig 3). Consecutive inflations and deflations of the balloon with real-time US visualization were used to ensure a definite cuffballoon  level  (Movie  1  [online]).  The insertion of the seeking needle was performed with US guidance to achieve the tracheal puncture through the planned midline level. The insertion routes were determined  by  identifying  the  slight echogenicity  of  the  needle;  and,  in most cases, tilting the needle was used to aid in its recognition when necessary (Movie 2 [online]). The advancement of the  needle  tip  was  limited  on  the  basis of the previously measured tracheal depth  to  avoid  posterior  tracheal  wall injuries.

      "content": "In  group  A,  standard  7.5-12.5-MHz linear probes were used in most cases, whereas 5.0-10.0-MHz microconvex probes (PVF-745 V Micro Convex Ultrasound Probe; Toshiba Medical Systems, Tokyo,  Japan)  were  preferred  for  the US examinations in patients with short necks.  Doppler  US  imaging  was  used in patients with aberrant vascularity to reveal the arterial or venous origin (Fig E1  [online]).  Increased  thyroidal  isthmic vascularity was considered, particularly  when  it  was  accompanied  by  a thickened ( ≥ 10 mm) thyroidal isthmus (Fig  E2  [online]).  In  these  conditions, altered  puncture  levels  (either  more cranial or more caudal) were preferred to prevent possible complications due to\nof the neck at the initial US evaluation to  avoid  the  possibility  of  influencing the clinician. The initial physical examination  assessments  were  performed by  a  clinician  (M.Y.,  with  300-case experience  with  the  PDT  procedure) who  was  blinded  to  the  US  findings. These assessments, including the feasibility of PDT and the estimated puncture locations, were then recorded for each patient. After the insertion point, which  depended  on  the  physical  examination  findings,  was  decided  and marked by the clinician, the US check was immediately repeated. The insertion point, which was determined by a radiologist  (A.Y.)  with  the  assistance of  US,  was  again  marked,  and  two marks that were consecutively placed were compared in terms of unity. The necessity  for  a  puncture  site  revision was considered and recorded in detail. The clinician's estimation of the puncture  point  was  considered  inaccurate when the distance from the midline of the  trachea  to  the  marked  puncture point's nearest margin was more than 1  mm  laterally  in  the  coronal  plane (measurements  were  performed  with a  ruler)  and/or  when  the  puncture point  was  not  placed  at  the  intended intercartilage  gap  in  the  craniocaudal plane.\nThe  final  decision  of  whether  to perform  PDT  or  refer  the  patient  for surgical  tracheostomy  was  based  on the US findings; if a decision in favor of PDT was made, the procedure was performed with US guidance. In group B ( n = 175; mean age, 57.52 years 6 11.39; age range, 19-91 years; 76 women, 99 men),  the  procedure  was  completed 'blindly'-that is, without peri- or preoperative US assistance. Physical landmarks were used to locate the puncture site.\nThe  patients  in  groups  A  and  B were assessed at physical examination in  terms  of  whether  they  had  short necks  (distance  between  the  cricoid cartilage  and  the  sternal  notch, ≤ 3 cm)  that  might  complicate  PDT.

The  initial  decision  of  the clinician for PDT on the basis of physical  examination  findings  was  revised to  surgical  tracheostomy  after  US  in nine  patients.  Conditions  presenting a possibility of major complications in six patients, and extremely short necks in three patients, led to the preference for surgical tracheostomy. The radiologist agreed with the clinicians' initial decisions for surgical tracheostomy after US examination in three patients. At  physical  examination,  a  palpated pulsatile vessel along the puncture site (confirmed as a high-located brachiocephalic trunk at US) was a consideration in one patient. Massive subcutaneous emphysema inhibited the ability to assess the neck with a physical examination or US in two patients.\nIn group B ( n = 175), surgical tracheostomies were preferred by the clinician in six patients. A subcutaneous\ndilated  vessel  over  the  trachea  was palpated  in  one  patient;  this  vessel was subsequently identified as the anterior  jugular  vein  at  US  (this  patient was still counted in group B). Massive goiters  in  two  patients  and  extremely short necks in three patients were the prominent causes of suboptimal physical examination and surgical tracheostomy decisions by the clinician. In two patients,  PDT  was  initially  preferred; however, PDT could not be successfully completed in these patients (after multiple  unsuccessful  puncture  attempts), and  they  were  referred  for  surgical tracheostomy.",

In group A, one case of major bleeding was hypothesized to be related to mild coagulopathy from chronic renal failure, while four cases of minor bleeding were attributed to a thick thyroidal isthmus in one patient (the puncture was made through the isthmus parenchyma because  of  the  lack  of  hypervascularity), a thick and hypervascular thyroidal isthmus in one patient (minor bleeding occurred  even  after  the  puncture  level was  revised  caudally  according  to  US findings), and relatively difficult deployments of the PDT tubes because of evident tracheal deviations in two patients (Fig E3 [online]).

In our study, irregularly formed tracheal rings were  detected  in  17  (10.6%)  of  161 patients.  Previous  investigators  (5,6) found that the initial puncture levels for PDT had to be reconsidered in 20%24%  of  patients  after  US  scanning, which is similar to our rate of 23.8% (39  of 164  patients). A  substantial number of patients in this group (12 of 39) had deviated tracheas, which were demonstrated at US.\nThe  penetration  of  the  thyroidal isthmus during PDT has been reported to  occur  relatively  frequently  without serious complications (7); however, Bonde et al (2) preferred to locate the thyroidal isthmus by using preincisional US to prevent isthmus puncture, which is accompanied by the risk of bleeding. In  our  study,  we  also  checked  for  the the  presence  of  the  thyroidal  isthmus along  the  puncture  site  and  revised the puncture level only in patients with thick and hypervascular thyroidal isthmi.  A  surgical  tracheostomy  was  preferred for two patients with thick and hypervascular thyroidal isthmi that extended to the retrosternal space.\nIn our study, conditions that could complicate PDT were detected at higher  rates  in  patients  with  short  necks than  in  patients  with  normal-length necks in each of our study groups. In a  study  by  Muhammad  et  al  (14),  33 patients  with  approximately  1  cm  or less  of  tracheal  segment  between  the cricoid ring and the superior margin of the  sternum  were  classified  as  having short necks at US examination. Surgical tracheostomy was performed in nine of these  33  patients  because  the  cricoid ring was found to be below the sternal notch. In our study, three of the 40 patients  with  short  necks  were  referred for  surgical  tracheostomy;  this  difference is likely related to our 3-cm and 1-cm definitions of a short neck and an extremely short neck, respectively.\napproach,  we  utilized  US  to  precisely quantify the tracheal dimensions to enable  the  selection  of  tubes  of  the  appropriate  size.  We  hypothesized  that the use of US would have a preventative  effect  against  the  rare  complications of PDT, such as the formation of a trachea-brachiocephalic trunk fistula, particularly given the two main mechanisms of the entity, as follows: first, the pressure effects of the cuff of the tube or the distal tip on the anterior tracheal wall; and second, anterior tracheal wall ischemia  from  the  pressure  generated by  angulated  tube  necks  (16).  In  our study,  two  cases  of  extensive  bleeding  related  to  trachea-brachiocephalic\nendotracheal tube damage,  hypoxia, hypotension and arrhythmias, cuff leaks,  endotracheal  tube  obstruction, loss  of  airway,  premature  extubation, and wound infection (9-13). The presence  of  anatomic  vascular  variations, tracheal aberrations, or accompanying cervical disease or disorder can lead to increased complication rates (14).\nResults of previous studies (5,6,15) have  prompted  the  use  of  US  before PDT as an efficacious  method  for  the prevention  of  potential  complications. In  addition  to  using  US  to  identify anomalous vasculature and appropriate insertion  levels  and  to  triage  patients to either a surgical or a percutaneous",

Future  studies  with  extended  series  are suggested to verify our findings. Significantly fewer multiple puncture attempts were  required  to  access  the  tracheal lumen in  the  patients  who  underwent US-guided PDT ( P = .003).\nThe limitations of this study were as follows: First, we excluded pediatric patients and patients with evident cervical spine precautions that prevented proper patient positioning; the outcomes of our study  support  the  hypothesis  that  US guidance  is  beneficial  for  PDT  in  such patients.  Second,  comparisons  of  the results  of  long-term  follow-up  and  the effects of obesity were neglected (accurate  body  mass  index  calculation  could not be achieved for patients in the ICU because of their clinical status). The inability to blind the observer to the treatment group  was  a  necessary  limitation of our study. Because the procedures of the different groups were performed by different physicians, some of the differences  in  complication  rates  may  have resulted from differences in the surgeon rather  than  from  differences  in  image evaluation and guidance. A small sample size  limited  our  ability  to  demonstrate significant  differences  in  some  group comparisons.\nIn conclusion, PDT could be a safer procedure  when  performed  by  using peri-  and  preoperative  US  assistance; despite an acceptable increase in procedure  times,  the  use  of  US  guidance for PDT could reduce the complication rates of the procedure.\nDisclosures  of  Conflicts  of  Interest:  A.Y. disclosed no relevant relationships.

Prior  studies  (19-21)  have revealed the feasibility of the selection of  more  accurately  sized  endotracheal tubes for pediatric patients on the basis of US measurements of the tracheal dimensions. In our report, we suggest that  measurement  of  the  tracheal  dimensions with US in adults could be an effective  method  to  select  PDT  tubes of  the  most appropriate diameter and length. We used tubes with extra length in  the  proximal  portion  for  patients with  deep-set  tracheas  to  prevent  the complications  caused  by  tubes  of  improper lengths that have been reported by Mallick et al (22).\nSusti ć and  colleagues (23) used Doppler  US  and  Rezende-Neto  et  al (24) used US to ensure that the withdraw  level  of  the  endotracheal  tube would  prevent  cuff  perforation  by  the seeking  needle.  In  our  study,  US  examination in the midline-sagittal plane during the pullback of the cuff showed the  tube  shafts  as  echogenic  'doubleline' structures near the tracheal anterior  air  interface  that  ended  with  the irregular  round  opacities  of  the  cuff balloon.  Consecutive  inflation  and  deflation  of  the  cuff  accurately  showed the  cuff  level  in  instances  in  which  it was imprecise. The penetration length of  the  seeking  needle  was  limited  to a  calculated  tracheal  depth  to  prevent posterior tracheal wall damage. Chacko et al (8) reported the advantages of US guidance by an introduced cannula and guidewire  insertions  during  PDT;  our findings were similar to those of their study. We used US to ensure the proper direction of the guidewire; the identification of the penetration angle through the intercartilage gap could indicate the direction of the extension.\nIn  previous  studies,  the  complication  rates  of  standard  PDT  have  been reported  to  be  between  5.1%  and 19%  (10-12,25),  and  the  procedure times  have  ranged  from  8  to  26  minutes (2,25-27). In our study, despite its  negative  effect  on  the  procedure time, the use of US guidance for PDT reduced the perioperative complication\n15.  Hatfield  A,  Bodenham  A.
