      "content": "The Cleveland Clinic Foundation (CCF) is a tertiary care academic medical center based in Cleveland, Ohio. Since its' founding the Cleveland Clinic has operated as a multidisciplinary physician run group practice.\nThe practice of Interventional Pulmonology started at  the  Cleveland Clinic on September 20, 1983. Atul Mehta MD, a student of Jean F. Dumon MD, used a Nd-YAG (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet; Nd:Y3Al5O12) Laser, placed through a bronchoscope, in an anesthetized patient to relieve an airway obstruction in a patient with squamous cell cancer of the lung. With the  initiation  of  the  Lung  Transplantation  program at the CCF in 1990 the portfolio of work expanded to include the various complications that can occur after lung transplantation. Cleveland Clinic was the first institution to introduce successful management of airway dehiscence with temporary placement of uncovered self-expanding metallic stents (1).\nThe invention  of  Radial  Probe  Endobronchial\nUltrasound and later Convex Probe Endobronchial Ultrasound resulted in major growth in the department secondary to the ability to stage lung cancer as well as diagnose various lung diseases (2). Despite this new technology, people still had difficulty sampling peripheral lung lesions. This led to the development of electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy. The Cleveland Clinic was the first center in North America to perform electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy. The prospective study that was conducted helped to validate and bring acceptance of the technology (3).\nSimilarly, the Cleveland Clinic has contributed to the development and clinical acceptance of intra-bronchial valves to assist in the treatment of emphysema patients who need lung reduction surgery as well as thermoplasty for the treatment of severe persistent asthma (4,5).\nFrom its inception the Interventional Pulmonary group has practiced in a multidisciplinary fashion including Anesthesiology, Thoracic surgery, Pathology, Radiology as well as Radiation Oncology. The following are the clinical review of the Interventional Pulmonary Anesthesia Group.",

      "content": "Recent years have shown an increased demand for anesthesiologists to administer anesthesia as a result of the advent of advanced diagnostic bronchoscopy. Although many of these procedures can be accomplished under moderate sedation, there has been a shift towards general anesthesia. The administration of general anesthesia provides an immobile patient, which is often needed by the pulmonologist and results in higher satisfaction for both, the patient and the pulmonologist.\nAt our institution the majority of advanced diagnostic, interventional and therapeutic bronchoscopies generally are done one of three ways:\n(I) General anesthesia with a supraglottic airway (SGA);\n(II) General anesthesia with an endotracheal tube (ETT);\n(III) General anesthesia with rigid bronchoscopy ( Figure 1 ).",

      "title": "Preoperative risk assessment and optimization",
      "content": "Preoperative evaluation as per standard American Society of Anesthesiology guidelines is essential and can help to assess the individual risk and ultimately avoid unexpected intraprocedural complications. Anesthesia providers should focus on procedure related and individualized risk assessment and optimization, instead of wide range testing and assessment. Symptoms and signs related to the primary diagnosis may not be essential for the choice of anesthesia management. For example, obtaining a chest-X-ray in patient with diagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease does not add any specific value to the anesthesia providers. Lung\nfunction testing in these patients might be much more appropriate.\nAirway assessment is essential, as many pathologies, including tumor diseases might narrow the airway. Presence of stridor prior to procedure may alert to the potential narrowing in the upper airway. Luminal narrowing due to tracheal/bronchial intraluminal or extraluminal compression not only makes airway management difficult or maybe even impossible, but it can also lead to ventilatory difficulties (6). A pre-procedural computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might help to assess the airway, but should be performed in a timely manner. Upper airway diseases can change quickly and therefore, any scan might not represent the current state of the airway.\nFor decades, regular and broad laboratory testing was considered the standard of care. However, there is clearly insufficient evidence to identify explicit decision parameters or rules for ordering preoperative tests on the basis of specific clinical characteristics (7,8). Consequently, not least due to financial considerations, laboratory testing should be individualized and focus on relevant testing only. At Cleveland Clinic, we mostly focus on laboratory testing as reported in Table 1 .",

      "title": "Induction of anesthesia and airway management",
      "content": "The routine uses of benzodiazepines and opioids pre procedurally are generally not warranted unless the patient has significant anxiety or pain. One peripheral intravenous line  is  usually  sufficient.  Invasive  monitoring  can  be considered if the patient has significant comorbidities. After  application  of  monitors  and  preoxygenation\n(target FetO 2 â‰¥ 0.8), the patient is placed under general anesthesia. Induction agents are at the discretion of the anesthesiologist. Propofol, and lidocaine is commonly used. Bronchoscopy is a stimulating but not a painful procedure thus induction and intraoperative doses of opioids are generally not required.\nDuring bronchoscopic procedures, the airway is shared between the anesthesiologist and pulmonologist. The type of airway device used depends on the procedure as well as patient factors. The majority of interventional bronchoscopic procedures performed at our institution are accomplished using a SGA. Our preference is the i-gel (Intersurgical LTD, Berkshire UK) in adequate size ( Figure 2 ). The larger lumen of the i-gel can accommodate the bigger scopes that are used. If an ETT is used, the internal diameter should be above 8.5 or 9 mm to accommodate the larger bronchoscopy scopes and allow simultaneous ventilation. A swivel adaptor is attached to the ETT to enable simultaneous ventilation\nand bronchoscopy ( Figure 3 ).\nMuscle paralysis with a non-depolarizing agent like rocuronium is commonly used in all patients undergoing general anesthesia. Although, SGA placement itself doesn't need muscle paralysis, paralyzed vocal cords in adduction position facilitates bronchoscopy. Furthermore, muscle paralysis eliminates the risk of coughing and patient's movements during the procedure.\nWhen rigid bronchoscopy is utilized, the patient is placed under general anesthesia with muscle paralysis. Once muscle relaxation has taken effect, the patient's airway is  handed over to the interventional pulmonologist for insertion of the rigid bronchoscope. Once the scope passes the vocal cords, the anesthesia circuit is connected to the side port of the rigid bronchoscope to initiate ventilation. Significant circuit leak is expected due to the open system nature of rigid bronchoscope. A throat pack made of saline soaked gauze can be inserted around scope.

      "title": "Maintenance of anesthesia",
      "content": "General anesthesia is maintained with a total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) regiment using a continuous propofol infusion. This is preferred to volatile anesthetics as the  frequent  suctioning  as  well  as  manipulation  of bronchoscopes in and out of patients' airway inevitably interrupts the delivery of inhalational anesthesia. This results in an inconsistent delivery of the anesthetic to the patient and the potential of intraoperative recall. Secondly, contamination of the operation room from the inhalational anesthesia occurs due to the frequency of leakage. This level of gas leak is worse with rigid bronchoscope than flexible bronchoscopy. When TIVA is used, the integrity of intravenous access should be monitored closely and the Bispectral index monitor is routinely used to monitor the depth of anesthesia (9,10).\nCircuit leakage is a common challenge with bronchoscopic procedures. Other than the maneuvers mentioned above, sometime mechanical ventilation needs to be substituted by manual bag ventilation. Alternatively, intermittent apnea can be utilized, however, this technique mandates close monitoring of patient's vital signs. We maintain our patients on 100% oxygen due to the inconsistent ventilation\nand frequent leaks.\nOther than with rigid bronchoscopy, the use of dexamethasone on most bronchoscopic procedures to decrease airway swelling is controversial and variable in practice.",

      "content": "Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) TBNA is an advanced diagnostic bronchoscopy technique used for the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) TBNA is now used to detect and sample mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy as an outpatient procedure, eliminating the need for invasive mediastinoscopy and subsequent hospital admission. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) TBNA involves the use of a flexible bronchoscope which also has a linear array ultrasound probe incorporated. This allows the pulmonologist to perform visualization and real time directed needle aspiration of mediastinal lymph nodes and peribronchial lesions. The tissue confirmation obtained by Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) is critical for the appropriate staging and detection of the histological type of cancer which can then guide treatment.\nInitially, pulmonologists used moderate sedation for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) exams, but evolving practice now favors general anesthesia (11,12). However the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) procedures can be long, requiring a relatively immobile patient and precise positioning, especially for smaller sized nodes or lesions in close proximity to blood vessels. The Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscope itself is of larger diameter than traditional bronchoscopes. For this reason, procedures are generally not well tolerated by patients under moderate sedation (9).\nThe pulmonologist in our institution prefer an SGA as it  allows them access to the entire tracheobronchial tree and mediastinal lymph nodes which may be higher\nup in the trachea. If an ETT is to be used, it is generally placed shallow in the trachea for the same reason. Muscle relaxation is obligatorily used for these procedures as coughing can result in movement of the mediastinum which may lead to difficulty obtaining an adequate view of the lymph node, inaccurate insertion of the needle and potential injury to mediastinal major vessels (11). Muscle relaxation may make sampling of small paratracheal nodes easier and may decrease the number of sampling attempts and thus shortening the procedure (9).\nInitially the airway is examined using the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) scope. Then the ultrasound is used to perform ultrasound examination and to guide transbronchial aspiration. The bronchoscope has Doppler capabilities allowing detection and avoidance of mediastina blood vessels. Two screens are available, one to show the fiber optic image of the airway and one to display the corresponding ultrasound image. Generally, lymph nodes greater than 0.5 mm are biopsied. Samples are evaluated there in the bronchoscopy suite by rapid on-site pathology evaluation. This allows verification of adequate samples and preliminary diagnosis (11).\nPotential complications of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) TBNA are rare but can include pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, bleeding, laryngospasm, bronchospasm and the other complications of general anesthesia. Key points regarding anesthesia for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) TBNA are highlighted in Table 2 .",

The major causes of morbidity and mortality are total airway collapse or severe respiratory and cardiovascular complications after induction of anesthesia. All patients with mediastinal masses should be treated with extreme caution, even if asymptomatic.\nPatients  with  mediastinal  masses  present  to  the bronchoscopy suite for palliative stenting to relieve compression symptoms or for tumor debulking. The anterior  mediastinum is  comprised  of  the  sternum anteriorly, the thoracic inlet superiorly, the diaphragm inferiorly and the heart and great vessels posteriorly. Anterior mediastinal masses generally originate from thymomas, lymphomas, teratomas, germ cell tumors, metastatic lesions bronchogenic masses, thyroid tissue or mesenchymal, endocrine and vascular neoplasms (17).

Symptoms depend on the structures that are being compressed. If the trachea and bronchi are compressed the patient will present with cough and dyspnea. If the superior vena cava (SVC) is compressed, the patient may have SVC syndrome. Compression of the esophagus will present with dysphagia whereas recurrent laryngeal nerve compression will present with hoarseness. If  the  heart  is  compressed  or  if  there  is  effusion  or tamponade the patient may complain of syncope or postural symptoms.

SVC syndrome may present with plethora of head and neck and jugular venous distention (JVD). A pericardial effusion or tamponade may also present with a JVD.\nImaging should include CT scan of the chest, chest X-ray and echocardiogram if heart is involved.

      "title": "Anesthetic considerations for mediastinal masses",
      "content": "Patients  with  mediastinal  masses  presenting  to  the bronchoscopy suite are generally symptomatic and need stents placed or tumor debulking to alleviate their symptoms. Patients may present without symptoms of respiratory obstruction; however, induction of general anesthesia can precipitate obstructive symptoms (18). Changing position from sitting to supine has been known to worsen compressive symptoms (19,20). If symptoms are worse in the supine position, all efforts should be made to induce anesthesia in the sitting position.\nBeside  of  airway  collapse,  other  potential  acute complications  include:  SVC  obstruction,  cardiac tamponade, obstruction to pulmonary artery flow and direct compression of heart (13,21). As a result, strong consideration should be given to placement of a preinduction arterial line. If SVC syndrome is suspected, placement of a lower extremity intravenous line should be considered.\nDuring  spontaneous  ventilation,  the  normal transpulmonary pressure gradient distends the airways and helps to maintain patent airways even in the presence of extrinsic compression. When this distending pressure is\nlost with the initiation of positive pressure ventilation, the muscles of the chest wall and bronchi relax. Adding to this effect is the bronchial smooth muscle relaxation, decreasing airway size, which occurs with inhalational anesthetic and neuromuscular blockade. There is also a reduction in thoracic volume as a result of cephalad displacement of the paralyzed diaphragm after neuromuscular blockade. The decrease in the size of the airways enhances the effect of extrinsic compression (18,19,21,22). Even without use of neuromuscular blockade, the loss of transpulmonary pressure gradient with positive pressure ventilation can lead to complete obstruction. Thus, difficulty ventilating or major airway obstruction in patients with mediastinal masses  can  occur  during  induction,  maintenance, positioning or emergence of anesthesia. Due to this potential of complete airway collapse with positive pressure ventilation, maintenance of spontaneous ventilation is of the utmost importance. Awake fiberoptic intubation with the maintenance of spontaneous ventilation should be strongly considered (18,19,21-24). Alternatively, an inhaled induction with volatile anesthesia maintaining spontaneous ventilation with subsequent intubation can be performed. Inhalational anesthesia, ketamine and dexmedetomidine are all good options as they do not ablate respiratory drive. General anesthesia with spontaneous ventilation may be maintained with an inhalational agent or with ketamine or dexmedetomidine infusion (9,25). Ketamine may be safer than inhalational anesthetic with spontaneous respirations as inhalational agents cause a decrease in bronchial wall tone whereas ketamine appears to maintain intercostal and chest wall tone better than inhalational agents (10).\nRigid bronchoscopy may be preferable over endotracheal intubation. The rigid bronchoscope, when placed allows relief  of  compression  and  may  be  preferable  for  the placement of stents. Placement of a rigid bronchoscope is  highly stimulating and may be difficult to place in a spontaneously breathing patient. For rigid bronchoscope placement, sufficient topicalization and deep sedation/ general anesthesia with maintenance of spontaneous ventilation is required. If airway collapse occurs, the\nTable 3 Mediastinal mass severity (17)\nLow risk-asymptomatic/mildly symptomatic without postural symptoms or radiographic evidence of significant compression\nIntermediate risk-mild-mod symptoms, <50% tracheal compression\nHigh risk-severe symptoms, tracheal compression >50% or tracheal compression with bronchial compression, superior vena cava syndrome, pericardial effusion\nanesthesiologist should plan for rapid awakening, return of spontaneous ventilation, shifting to rescue position either sitting upright, lateral decubitus or prone. This position needs be determined pre operatively. Also, rapid placement of rigid bronchoscope for ventilation, placed beyond obstruction may be used in the event of complete airway collapse. There may be some consideration for cardiopulmonary bypass if complete airway obstruction is to occur, and should be discussed and arranged pre operatively.\nPatients with obstructive airway symptoms, whether extrinsic  or  intrinsic,  have  been  successfully  treated with airway stenting. This allows relief of symptoms for palliative reasons, as a permanent cure or temporary relief of symptoms before radiation treatment is initiated to shrink tumor size (26-29).

Patients who have persistent tracheal stenosis or malacia have different options for management of their disease, but surgical resection and reconstruction of the diseased area is the best treatment. However patient factors such as medical comorbidities, or, surgical factors such as the length and areas of stenosis may exclude the patient from having a surgical correction (30). Other options are stenting or permanent tracheostomy. Potential complications of stenting includes stent migration, mucus plugging and granulation tissue formation (31). Tracheostomy is thus often favorable over stenting. The Montgomery T tube was first described over 40 years ago (32). It consists of an uncuffed silicone T-tube that has its long limb in the trachea and its short limb projecting through the tracheostomy stoma. Thus, it has an inferior limb, a superior limb and an anterior limb projecting from the tracheostomy site (33). T-tubes act as stents to maintain airway patency in patients with airway\ncollapse, extrinsic compression, and stenosis or in a post laryngotracheal reconstruction/ healing phase (34). It acts as both a tracheostomy and a stent. It is superior to stenting in that it has decreased rates of migration, allows the ability to suction and the facility to open the cap which allows for an emergency airway should the upper limb become occluded. It is also advantageous over traditional tracheostomy in that it preserves phonation and is cosmetically more appealing. Thus T-tubes are an excellent permanent solution to patients with tracheal stenosis not amenable to surgical reconstruction (35,36).",

Once  the  patient  is  asleep and spontaneous breathing stopped, positive pressure ventilation is initiated. If there is excessive leakage from the nose and mouth, this can be alleviated by pinching the nose and lips shut. Although positive pressure ventilation is  not 100% effective with this method as the T-tube is uncuffed, it is generally sufficient for a short period of time. Sometimes the placement of a SGA mouth with its connector end capped off, seals the proximal end of the T-tube and decreases leakage through the mouth.

      "title": "Airway hemorrhage/hemoptysis",
      "content": "Airway hemorrhage is a constant challenge faced by the anesthesiologists and the interventional pulmonologists. It may range from clinic non-significant mucosal bleeding to life threatening massive bleeding. The definition of massive hemoptysis varies from 100 to 1,000 mL over a 24-hour period. Keep in mind, that the tracheobronchial tree has a dead space of approximately 150 mL (38-40). Gas exchange impairment from the accumulation of blood in airway is  more life threatening than blood loss itself. Patients are more likely to die from asphyxia than from potential hemorrhagic shock.\nAirway hemorrhage can be broadly divided into proximal airway bleeding and distal airway bleeding. Proximal airway bleeding is the bleeding from the trachea, main stem bronchi, and proximal lobar bronchi. The distal bleeding is the bleeding from the rest of the bronchial tree, where the bronchoscope may not always be able to reach.\nIt  is  common  for  a  small  amount  of  bleeding  to occur during regular bronchoscopic procedures. The bronchoscopic interventions to control such bleeding include balloon tamponade, iced saline lavage, topical vasoconstrictor or coagulant application, laser therapy and electrocautery (41-45).\nTherapeutic bronchoscopies have significantly higher risk of bleeding than diagnostic bronchoscopies (46). Among the therapeutic bronchoscopic techniques, transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLBs) is an independent risk factor. Clinically moderate to severe bleeding was reported in about 1.1-2.8%\nof patients undergoing TBLB. The highest risk of bleeding has been reported after cryobiopsies of lung parenchyma, a technique which allows for a higher diagnostic performance in interstitial lung disease (47,48). Compared to TBLB, bronchoalveolar lavage and Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA are considered safe, even in severely thrombocytopenic patients, or patients taking clopidogrel (49).\nThe vascularization of the tissue sampled is another significant risk factor for bleeding. Biopsies of hypervascularized tumors (especially carcinoids), inflammatory tissue or metastasis (e.g., renal cancers or thyroid cancers) are associated with a higher rate of clinically significant bleeding (50). Accidental biopsy of vascular abnormalities in patients with bronchiectasis or pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm may cause massive iatrogenic bleeding (51,52). Some hypertrophic dysplastic arteries running in the bronchial submucosa may appear as a non-pulsating endobronchial lesion (53).\nPatient-related bleeding risk factors are complicated and should be evaluated. It is  not  unusual  to  have patients presenting to bronchoscopic suites already on antithrombotic medication perioperatively. Acetylsalicylic acid has not been shown to increase the risk of bleeding in patients undergoing TBLB, while clopidogrel should be  held  for  7-10  days  before  performing  invasive bronchoscopic interventions (54). Despite its extreme rarity, massive bleeding does occur and anesthesiologists need to be familiar with the risk factors and the related prophylactic measures (9,55).\nWhen a patient presents with hemoptysis for diagnostic or therapeutic bronchoscopy, it is of paramount importance to protect the nonbleeding lung if the bleeding is still ongoing. If blood spills into the intact lung, the gas exchange will be further compromised. Therefore, a patient should be positioned accordingly to prevent contamination of  the  non-bleeding lung, i.e., a patient with a right lung bleeding should be placed in the right-side down decubitus position, whereas a patient whose left lung is bleeding should be placed in the left-side down decubitus position (56). Interventional radiology, thoracic surgeon and extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) team should be promptly notified.\nAfter  positioning,  the  anesthesiologists  need  to promptly secure a patent airway. In terms of lung isolation, double lumen tube insertion has some shortcomings. Each of the double lumen tubes' lumens has a much smaller internal diameter compared to a large bore single lumen endotracheal tube. This limits passage of the therapeutic\nbronchoscope (57,58). Therefore, a large bore single lumen tube (size 8 or greater, if feasible) combined with a bronchial blocker is a preferred measure (59,60).\nIf  the  hemorrhagic source is at the proximal airway, then a rigid bronchoscope is often chosen by interventional pulmonologist (61). It can not only be therapeutic at controlling bleeding by providing a tamponade effect but may also facilitate ventilation by allowing evacuation of large amounts of blood (62). ECMO can be utilized as\nthe last resort when severe refractory hypoxia threatens patient's life (63). Once patient is stabilized, bronchial artery embolization or thoracic surgery can be considered (64,65).  Key  points  for  the  management  of  airway hemorrhage are listed in Table 5 .",

      "title": "Airway stents",
      "content": "Airway stents can effectively restore the central airway patency, especially when no other therapeutic options are available (66,67). The indications for airway stenting are summarized in Table 6 .  Anatomically, airway stenting is  most commonly performed in the trachea, main stem bronchi, or the bronchus intermedius. Airway stenting is  often  utilized  in  combination  with  other  common endobronchial interventions, e.g.,  balloon  dilation ( Figure 7 ),  electrocautery, laser, argon plasma coagulation etc. (68).\nSilicone and metallic stents are the most common material types. Silicone is a synthetic material created from silicone elastomers or polydimethylsiloxane, with various degrees of firmness and flexibility (69). Silicone stents can be easily modified by cutting a portion of the stent, allowing customization to the airway anatomy prior to deployment. These stents have the advantage of ease of  placement, adjustment and removal with low rates of trauma and perforation. The design of the tube also prevents tumor growth into the lumen. Disadvantages of silicone stents include a higher rate of stent migration. Silicone stents also block the normal bronchial wall mucociliary elevator mechanism and can lead to more sputum plugging (70-72). They are comparatively less expensive, easier to remove, and have a long record of safety. The three most common silicone stents are the Montgomery T-tube, the tubular stent and the Y-stent. Most of the time they require a rigid bronchoscope to deploy, which necessitates different anesthesia management",

      "title": "Table 5 Airway hemorrhage key points",
      "content": "Airway hemorrhage is more likely to cause death from asphyxiation than blood loss\nProtection of the non-bleeding lung is of the utmost importance, thus the patient should be placed with the bleeding side down and the airway secured with a large endotracheal either sitting at trachea with a bronchial blocker or sitting at non-bleeding main bronchus. Double lumen tube is not routinely used due to the difficulty to accommodate the therapeutic bronchoscope\nControl of airway hemorrhage may be attempted with intervention via flexible or rigid bronchoscopy\nIn the event that we are unable to control airway hemorrhage, bronchial artery embolization, surgery or Extra corporeal membrane oxygenation may be considered\ncompared to metallic stents (73)\nSelf-expanding metal stents (SEMS) are metal mesh stents  which  are  compacted  into  an  introducer  for deployment. Once deployed, the stent opens to expand and tightly fit into the airway. They may be placed under local anesthesia using flexible bronchoscopy or general anesthesia using flexible or rigid bronchoscopy. Because of the snug fit and rapid rate of epithelialization in the airway, migration rates  are  lower,  however further adjustment or stent removal may be more difficult. SEMS have a higher rate of trauma, including pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, infection, vascular and airway damage as well as bleeding. The SEMS do not block the normal bronchial wall mucociliary elevator mechanism, thus mucus plugging is less of a problem. Tumor and granulation tissue can grow through non covered metal stents and re-occlude the airway (74). This is less of an issue with 'covered' SEMS, which are now available.\nThree decades have passed since the modern airway stents were developed in 1980s. Interestingly, the practice pattern of metallic stent deployment has had fluctuated more dramatically than that of silicone stents (75). Proceduralists witnessed the initial rapid popularity of metallic stents despite the caution advised by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2005 regarding its usage for benign airway disease (76). However, most recently a resurgence of metallic stents use has surfaced due to both technological advancements and better post stenting care (77).\nStents are generally placed for symptomatic central airway obstruction, e.g., airway stenosis or for impairment of the airway integrity, e.g., post lung transplant dehiscence, fistula, etc. (9) ( Figure 8 ).  Patients with a stenotic airway should have a detailed history of airway compromise. It is not uncommon that many of the patients need multiple sequential therapies. The documents of previous general anesthesia and intraoperative airway management can be used as important references to formulate anesthetic plan and anticipate any potential intraoperative and immediate postoperative airway complications. Lung transplant patients may often have other significant comorbidities and present more anesthetic challenges.\nGeneral anesthesia is often performed as it not only provides a comfortable and amnestic experience for the patient but ensures better operating conditions for the pulmonologist. More importantly, unexpected patient movement during stent deployment can lead to unwanted displacement. If flexible bronchoscopy is planned, either SGA or large-bore ETT can be used with general anesthesia and muscle relaxation (78). When silicone stents\nare chosen, it is not uncommon that rigid bronchoscope is utilized for deployment (61,79).\nIn certain situation such as trachea esophageal fistula (TEF) or bronchial wall dehiscence, it may be prudent to avoid positive pressure ventilation. With regards to a TEF, the key anesthetic concerns involve risk of pulmonary aspiration, insufflation of the stomach and hypoxemia and hypercarbia due to loss of tidal volume through the TEF into the stomach. It is therefore important to maintain spontaneous ventilation. Both dexmedetomidine and inhalational anesthetics are good choices as have no significant respiratory depression (80). Meanwhile, in order to minimize patient's cough, the interventional pulmonologist may judiciously spray lidocaine on the vocal cords and trachea through the bronchoscope.\nVigilance and close communication with interventional pulmonologist are of paramount importance. Compared to  the  other  procedures not involving airway, airway stenting requires anesthesiologist's constant adjustment to optimize patient's oxygenation and ventilation. Most importantly, anesthesiologists need to be aware of the rare but potentially lethal complications, specifically massive airway hemorrhage, airway rupture and airway fire when cautery and lasers are used. If the risk of complete airway compromise is suspected, it is prudent to proceed with a multidisciplinary approach with thoracic surgeon and or ECMO stand by or already in place.",

      "title": "Anesthesia for bronchoscopic lung volume reduction valves",
      "content": "Emphysema is characterized by loss of elastic recoil from destruction of alveolar walls and permanent enlargement of airspaces distal to the terminal bronchioles. Air trapping, flattening of the diaphragm and remodeling of the chest to a barrel shaped configuration contribute to increased work of breathing and symptoms of dyspnea.\nWhile medical management with bronchodilators, corticosteroids and oxygen supplementation has been the mainstay of treatment, surgical treatment has emerged as an alternative for patients whose symptoms are refractory to medical therapy. Lung volume reduction surgery typically employs resection of emphysematous portions of the lung to decrease hyperinflation and improve elastic recoil. As morbidity remains high with open or thoracoscopic surgical intervention, interest in viable alternative minimally invasive techniques led to the development of bronchoscopic lung\nvolume reduction techniques.\nCurrently the United States FDA has approved therapies to include bronchoscopic placement of the duckbill shaped Zephyr Endobronchial Valve and the umbrella shaped Spiration Endobronchial Valve (81,82). The former was approved in July 2018 and the latter was approved in December 2018. Their use is limited by the fact that most insurance companies in the United States still  consider their use as 'investigational' and do not reimburse their placement without pre-authorization. They have also approved these valves to treat patients with persistent air leaks as studies have demonstrated efficacy in treating both Alveolar-pleural fistulas as well as Bronchopleural fistulas (83).\nIn  general,  our  pulmonologists  prefer  that  these patients  are  intubated.  Patients  can  become  acutely dyspneic if positioned supine and frequently benefit from preoxygenation and induction of anesthesia while seated in the recumbent position. Post induction patients can be repositioned supine for intubation. With regards to ventilator management, patients often need longer exhalation times to avoid air trapping. Additionally, application of excessive positive end expiratory pressures, light  anesthesia  and  large  tidal  volumes  are  avoided as  these  can  increase  pulmonary  vascular  resistance worsening right ventricular function.",
