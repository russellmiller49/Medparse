The /uniFB01 rst prototypes incorporated an outer diameter of 5 mm with the ability to provide 180 and 120 degrees of /uniFB02 exion and extension, respectively. Since the initial unveiling of the FB, revisions have been made to both bronchoscope design and maneuverability for PPN evaluation; however, aside from small improvements to outer diameter size and adoption of digital imaging, little substantive change has been made. 2\nThe initial reported diagnostic yield of FB paired with /uniFB02 uoroscopic guidance when sampling pulmonary nodules measuring less than 2 cm was reported to be up to 34%. 3 Over the past 20 years, new technologies have been introduced to assist with improving diagnostic performance of bronchoscopy for pulmonary nodules. Electromagnetic navigation (EMN), virtual bronchoscopy, radial endobronchial ultrasound (rEBUS), guide sheaths, and advances in peripheral sampling tools have emerged in hopes of optimizing yield with a reported diagnostic yield of 70% regardless of which modality was used. These initial reported yields resulted in the most recent American College of Chest Physicians guidelines on nodule treatment recommending the use of guided bronchoscopy with modalities such as EMN or\nrEBUS. 3 However, more recent prospective and randomized trial data have shown that the diagnostic accuracies of EMN and rEBUS approach only 50%, and an analysis of a large quality improvement registry reported a diagnostic yield of guided bronchoscopy, using EMN, of only 38.5%, which is nearly identical to the reported yields of decades ago, using only conventional bronchoscopy and /uniFB02 uoroscopy alone. 3,4\nAs new technologies have been introduced there have been limited comparative data between the different modalities. A recent randomized controlled trial comparing the diagnostic yield of a thin bronchoscope and rEBUS with standard bronchoscopy and /uniFB02 uoroscopy in PPN lesions (mean diameter, 31.2 mm) showed the diagnostic yield of rEBUS to be 49% and that of /uniFB02 uoroscopy to be 34%. 5 In addition, a prospective observational trial assessing the performance of a bronchial genomic classi /uniFB01 er reported diagnostic yields of peripheral bronchoscopy with all modalities at 57%. 6 These studies have highlighted the critical importance of randomized and comparative data to evaluate new technologies in order to approximately assess clinical usefulness.\nNewer developments in robotic assisted technologies have led to the introduction of robotic bronchoscopy (RB). 7 These novel devices may allow bronchoscopists to more precisely maneuver into the periphery of the lungs with greater stability and accuracy; this is done by advancing further into the lung periphery by generation count and insertion depth, compared with conventional bronchoscopy, despite having scope outer diameters of similar sizes. 8\nLimited data currently exist regarding the ef /uniFB01 cacy of RB, and no comparative data exist comparing RB with either EMN or rEBUS. 9,10 We report here the results of a randomized controlled trial of RB vs EMN vs rEBUS with an ultrathin bronchoscope (UTB-rEBUS) in a cadaveric model to evaluate pulmonary nodules measuring less than 2 cm.",

      "content": "Before study implementation a series of cadaveric experiments were performed to validate the use of UTB-rEBUS and EMN in this study. First, validation of the rEBUS system was needed to ensure that the nodule implants used in this study would produce reliable ultrasound images consistent with standard rEBUS imaging. Second, EMN room mapping is suggested by the manufacturer to minimize electromagnetic interference to ensure that there is no discernible electromagnetic interference to offset the system ' s ability to localize lesions. Internal study validation was needed and performed because industry methods could not be used during this study.\nDuring the validation phase, two cadavers were prepared and a total of 10 nodules were placed in an endobronchial location to allow for visual con /uniFB01 rmation during the validation phase of EMN and radial Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) in this study. The placement of the validation nodules was performed by an independent proceduralist who was not involved in the navigation validation procedures discussed below.\nThe procedure room was then con /uniFB01 gured under the same map that was used on the days the index study procedures were performed. Cadaver positioning, navigation equipment, bronchoscopy equipment, and /uniFB02 uoroscope positioning were all marked with colored tape on the /uniFB02 oor to allow for precise repositioning during all procedures during the validation phase in the same room and layout that the study was ultimately performed in. After the cadaver was prepared, CT imaging was performed followed by EMN planning. Two bronchoscopists blinded to the initial placement of the nodules were asked to navigate with the EMN system to all 10 nodules. All nodules were localized by EMN, and these locations were all con /uniFB01 rmed by visual bronchoscopy. This portion of the experiment provided robust validation that the room map used in the study did not produce any discernible electromagnetic interference to limit the ability of the EMN system to localize lesions.\nTo validate the rEBUS portion, after localization and visual con /uniFB01 rmation of all lesions by EMN, the radial probe was passed through the working channel of the bronchoscope. All lesions were identi /uniFB01 ed by standard concentric rEBUS imaging (Fig 1).\nThe initial phase of this study con /uniFB01 rmed that EMN appropriately localized all lesions and that radial Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) images were all consistent with concentric imaging, validating the use and accuracy of both technologies in this setting.",

Intubation was followed by bilateral placement of a combination of large-bore surgical and 14F pigtail chest tubes and lung in /uniFB02 ation. To emulate PPNs, pseudotumors were prepared with animal protein and iodinated contrast visible by rEBUS and chest CT imaging. After preparation, each cadaver underwent CT imaging to allow planning of peripheral target placements of the pseudotumors, using a /uniFB02 oor-mounted system with DynaCT and guidance software (Artis zeego SW VD11C; Siemens Inc.). The nonintervention team selected target PPN placement locations to achieve a distribution of nodules in either the peripheral or mid-lung zones across all lobes. Four to six nodules were placed percutaneously in separate, distinct lobes, using a transthoracic needle under /uniFB02 uoroscopic guidance. Eighty percent of the nodules were placed in the periphery, de /uniFB01 ned as the outer one-third of the lung, with the goal of PPN target lesions measuring approximately 15 mm in each cadaver. After PPN target deployment, a second CT scan was performed (1-mm slice thickness with 5-mm overlap) to con /uniFB01 rm nodule size and location and to select four PPNs for targeting. The same scan was then used for procedural planning of EMN and RB navigation as well as for guidance review before and during UTB-rEBUS to ensure image consistency across all three platforms.",

At the start of each day, the study team prepared a single cadaver as delineated in the section ' Peripheral Nodule Model. ' The nonintervention team selected four nodules (from a total of four to six per cadaver) before procedure initiation. Proceduralists attempted to reach and puncture the same four nodules with each bronchoscopic modality (Fig 2).\nOn each study day, the three guided bronchoscopic procedures were performed on the mechanically ventilated cadaver model by a single proceduralist, with the exception of the third study day, during which two proceduralists alternated in performing the procedures. To limit any virtual mapping navigation bias, all proceduralists began with UTB-rEBUS and were prohibited from using computergenerated virtual navigation mapping preoperatively. Block randomization was used to determine which of the other two modalities, EMN and RB, would be performed second and third.\n]\nProceduralists were prohibited from using rEBUS for navigational assistance during EMN or RB procedures.\nUsing each bronchoscopic modality, proceduralists could perform up to three separate and consecutive attempts to reach and puncture each nodule via needle advancement. Fluoroscopic guidance was used with all three modalities to assist with target localization before needle puncture. After each independent navigation and needle advancement, the scope was stabilized and cone-beam CT images were acquired with the proceduralist blinded to the image /uniFB01 ndings.\nLocalization of the nodule was de /uniFB01 ned as successful if the proceduralist had suf /uniFB01 cient con /uniFB01 dence to attempt a needle puncture pass after nodule visibility through rEBUS in the UTB arm or the virtual target was reached in either the EMN or RB arm. If no needle pass was attempted because of inability to suf /uniFB01 ciently localize the lesion, the attempt was considered a navigation failure. After each needle pass, a nonproceduralist assessor (blinded to the device used and the proceduralist) evaluated the needle-target relationship for all attempted needle passes on cone-beam CT in a limited view magni /uniFB01 ed for nodule and needle placement. The following assessment scheme was used: center, peripheral, distal, adjacent, miss, and no localization (Fig 3A).\nNodule puncture attempts received an assessment of ' center ' when the needle was located within the inner two-thirds of the nodule; an assessment of ' peripheral ' was assigned when the needle was located within the outer one-third of the nodule; an assessment of ' distal ' was used when the needle entered and went through the distal edge of the nodule; ' adjacent ' was de /uniFB01 ned as needle positioning in direct contact with the peripheral edge of the nodule; and ' miss ' was de /uniFB01 ned as a needle positioning without any contact or puncture of the nodule (Figs 3B-3F). Regardless of modality, nodule attempts were terminated after either three consecutive passes to reach the nodule or successful puncture of the nodule.",

      "content": "This trial is the /uniFB01 rst single-blinded prospective randomized trial comparing three peripheral navigation platforms in their ability to aid the bronchoscopist in localization and puncture of small ( < 2 cm) PPN targets. In a human cadaveric model of PPNs, the use of RB with shape-sensing technology signi /uniFB01 cantly increased the ability to localize and precisely puncture PPNs when compared with EMN. In addition to differences in measures of precision, assessment of the secondary end points allowed for novel measures of accuracy when\ncomparing modalities by factoring in the needle-totarget ' miss ' difference, which was lower (more accurate) in the RB procedures. This suggests that additional factors such as catheter size, sampling tools, and navigational software likely play important additional roles in procedural success, which must be further investigated.\nAlthough there have been important and signi /uniFB01 cant efforts aimed at improving the diagnostic yield of PPN biopsy via FB, there remains an insuf /uniFB01 cient ability for the bronchoscopist to reliably and reproducibly achieve clinically meaningful results when attempting to biopsy PPNs. Despite single-center retrospective and registry studies reporting high variability in diagnostic yields, 12-14 mounting pooled and prospective evidence evaluating adjunct technologies such as EMN and rEBUS have failed to show consistent signi /uniFB01 cant improvements in diagnostic yield. 4,5,15 The factors associated with the wide variation in diagnostic yields\nEMN ¼ electromagnetic navigation; PPN ¼ peripheral pulmonary nodule; RB ¼ robotic bronchoscopy; UTB-rEBUS ¼ ultrathin bronchoscopy with radial endobronchial ultrasound.\na Successful PPN localization and puncture de /uniFB01 ned by an assessment of needle-to-nodule localization (grade of center, peripheral, or distal).\nb Successful PPN localization and puncture de /uniFB01 ned by an assessment of needle-to-nodule localization (grade of center, peripheral, distal, or adjacent).\nwhen using adjunct PPN sampling modalities have been reported to include center procedural volumes, 16-18 lesion size, location, and the presence or absence of a bronchus sign. 19,20 In addition, retrospective trials are associated with inherent biases that act as confounders when extrapolating consistent or expected diagnostic outcomes. 21 Additional factors such as CT-to-body divergence, the effect of atelectasis, bleeding, and/or nodule motion may also result in diminished precision seen in ' real-world ' and prospective trials of peripheral FB. 22,23\nThese data suggest that RB may provide the proceduralist with a reproducible improvement in diagnostic yield in the biopsy of PPNs. Although these /uniFB01 ndings are both promising and compelling, they also raise questions regarding which of the known and/or unknown factors associated with PPN diagnostic success are at play.\nThere are limitations of our study related to the cadaveric model employed, which, while anatomically intact, may not be fully generalizable (CT-to-body divergence, the effect of atelectasis, bleeding, and/or nodule motion, etc.) to in vivo procedural interventions. In addition, although the pseudotumors implanted proved to be excellent radiographic targets, they may not be representative of in vivo tumor tissue found in lung nodules. The lack of concurrent use of rEBUS with the navigation platforms may have resulted in lower yields; however, the goal of the study\nwas to independently assess each modality. As discussed in the preclinical testing design, the EMN used in this study suggests mapping of the room to minimize interference. Although industry mapping could not be performed during this study, a robust validation model was performed to show that the mapping in this setting did not impact system accuracy, validating this approach. Another potential limitation in study design was that each proceduralist was allowed a maximum of only three attempts to localize and puncture the target, which may have resulted in lower success rates for all modalities tested, but the direct comparator design of this study equilibrated this factor across all arms.\nThe PRECISION-1 study represents the /uniFB01 rst comparative evaluation of a novel PPN biopsy platform (RB with shape-sensing technology) with existing technology. The results from this study demonstrate that RB may hold unique properties that allow for improved localization and puncture of small PPNs. Although these results are compelling, further studies with prospective multicenter comparative trials are needed to better understand the true diagnostic usefulness of this novel platform and to delineate what obstacles RB may be able to overcome to improve PPN diagnostic yields. Future studies evaluating new technology should consider incorporating combined modality approaches.",
