      "content": "Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided transbronchial needle biopsy was performed using a real-time ultrasound biopsy bronchoscope (XBF-UC260FOL8; Olympus Ltd). A 7.5-MHz linear ultrasound transducer with a maximal penetration of 50 mm was linked to a processor (EU-60; Olympus Ltd). Transbronchial needle biopsies were performed  using  a  dedicated  22-gauge  needle  (NA-201SX; Olympus Ltd). All patients were administered general anesthesia through a laryngeal mask airway. Only the fi  rst two LNs that were sampled in each patient were included in our study. Only LNs that were . 0.5 cm in short-axis diameter on Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) were sampled. A total of two needle passes without suction (TBNCS) and two needle passes with suction (TBNA), applied with a 10-mL syringe, were performed at each LN. Each pass consisted of 20 to 30 needle thrusts within the LN. Patients were randomized using a computer to undergo TBNCS in passes 1 and 3 and TBNA in passes 2 and 4, or vice versa, to control for any 'fi  rst-pass' bias. Passes 1 and 3 were done with one needle and passes 2 and 4 were done with a second needle to prevent cross-contamination. Two slides were prepared from each pass by an on-site cytotechnologist; one slide was stained using the Romanowsky technique, and the other was stained using the Pap technique. Only the initial four passes were included in the anal  ysis; if these passes did not yield adequate material, additional passes were performed at the discretion of the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) operator but were not included in the study.\nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided endobronchial needle biopsy was performed by interventional pulmonologists (R. F. C., F. A. A., M. H. U., D. O., C. A. J., G. A. E., and R. C. M.). Cytology samples were reviewed initially by an on-site cytotechnologist, who assessed their adequacy, diagnosis, and quality. These slides and cell blocks were later reassessed by a single cytopathologist (G. A. S.). Both the cytotechnologist and the cytopathologist were blinded to the technique used to obtain the sample. The fi  nal reading used for analysis was that of the cytopathologist. The following data were also collected from the medical records of each patient: demographics, baseline malignancy, indication for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) (diagnostic, staging, or restaging), history of radiation therapy to the chest, and LNs sampled and their size (as assessed by Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)).\nyield as fi  ne-needle aspiration with fewer traumatic samples. 4-6  A prospective randomized trial comparing endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided needle capillary sampling with EUS-guided needle aspiration (including sampling of mediastinal LNs) revealed no difference in diagnostic yield but lower-quality samples, due to excessive blood, in the aspiration group. 7 To date, however, the use of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided transbronchial needle capillary sampling (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNCS) has not been studied. The purpose of our study was to  compare Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA and Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNCS of mediastinal and hilar LNs in terms of sample adequacy, diagnosis, and quality.",

      "content": "One hundred twenty patients were enrolled in the study. Two patients withdrew consent prior to the biopsy, and the biopsy was cancelled in three other patients. A total of 115 patients and 192 LNs were included in the analysis. The baseline characteristics of patients and LNs are summarized in   Table 1  . Figure 1 shows the adequacy, diagnosis, and quality of  samples  from all  LNs  (N 5 192).  Concordance between Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA and Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNCS was high, and we found no signifi  cant difference between the two procedures in terms of the adequacy, diagnosis, or quality of samples. The percentage of adequate samples was 88% with both techniques ( P 5 .858), with a concordance rate of 83.9% (95% CI, 77.9-88.8). A diagnosis (granulomatous infl  ammation Odds ratio (or) malignancy) was obtained in 36% and 34% of LNs using TBNA and TBNCS, respectively ( P 5 .289), with a concordance rate of 95.8% (95% CI, 92-98.2). A diagnosis of malignancy was obtained in 28% and 26%  of  LNs  using  TBNA  and  TBNCS,  respectively ( P 5 .125), with a concordance rate of 97.9% (95% CI, 94.8-99.4). Assessment of sample quality using Mair's 5  score revealed no poor samples obtained using either technique, 13% and 12% good samples obtained using TBNA and TBNCS, respectively, and 87% and 88% superior samples obtained using TBNA and TBNCS, respectively ( P 5 .724),  with  a  concordance rate of 83.3% (95% CI, 73.3-88.3). Stratifi  ed analysis based on LN size ( ≤ 1  cm vs . 1  cm) revealed that concordance between Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA and Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNCS remained high irrespective of LN  size  and  revealed  no  significant  difference between Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA and Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNCS in terms of the adequacy, diagnosis, and quality of samples (see  e-Appendix  1  for  details).  Additional  sensitivity analysis of patients who had one or two LNs sampled was done to assess bias due to the number of LNs sampled per patient. This analysis showed that the concordance between the two techniques\nremained high, regardless of whether one or two LNs were sampled.

      "content": "Our study showed a very high concordance rate in terms of the adequacy, diagnosis, and quality of samples obtained using Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided transbronchial needle  biopsy  with  and  without  suction.  Because Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided transbronchial needle biopsy has been established as a helpful tool for minimally invasive access to the mediastinum, it is important to evaluate and refi  ne procedural techniques to enhance diagnosis and sample quality.\nData are presented as No. (%) unless indicated otherwise. L 5 left; R 5 right.\nSince Paget 8 fi  rst described fi  ne-needle aspiration (performed on a breast tumor) in 1853, using suction has become a common practice for most pathologists, radiologists  (for  ultrasound-  and  CT  scan-guided biopsies), and gastroenterologists (for EUS). However, the role of suction in fi  ne-needle sampling remains somewhat controversial. Advocates argue that the cellularity  of  the  samples  is  greater  with  suction, whereas opponents believe that suction draws more blood and fl  uid into the sample, thereby diluting it and decreasing its quality. 9 Zajdela  et  al 6   retrospectively compared fi  ne-needle aspiration in 7,877 breast tumors with fine-needle capillary sampling in 635 breast tumors and found no difference in diagnostic yield or  cellularity  but  less  blood  in  samples  obtained without the use of suction. Mair et al 5   also  found no difference in diagnostic yield between conventional fi  ne-needle aspiration and fi  ne-needle capillary\nsampling in a study of 100 superfi  cial masses at various body sites. However, there was a trend toward better-quality samples with capillary sampling.\nAs mentioned previously, the use of fi  ne-needle capillary sampling has been investigated in EUS-guided biopsy, which is more similar to Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided biopsy than breast or superficial biopsies. Wallace et al 7 carried out a prospective randomized trial in which they compared EUS-guided biopsies (including those of  mediastinal  LNs)  obtained  with  and  without suction and found no difference in diagnostic yield. However, they did fi  nd that samples in the suction group were of lower quality because of excessive blood.  Storch  et  al 10   also  prospectively  studied EUS-guided biopsies obtained with and without suction in 53 patients and found no difference between the two procedures in terms of the quality or diagnostic accuracy of samples. Although we found a\nhigh concordance rate between Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA and Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNCS in terms of diagnosis, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNCS did not yield superior-quality samples. Of note, our method of assessing  sample  quality  was  different from that of Wallace et al, 7  and the amount of blood in the samples was only one of fi  ve components that were evaluated (see Mair's score in e-Appendix 1).\nWe  hypothesized  that  when  sampling  smaller  LNs with Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided needle biopsy, the needle would travel a shorter distance within the node and the specimens obtained might have less material if suction were not applied. However, when we compared Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA and Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNCS for LNs ≤ 1  cm and . 1 cm in short-axis diameter, we found no difference in the adequacy, diagnosis, or quality of the samples. Despite traveling a shorter distance with the needle within the LN, suction does not seem to be required to guarantee diagnosis and a high-quality sample.\nThe concordance rate between Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA and Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNCS was higher when slides were stained using the Pap technique and lower when slides were stained using the Romanowsky technique. We believe the  concordance  rate  might  have  been  different because  slides  were  fixed  with  modified  Carnoy solution before Pap staining but were air-dried only before Romanowsky staining. Hence, the RBCs aspirated with TBNA are not lysed when subjected to Romanowsky staining, and obscuring blood can be an issue.\nThe relatively low diagnostic yield documented in  our  study,  especially  for  malignancy  (28%  and 26% using TBNA and TBNCS, respectively), can be explained partially by the fact that only the fi  rst two LNs sampled in each patient were included in this study. This led us to have many normal samples without cancer because we started staging systematically from N3 nodes if the suspected diagnosis was lung cancer. Our reason for including only the fi  rst two LNs for each patient in this study was to reduce the procedure time and risk to participants. Because the analysis was per LN and not per patient, we felt in our study design that it should not infl  uence the results.\nOne limitation of our study was that we did not analyze the quality and number of cells in rinses (ie,  tissues  fl  ushed  from  each  needle  pass  once  the two slides were prepared) obtained using each technique. A large number of cells is required for fl  ow cytometry when non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is suspected, and an adequate number of viable tumor cells is needed for molecular analysis such as epidermal growth factor receptor, anaplastic lymphoma kinase, and  Kirsten  rat  sarcoma  viral  oncogene  homolog mutations, which can help guide treatment of nonsmall cell lung cancer.\nAnother limitation could be related to the number of extensions/retractions of the needle within the LN that we used (20-30). Although there is no evidence regarding the ideal number, some authors could argue that the number we chose was high and could have  led  to  more  bloody  samples,  particularly  with TBNA.\nTo our knowledge, this is the fi  rst randomized controlled study in which Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided transbronchial needle biopsy samples obtained with and without the use of suction were compared. In our randomized study, we found no differences between the two techniques in terms of the adequacy, diagnosis, and quality of samples, regardless of LN size.",
