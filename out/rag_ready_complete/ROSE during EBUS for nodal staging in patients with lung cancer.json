The utility of rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) during endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA) for lymph node staging in lung cancer is still controversial.

ROSE during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for material adequacy showed a low rate of non-diagnostic sampling. There was a high agreement between the on-site and final pathologic evaluation during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA; however immediate diagnosis should be approached with caution.\n(Ann Thorac Surg 2013;95:1695-9) © 2013 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons\nE ndobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA) is a minimally invasive modality for lymph node staging in patients with lung cancer. The pooled sensitivity and specificity is reported to be 85% to 100% and 100%, respectively [1-3]. Moreover, a recent prospective trial showed that Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA has similar diagnostic yield to mediastinoscopy in patients with potentially resectable non-small cell lung cancer [4].\nThe presence of a cytopathologist during the procedure for rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) seemed to reduce futile additional biopsies without loss in diagnos-\ntic yield [5]. The results of a randomized trial that evaluated the utility of ROSE for the diagnosis of adenopathy using TBNA showed that ROSE significantly reduces the number of TBNAs and the complication rate of the bronchoscopy [6]. ROSE during endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) has been reported to achieve high diagnostic yield and it is highly recommended that resources be allocated to it [7-9]. A high concordance rate is reported between cytologic results of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA with ROSE and referenced histologic diagnosis [10]. Furthermore, to confirm the quality of the specimen obtained during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, it is important to apply the samples for several kinds of molecular analysis [11]. However there may be some difficulties in ROSE of aspirates from Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA because of the contamination of background material [12]. In addition, a recent study raised a question about the utility of ROSE for the evaluation of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA sam-\nples because there was no difference for clinical values, including diagnostic yield [13]. The interpretation of ROSE results on Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA samples and its role in nodal staging using Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA in patients with lung cancer remains controversial. This study focused on the correlation between ROSE and final pathologic diagnosis for lymph node staging in patients with lung cancer.",

      "content": "Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA is a minimally invasive and accurate modality for mediastinal lymph node staging in lung cancer. ROSE during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for material adequacy was considered to reduce the rate of non-diagnostic samples; however very few studies have investigated ROSE during the procedure and reported contrary results. The interpretation of the result of ROSE remains unclear. In this study, the non-diagnostic sampling rate of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was only 4.0% and the nodal staging based on ROSE results correlated well with the final results based on\nSensitivity = 96.5% (219/227 cases), specificity = 100% (211/211 cases), and diagnostic accuracy = 98.2% (430/438 cases).\nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA = endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration.\nConcordance = 94.3%, sensitivity = 88.6%, specificity = 100%, negative predictive value = 89.8%.\nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA = endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration; H&E = hematoxylin and eosin.\nPapanicolaou/H&E evaluation. High agreement between the on-site and final cytologic evaluation may be applicable to early therapeutic decisions when ROSE results are positive. Conversely, negative results by ROSE need further cytologic as well as histologic evaluation for accurate diagnosis because there is a substantial falsenegative rate. The false-negative rate of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBUA was 5.7% in this study. These results may suggest that EBUSTBNA is best performed before a confirmed final diagnosis and planned surgical resection.\nThe utility of ROSE during TBNA has been reported. It is reported that at least 5 to 7 TBNA procedures would be needed to achieve a plateau diagnostic yield [17, 18]. ROSEduring TBNA significantly improves the diagnostic yield [19, 20] and also reduces the number of passes necessary for achieving a high diagnostic yield [5, 6]. Similar results have been reported for EUS-FNA, which is performed in a fashion similar to that of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA [8, 9]. Conversely, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA samples are often difficult to interpret because of the quality of the sample. The amount of lymphoid tissue depends not only on the technical aspect but also on cellularity of the lymph node [21]. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA allows the evaluation of smaller lymph nodes than does conventional TBNA; therefore it may result in marginal diagnosis such as a 'suspicious' negative result [21].\nROSE has been used to determine adequacy of EBUSTBNA samples by the presence of normal lymphocytes, especially for non-metastatic lymph nodes. As noted by us and others, ROSE of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA samples could help determine the need to collect additional samples for pathologic diagnosis. To create an algorithmic approach is warranted and may avoid false-negative and falsepositive diagnoses [16, 22, 23]. The results of this study showed no false-positive results for ROSE for the nodal staging in patients with lung cancer. Therefore the result of this study may suggest that ROSE can be used to determine a definitive malignant diagnosis. In contrast, the negative predictive value of ROSE was 89.8% and there were 5.7% false-negative results. Hence cases in which a diagnosis of 'negative for malignancy' is not rendered at on-site interpretation need further pathologic evaluation.\nRapid on-site assessment during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA determines if sampling of target nodes has been achieved. This is important not only for improving the yield but also for improving the skills of the bronchoscopist. ROSE also enables triage of material to secondary investigations (ie, culture, flow cytometry) [14, 22]. Recently, lung cancer is often diagnosed by small biopsied cytologic samples. Conversely, clinical requirement for further classification and detailed biological characteristic analysis is increasing [24]. From this point of view, ROSE is an important part of the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA procedure for tissue diagnosis and staging of lung cancer.\nThe limitation of this study is that this is not a prospective randomized trial. There remains the question about whether we could achieve a low rate of non-diagnostic sampling and high diagnostic yield without ROSE. The feeling of bronchoscopists is that ROSE is an important\nstep to optimize the sampling procedures during EBUSTBNA, but we will need a well-designed controlled study to support this consideration. Another limitation is that only Diff-Quik evaluation was performed for ROSE. Diff-Quik staining is based on a modification of the Wright-Giemsa stain; therefore differentiation between lymphocytes and other cells is relatively easy. Diff-Quik staining does not require ethanol fixation and the samples can be stained rapidly. Conversely, it was reported that false-negative diagnoses were more frequent with the rapid Wright-Giemsa stain than with the rapid Papanicolaou stain for the diagnosis of TBNA aspirates [25]. The sensitivity of ROSE may be improved by the use of rapid Papanicolaou staining. However the high concordance rate for the diagnosis of malignant cells in our current study is promising for ROSE using Diff-Quik staining.\nIn conclusion, ROSE during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for material adequacy showed a very low rate of non-diagnostic sampling. Positive results of ROSE during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA are highly accurate, and the results produced by ROSE may help initiate the treatment process in patients with lung cancer. However negative results produced by ROSE should be interpreted with care. Such results need to be followed with a final pathologic diagnosis because there is a substantial false-negative rate with ROSE.\nWe thank Mr Fumio Horiuchi (Chiba University Hospital) for support of cytologic diagnosis.
