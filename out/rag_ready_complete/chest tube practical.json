Chest tube insertion is frequently performed by interventional radiologists (IRs) due to the advantage of imaging guidance including ultrasound (US), /uniFB02 uoroscopy, and computed tomography (CT) which allow for precise placement not achieved with bedside insertion techniques. Chest tube management is increasingly conducted by IRs, signifying the importance of a greater understanding of chest tube management and troubleshooting, especially for IR trainees. This manuscript is speci /uniFB01 cally tailored for the IR trainees to provide an overview of chest tube management. The practical considerations detailing the entire chest tube process are covered such as indications, technique, relevant anatomy, collection devices, commonly used catheters, postprocedural complications, lytic therapy, and troubleshooting. This guide aims to help the IR trainees feel more con /uniFB01 dent in chest tube placement and periprocedural care.",

      "content": "Chest tube insertion, also known as tube thoracostomy, can be performed for the evacuation of various air and/or /uniFB02 uid collections from the pleural space. Following chest tube placement, evacuation of air and /uniFB02 uid within the pleural cavity allows for lung reexpansion and return to normal ventilatory function. 1 The role of chest tubes in the management of pleural effusions depends on the underlying cause, such as blood (hemothorax), purulent /uniFB02 uid (empyema), and lymphatic /uniFB02 uid (chylothorax). In the setting of hemothorax, the chest tube placement will decompress the pleural cavity, and information provided by /uniFB02 uid appearance and output from the tube can guide the need for blood transfusion, endovascular embolization, or surgical intervention. 2,3\nFollowing cardiothoracic surgeries, chest tubes ensure adequate postoperative drainage of /uniFB02 uid, blood, and air. In instances of multiloculated parapneumonic effusions and empyema, drainage may be slow or inadequate due to /uniFB01 brinous septations. In these situations, an indwelling chest tube can be used to instill intrapleural /uniFB01 brinolytic agents to enhance drainage. 4 For malignant pleural effusions, chest tube drainage provides symptomatic relief and allows for chemical pleurodesis or the obliteration of the space between visceral and parietal pleural layers. Various chemicals such as talc, doxycycline, or bleomycin can be instilled via the chest tube to create adhesion between pleural layers and prevent malignant /uniFB02 uid accumulation. 1 Chest tubes can also be used to drain chylothorax due to thoracic duct injury from trauma or surgery. 2 Resolution of a chylothorax usually entails additional treatment including dietary changes, octreotide, and lymphatic embolization. 5",

The relative contraindications of chest tube placement include a highly loculated pleural effusion, bleeding adhesions can partially obliterate the pleural space creating dif /uniFB01 cult placement of a chest tube into pockets of /uniFB02 uid or gas, which may not be well visualized even with imaging guidance. 2 Chest tube placement is considered a low-risk procedure based on the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) guidelines and can be safely performed with an international normalized ratio (INR) < 3.0 and platelet counts of at least 20,000per μ L. Importantly, most anticoagulants do not need to be withheld as long as the target INR is reached. 6 A recent meta-analysis of over 5,000 patients with uncorrected coagulopathies undergoing either US-guided thoracentesis or chest\ntube placement con /uniFB01 rmed the low risk of bleeding in these procedures. 7 Achest tube should not be inserted at a site with an overlying infection such as cellulitis or a Herpes zoster infection. 2 Inadditiontotheserelativecontraindications,there are certain clinical scenarios in which chest tubes should beavoided, if possible, which are detailed in ► Table 1 .

Modalities such as US or CT are helpful when the tubes need to be inserted into small or dif /uniFB01 cult-to-access collections. 14 US is more commonly used over CT due to its availability, convenience, and lack of ionizing radiation. There are several circumstances in which preprocedural CT imaging is useful such as multiple catheter placements in complex or multifocal collections and complex gas-containing collections. 2 Preprocedural CT can also be considered if there is a need to simultaneously evaluate the concomitant chest disease in the patient. Fluoroscopy is often used in conjunction with US or CT to evaluate the extent of drainable /uniFB02 uid in pleural collections and delineate any /uniFB01 stulous tracts.\nFluoroscopy can be used as a standalone imaging guidance modality for gas or /uniFB02 uid collections large enough that only bony landmarks are needed for initial access.",

      "content": "► Table 2 summarizes commercially available catheters commonly used for chest tube placement and their key features. Catheter shapes are straight with a curved tip, straight with a hooked tip, and pigtail (looped tip). The range of tube diameters is 5 to 40 Fr. Two intraprocedural catheter modi /uniFB01 cations can be performed to enhance certain catheter functions: the manual creation of additional catheter side holes and the removal of the retention string on locking pigtail catheters. Themanualcreationofadditionalcathetersideholesincreases the surface area in contact with the pleural collection, facilitating more ef /uniFB01 cient and effective drainage. Care must be taken to not introduce excessive side holes which may extend across the pleura or into the thoracic soft tissue and result in increased pain or risk of subcutaneous emphysema or cellulitis, respectively. The creation of excessively large side holes decreases the catheter ' s structural integrity which may result in catheter breakage and retained catheter fragments. The use of a 10- to 16-Fr biliary catheter as a chest tube provides additional factory-created side holes. The second potential chest tube modi /uniFB01 cation is the removal of the retention string from the locking pigtail catheter which allows for more ef /uniFB01 -cientcatheterremovalatthebedside.Thisisespeciallyusefulif non-IR clinicians will be performing the catheter removal and pulling the pigtail catheter without the release of the retention string that locks the pigtail. Removal of the retention string before placement may lower the risk of pneumothorax upon tube removal as the catheter does not need to be cut (open to the atmosphere) to release the locking string mechanism.\nAbbreviation: TIPS, transjugular intravascular portosystemic shunt.\nFinally, there is no string to get caught on the lung or pleura upon tube removal, reducing the risk of lung injury. The main drawback associated with removing the retention string on locking pigtail catheters is the increased risk of the catheter falling out inadvertently. There are commercially available nonlocking pigtail catheters that may be used as chest tubes.",

      "title": "Optimal Chest Tube Caliber",
      "content": "The IR physicians need to anticipate a suf /uniFB01 cient chest tube caliber for a pneumothorax or pleural effusion by integrating clinical, drainage, and patient tolerance factors. Smaller caliber chest tubes are less painful and perform noninferior to larger caliber tubes in many clinical settings. 15 However, smaller caliber tubes come with an increased risk of catheter clogging that necessitates exchange for a larger caliber tube, resulting in another procedure for the patient and an increased length of hospitalization. Thus, there is a compromise between greater clinical ef /uniFB01 cacy (larger caliber tube) and less patient discomfort (smaller caliber tube) that should be balanced on a case-by-case basis. In pneumothorax, the size of the visceral pleural air leak and the underlying integrity of the lung parenchyma must be considered\nwhen selecting the correct tube size. A large pneumothorax in patients with either underlying emphysema or bronchopleural /uniFB01 stulae may need a larger caliber (14 -18 Fr) chest tube since greater volumes of air need to be removed from the pleural space to achieve pleural apposition. In contrast, a pneumothorax after a percutaneous needle lung biopsy in a patient without parenchymal lung disease may only require a 10- to 12-Fr chest tube for 1 to 2 days. Similarly, a nonloculated serous pleural effusion may be drained using a 10- to 12-Fr chest tube, whereas a larger bore (14 -28 Fr) chest tube may be considered for effective drainage of a hemothorax. 16\nParapneumonic effusions and empyemas should be initially drained with a larger diameter (14 -18 Fr) chest tube. The use of suction applied to the chest tube, injection of lytic medications, or daily saline /uniFB02 ushes through the chest tube may promote catheter lumen patency and reduce the need for larger caliber chest tubes. 2 When dealing with smaller ( < 10cm diameter) loculated pleural /uniFB02 uid collections, there may not be enough anatomic space for an angled, large caliber chest tube with extended side holes. In these circumstances, a 12- to 16-Fr pigtail catheter has a smaller ' sidehole footprint ' and may be ideal for the limited pleural space available in small loculated collections.",

      "title": "Chest Tube Positioning",
      "content": "In a supine patient, simple pleural /uniFB02 uid collects dependently in the posterior pleural space. Positioning the chest tube within the dependent posterior location allows that /uniFB02 uid to be more effectively removed ( ► Fig. 1 ). The best strategy to accomplish posterior tube placement is to enter the pleural space along the posterior axillary line and orient the needle, guidewire, and chest tube posteriorly. The procedural workspace needed to insert a posterior pleural space chest tube is often improved by rotating the supine patient in a contralateral direction to better visualize a posterolateral entry site. Entry of a chest tube through the lateral chest and aimed posteriorly does not guarantee that the catheter tip will end up in the posterior pleural space to drain pleural /uniFB02 uid. The tip of the chest tube may accidentally reside within the major /uniFB01 ssure or even the anterior pleural space, thus failing to evacuate the pleural effusion. Once the guidewire is adjacent to the spine on the anteroposterior /uniFB02 uoroscopy view, the guidewire should remain close to the spine with an oblique view. A single chest tube is usually effective for parapneumonic effusion or empyema ( ► Fig. 1 ). If the preprocedure CT demonstrates a large pleural effusion with multiple loculations, two chest tubes can promote more ef /uniFB01 cient drainage ( ► Fig. 1 ).\nIn a supine patient, simple pleural gas collects nondependently in the anterior pleural space. A simple pneumothorax is evacuated optimally with the chest tube in the anterior pleural space ( ► Fig. 2 ). This is most likely achieved\nbyaccessing the pleural space along the anterior axillary line or by entering more anteriorly while remaining lateral to the internal thoracic artery and vein. When placing an anterior left chest tube, the operator must con /uniFB01 rmthe position of the pericardium and heart through the use of imaging, particularly in the presence of cardiomegaly and/or pericardial effusion.\nSuboptimal chest tube locations include near the scapula, close to the spine, and into the major /uniFB01 ssure. When placing a chest tube along the posterolateral chest, catheter entry adjacent to the inferior scapula may lead to chest tube dislodgement. Typically, chest tube insertion is performed in the supine position with the ipsilateral upper extremity abducted, displacing the inferior tip of the scapula superiorly. When the patient adducts the upper extremity following the procedure, the inferior tip of the scapula will return to its inferior anatomic position and may move or retract the posterolateral chest tube out of position. Chest tube mispositioning by the scapula is avoided by using a more inferior or lateral entry point relative to the position of the inferior scapula. When a loculated posteromedial pleural effusion requires chest tube drainage, if possible, the catheter trajectory should avoid traversal of the paraspinal muscles and the extreme medial intercostal space. A higher risk of bleeding is associated with crossing the blood vessel-rich paraspinal muscles or with injury to the relatively large intercostal vessels in the medial intercostal space ( ► Fig. 3 ). 17 A supine patient laying directly on a posteromedial chest tube may cause tube kinking and migration andoften leads to increased pain for the patient. With a chest tube positioned in the major /uniFB01 ssure, removal of intrapleural /uniFB02 uid andgas is typically limited. 2 However, there may be rare instances in which a loculated major /uniFB01 ssure collection may\nbe drained by a chest tube ( ► Fig. 2 ). Extrapleural collections can be effectively drained by a chest tube. 18",

The parietal pleura is the most pain-sensitive structure traversed during transthoracic procedures and insuf /uniFB01 cient administration of local anesthesia prior to chest tube placement is often an underoptimized step to limit insertional and postprocedure pain. A short-acting local anesthetic, such as lidocaine 1 or 2%, is often used. Following chest tube insertion, injection of additional long-acting local anesthetic agents, such as bupivacaine 0.25 or 0.5%, can provide extended pain relief following the procedure.",

Seldinger technique allows for the placement of an 18-gauge needle into a /uniFB02 uid or gas pleural collection using image guidance. An 0.035-inch guidewire is inserted through the needle and into the pleural space. The location of the guidewire is imaged using /uniFB02 uoroscopy or CT. If needed, a 5-Fr Kumpe catheter can reposition the guidewire under /uniFB02 uoroscopic guidance for optimal chest tube location. The use of a 21-gauge needle for access into the pleural space is valuable for delicate needle trajectories, near the spleen, and in patients with higher bleeding risks.\nFluid aspiration through the needle provides an early indicator of the nature of the pleural /uniFB02 uid or in the setting of pneumothorax, and aspiration of air provides additional con /uniFB01 rmation of needle placement into the pleural space. The guidewire should move with low resistance across the pleural space, as observed with /uniFB02 uoroscopy. Limited initial guidewire purchase and mobility by /uniFB02 uoroscopy suggests a nonideal location such as entry into a highly loculated pleural space, within the lung parenchyma, or in the extrapleural space. Another needle access entry site for a better intrapleural location should be sought. If the guidewire location is uncertain to be in the pleural space, cone beam CT may be utilized for problem-solving.\nFollowing guidewire placement, the track is serially dilated prior to insertion of the chest tube catheter over a plastic or metal stiffener. After placement, the chest tube is connected to a drainage system. In the setting of pleural effusion, the /uniFB02 uid should spontaneously /uniFB02 owthroughthetube.If /uniFB02 uid only can be aspirated with a syringe, the chest tube may need to be repositioned to improve /uniFB02 ow. In the setting of pneumothorax, bubbling through the chest tube drainage system (CTDS) is expected initially. Following lung reexpansion, continued bubbling through the drainage system indicates an air leak through the visceral pleura (bronchopleural /uniFB01 stula). The catheter should be secured to prevent kinking or dislodgement after clinical and/or imaging con /uniFB01 rmation of appropriate chest tube placement. Suturing should be performed with one or two, nonabsorbable sutures (e.g., 0 silk, 0 PROLENE). A transparent dressing is preferable to allow the insertion site to be visually inspected by nursing staff. Use of the omental tape technique or a FLEXI-TRAK Anchoring Device will provide additional anchor points to the skin, promote chest tube stability, and avoid kinking and excessive tension at the tube insertion site.",

Evidence suggests that the combination of intrapleural tissue plasminogen activator (alteplase) and DNase (dornase alfa, Pulmozyme; Genentech, Inc, South San Francisco, CA) via the chest tube may improve drainage of infected material or retained hemothorax and likely improves the clinical course of patients. This increased drainage is associated with a decreased hospital stay as well as a reduced need for thoracic surgery interventions. 1,24 First-line treatment for retained hemothorax is early video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, but lytic therapy can be considered as an adjunct or alternative treatment, especially in poor surgical candidates. 25 Our institution ' s approach to intrapleural lytic therapy is to administer the combination of alteplase 10 mg and dornase alfa 5 mg via the chest tube and clamp the tube for 2 hours, perform twice a day for 3 days, and stop if there is bleeding from the chest tube.\nFor therapeutic lysis of loculated pleural effusions, there are current procedural terminology (CPT) codes that may be used for billing. CPT code 32561 may be used for the /uniFB01 rst day of the instillation of lytic agents via a chest tube for the\nbreakup of a multiloculated pleural effusion. CPT code 32562 may be used for each subsequent day in which there is the instillation of lytic agents via a chest tube. These CPT codes donotapplytotheinstillation of lytic agents into catheters in other locations, such as the peritoneal cavity. 26",

      "content": "After a chest tube has been placed, the provider may /uniFB01 ndthat the amount of /uniFB02 uid drainage is lower than expected. If this happens, some common and easily resolved issues should be investigated /uniFB01 rst. If the CTDS collection chamber is near full, /uniFB02 uid drainage ceases, and the CTDS should be changed. Another reason for low /uniFB02 uid output from the chest tube is that the chest tube has successfully evacuated the pleural effusion; con /uniFB01 rm with imaging. Occasionally, there may be erroneous low chest tube output entered during a single hospital shift. This is con /uniFB01 rmed if bedside assessment indicates adequate /uniFB02 uid output. If the chest tube collection device has been inadvertently rotated multiple times, either by caregivers or an ambulatory patient, the chest tube or connecting tubing may become twisted and occluded. Occasionally the chest tube is dressed in a fashion that introduces a kink in the tubing, resulting in ineffective drainage. Drainage could also be impeded by a closed stopcock or clave in line with the chest tube, thick secretions or blood clogging the tube, or chest tube displacement. To improve patency in a clogged chest tube, bedside irrigation with sterile saline can be performed daily, followed by catheter exchange under /uniFB02 uoroscopy if issues persist.\nLack of tidal breathing /uniFB02 uctuation in the chest tube or drainage system may indicate successful pleural space drainage which can be identi /uniFB01 ed by imaging. A chest tube kink or disconnection may be the reason for no tidal /uniFB02 uctuation. If the chest tube is occluded with debris or clot, sterile saline irrigation or exchange of the chest tube may be necessary.\nThe presence of subcutaneous emphysema usually indicates ineffective evacuation of pleural gas which migrates into the nearby soft tissues. Exchange for a larger caliber chest tube or placement of an additional chest tube is a potential remedy. Subcutaneous emphysema also may be due to chest tube side holes outside of the pleural space so that pleural gas can exit into soft tissues. If this is the case, exchange and reposition the chest tube so that side holes do not extend across the pleura.\nAir bubbles through the chest tube and CTDS usually occur from an air leak in the lung. Prior to any chest tube managementchanges, always exclude the air bubbles which are from tubing disconnection or a hole in the external chest tube. An increase in suction applied to the chest tube should improve the apposition of pleural surfaces to stop the air leak. If the existing chest tube is of a small caliber or distant from the known lung air leak, chest tube exchange and repositioning should be considered. When a bronchopleural /uniFB01 stula persists despite increased applied suction and other interventions, a trial of water seal can be attempted since suction applied to the chest tube may account for the perpetuation of the pleural air leak.",

      "title": "Chest Tube Removal",
      "content": "The appropriate timing for the removal of chest tubes placed to drain pleural effusions remains a subject of debate. Thresholds for removal range from 200 to 500 mL per day. 1 Higher output thresholds for removal in postoperative patients were associated with higher rates of readmission for recurrent symptomatic pleural effusion, and therefore some authors recommend a lower threshold of 200 mL per day for removal. 14 In addition, the serous-appearing drainage and minimal radiologic evidence of residual /uniFB02 uid are factors favoring chest tube removal. Airspace disease may be confused with residual pleural effusion on a chest radiograph, potentially causing a delay in tube removal when the pleural /uniFB02 uid evacuation is satisfactory. Prior to the removal of a chest tube placed for pneumothorax, the chest tube is usually transitioned from suction to water seal to observe for the development of a chest tube air leak and/or pneumothorax. A water seal trial should be brief to not extend the length of hospital stay. Chest tube removal while on suction is acceptable if removal criteria are met. A chest tube clamping trial for pneumothorax is not always favored since it is an unnecessary step if removal criteria have been met and it adds unnecessary risk for the development of a tension pneumothorax.\nThere are variations in practice regarding chest tube removal techniques. A dose of intravenous narcotic analgesic medication 5 to 10minutes before chest tube removal improves the tolerance of the procedure. The chest tube is favored to be removed at the end of expiration while the patient is performing a Valsalva maneuver. At this moment, the difference between the pleural pressure and the outside atmospheric pressure is the lowest. A chest tube may also be removed safely during inspiration. Irrespective of the technique used, rapid removal of the chest tube minimizes the time when the chest tube site provides a potential opening that can permit the intake of intrapleural air (which might occur during a quick inspiration as the patient experiences pain). Following removal, the chest tube entry site should quickly be covered with dry or petroleum gauze to create a seal followed by a sterile dressing. 1,2 Suture closure of the chest tube site is not needed unless a large incision was created for the chest tube insertion. In hospitalized patients, a chest radiograph after chest tube removal provides a new baseline study for comparison with subsequent imaging. Postremoval chest radiographs were once a common practice, but current evidence suggests that clinical observation following removal is suf /uniFB01 cient. 27",
