      "title": "1. Introduction",
      "content": "Pulmonary nodules are a common but di /uniFB03 cult issue for physicians [1]. With the results of the National Lung Cancer Screening Trial demonstrating a reduction in lung cancer mortality with screening of patients with low dose CT, it is expected that the number of nodules detected requiring follow up is likely to increase [2]. In studies of incidentally detected nodules, the prevalence of malignancy ranges from 2 to 82% [3], the dilemma for clinicians is deciding on the management and further diagnostic modalities to pursue to optimize yield, minimize complications and reduce benign surgical resections rates. This study aims to explore the e /uniFB03 cacy of a staged procedure for the diagnosis of pulmonary nodules using multiple approaches to perform an electromagnetic (EMN) guided lung biopsy.\nThe American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines for the management of pulmonary nodules state that if a nodule does not have stable or benign features, management decisions are based on surgical risk and the clinical probability that the nodule is malignant [1, 4]. For patients with nodules of intermediate probability for malignancy (5 -65%), the various recommended procedures for obtaining tissue diagnosis include transthoracic needle biopsy (TTNA), surgery, and /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopy (FB). The diagnostic yield with FB varies with nodule size and location. Based on a review of 10 studies using FB for diagnosing peripheral pulmonary nodules (PPN), the sensitivity is only 34% for nodules < 2 cm and has been found to be as low as 14% [5, 6]. The sensitivity increases to 63% when nodules are > 2 cm in size, but decreases as the distance from the hilum increases.\nProcedural guidance technologies such as EMN and radial endobronchial ultrasound (R-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)) have been integrated into bronchoscopic guidelines. Recently, a large retrospective study investigating the yield of bronchoscopy, reported a yield of only 38.5% when an older generation of EMN was used and 47.1% when EMN was combined with R-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) [7]. A meta-analysis found a pooled diagnostic yield of 70% for guided bronchoscopy using EMN, EMN bronchoscopy (ENB) or R-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) [8]. These studies were performed prior to the introduction of the combined ENB and EMN guided percutaneous transthoracic needle aspiration (EMN-TTNA) system (Veran Inc., St. Louis MO). The novel system allows EMN guidance for a transthoracic approach for the sampling of pulmonary nodules that can be performed during the same procedure as an ENB in a staged procedure.\nIn a prospective pilot study evaluating the safety, feasibility, and diagnostic yield of this staged approach in patients who underwent endobronchial ultrasound (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)), followed by ENB, and EMN-TTNA, the diagnostic yield of EMN-TTNA alone was found to be 83%, and when combined with ENB was 87% [9]. The diagnostic yield increased to 92% when combined with Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS). The results demonstrated an acceptable safety and feasibility pro /uniFB01 le, however, due to its small sample size and single center design, a larger, multi-center study is warranted.\nWe undertake this prospective, single-arm study to assess the bene /uniFB01 ts of a staged procedure on diagnostic yield, the ability to decrease the need for independent procedures performed, and the time to diagnosis.",

      "content": "In this study, we aim to target these patients with indeterminate or high risk nodules in whom a tissue diagnosis via /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopy and/or TTNA would alter management. The ACCP characterizes\npulmonary nodules based o /uniFB00 their pre-test probability of malignancy. Those at high risk (estimated probability of malignancy > 65%) are generally older, have larger nodules, a smoking history, irregular margins and upper lobe predominance. Intermediate risk nodules (estimate probability of malignancy of 5 -65%) have a mixture of high and low probability features. Low risk nodules (< 5%) are typically seen in younger patients who have smaller nodules with minimal smoking history and benign features appearance on CT. Although many clinicians estimate the probability of malignancy intuitively, to aid in determining the pre-test probability of malignancy, multiple risk calculators have been developed [10 -12]. One of the most widely used and validated calculator is the Mayo Clinic model which takes into account six independent demographic and imaging predictors of mortality [13]. For inclusion and patient selection in this study, we will utilize the Mayo Clinic model to aid in the estimation of malignancy.\nTo optimally mimic the real-world application and performance of EMN, nodule size and location need be accounted for in a multicenter trial. Prior data supports smaller nodules and those further from the hilum are signi /uniFB01 cantly more di /uniFB03 cult to access [5, 6]. Thus it is reasonable to expect EMN to o /uniFB00 er the greatest bene /uniFB01 t to those nodules with smaller size which are most di /uniFB03 cult to access. For these reasons, we will limit inclusion in this study to nodules < 3 cm with a balance of central and peripheral location.\nIn an e /uniFB00 ort to expand external validity, this trial will include eight centers throughout the United States with a balance of practices in academic and community settings. The coordinating center will be Johns Hopkins Hospital (Baltimore, MD), with participating sites including Duke University (Durham, NC), University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill, NC), University of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh, PA), Washington University in St. Louis (St. Louis, MO), Swedish Medical Center (Seattle, WA), Grady Memorial Hospital (Atlanta, GA), and Banner Health (Phoenix, AZ).\nPatient screening and informed consent will follow each participating institution's standard of care. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in Table 1. Subjects will be approached at their standard of care clinic appointment or prior to their scheduled bronchoscopy and will explain the study to quali /uniFB01 ed subjects prior to obtaining consent. Each patient's participation in this study is expected to be approximately 1 year from the index procedure to study exit.",

Based on our pilot data [9] and review of the literature we hypothesize a conservative diagnostic yield of 70% in the staged approach. After review of current published diagnostic yields of 1 -3 cm nodules [14, 18 -26], the estimated diagnostic yield of historical controls is 59% (historical data on 665 patients out of which 385 had a successful biopsy). To achieve 80% power to detect a di /uniFB00 erence between the group proportions of 11% (70% versus 59%), a sample size of 149 will be needed in this single-arm trial.

      "content": "The management of intermediate risk pulmonary nodules continues to present a clinical dilemma. With no single approach proven superior to another, clinicians and their patients are left to decide between surveillance and the multiple forms of biopsy including: surgical biopsy, /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopy and TTNA. Ideally, to guide further management, a minimally invasive approach to obtaining a tissue diagnosis would be preferred. However, at this time, no perfect approach exists. Simple surveillance often leaves patients with anxiety with regards to the possibility of malignancy and carries a risk (albeit small) of disease progression. The most aggressive and decisive approach is surgical biopsy; however, this comes with added risk and in the case of potentially benign disease, the patient may have been subjected to harm that may have been avoidable. At this time, there are two main options for obtaining a minimally invasive biopsy, via /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopy or percutaneous (transthoracic) needle biopsy. Both of these approaches have limitations and when considering the risk and bene /uniFB01 t pro /uniFB01 les of these procedures neither has been de /uniFB01 nitively proven superior to another. This study aims to evaluate the e /uniFB03 cacy of a staged, combined approach using both /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopy and transthoracic needle biopsy using EMN, hypothesizing that there will be an increase in diagnostic yield with a signi /uniFB01 cant decrease in complications, in comparison to historic controls. This staged approach has potential to position itself as the preferred method of minimally invasive biopsy.",

Comparisons could be made to CT guided TTNA; however, this comparison would be biased as classically central lesions are not accessible to CT guided TTNA, which would limit a direct comparison to pulmonary nodules across all lung zones. A direct comparison of a combined EMN approach to CT guided TTNA would also potentially subject patients to added procedures if either procedure were nondiagnostic. Another potential limitation is a lack of a mortality analysis. We feel it would be inappropriate to comment on mortality given there will be wide variation of the underlying diagnosis' that would certainly bias any mortality assessment.",
