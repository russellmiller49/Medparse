To date, the benefits have been modest but have been hypothesized to be much larger in patients without interlobar collateral ventilation than in those with collateral ventilation.\nMETHODS We randomly assigned patients with severe emphysema and a confirmed absence of collateral ventilation to bronchoscopic endobronchial-valve treatment (EBV group) or to continued standard medical care (control group). Primary outcomes were changes from baseline to 6 months in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and 6-minute walk distance.\nRESULTS Eighty-four patients were recruited, of whom 16 were excluded because they had collateral ventilation (13 patients) or because lobar segments were inaccessible to the endobronchial valves (3 patients). The remaining 68 patients (mean [±SD] age, 59±9 years; 46 were women) were randomly assigned to the EBV group (34 patients) or the control group (34). At baseline, the FEV1 and FVC were 29±7% and 77±18% of the predicted values, respectively, and the 6-minute walk distance was 374±86 m. Intention-to-treat analyses showed significantly greater improvements in the EBV group than in the control group from baseline to 6 months: the increase in FEV1 was greater in the EBV group than in the control group by 140 ml (95% confidence interval [CI], 55 to 225), the increase in FVC was greater by 347 ml (95% CI, 107 to 588), and the increase in the 6-minute walk distance was greater by 74 m (95% CI, 47 to 100) (P<0.01 for all comparisons). By 6 months, 23 serious adverse events had been reported in the EBV group, as compared with 5 in the control group (P<0.001). One patient in the EBV group died.

      "content": "B ronchoscopic  lung-volume  reduction with the use of one-way endobronchial  valves  has  emerged  as  a  potential treatment for patients with severe emphysema. This treatment was previously investigated in the randomized, controlled Endobronchial Valve for Emphysema  Palliation  Trial  (VENT), 1   which showed significant but moderate improvements in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ): an increase from baseline of 4.3% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4 to 7.2). Post hoc analyses of the VENT data suggested that endobronchialvalve  treatment might be more effective in patients who had a complete fissure (as compared with  an  incomplete  fissure)  between  the  lobe that was targeted for treatment and the adjacent lobe  on  high-resolution  computed  tomography (HRCT) and when endobronchial-valve treatment resulted in complete occlusion of the target lobe. 1\nA complete fissure on HRCT is a surrogate finding for the absence of interlobar collateral ventilation;  if  there  is  collateral  ventilation,  an occluded lobe can be reinflated through its collaterals. 2 It  is  difficult  to  assess  the  completeness of the fissure on HRCT in order to predict the  absence  of  collateral  ventilation,  with  considerable  interobserver  variation. 3   Temporary bronchoscopic lobar occlusion, achieved by inflation of a balloon catheter in the lobar bronchus, is another way to assess collateral ventilation. When combined with HRCT, this method has been  shown  to  increase  the  predictability  of lung-volume reduction after endobronchial-valve treatment. 4   We conducted a randomized, controlled  study,  called  STELVIO,  to  examine  the effectiveness  of  endobronchial-valve  treatment in patients with severe emphysema in whom the absence of collateral ventilation had been proved.",

A continuous expiratory flow through the catheter indicates collateral ventilation, and a flow gradually declining to zero indicates no collateral ventilation. Zephyr endobronchial valves (Pulmonx) were placed in all segments or subsegments of the target lobe as previously described, with the patient under either general anesthesia or conscious sedation. 1,4  Valve placement was performed during the initial bronchoscopic procedure for patients assigned to the EBV group and at 6 months for patients assigned to the control group.",

Clinical  response  was  defined  on  the basis of established minimal clinically important differences from baseline (FEV 1 , a 10% increase 10 ; 6-minute walk distance, a 26-m increase 11 ; SGRQ score, a 4-point reduction 8 ; CCQ score, a 0.4-point reduction 9 ;  total  volume  of  the  treated  lobe,  a 350-ml reduction 2 ; and residual volume, a 430-ml reduction 12 ). Safety data were collected during the study. At baseline and at 1 month and 6 months of  follow-up,  the  6-minute  walk  test  was  performed according to American Thoracic Society\nrecommendations, 13  and the SGRQ, 7 CCQ, 9  and mMRC 6  scores were obtained.

HRCT was performed at baseline and at 6  months  after  endobronchial-valve  treatment. Target-lobe selection and fissure integrity were assessed  visually  on  the  baseline  inspiratory HRCT scan (SOMATOM Sensation 64 eco, Siemens Healthcare; slice thickness, 1.0 mm) with the use of the AquariusNET viewer V4.4.7.85 (TeraRecon). After study completion, computerized quantifications were performed on the HRCT data set (Thirona  Lung  Quantification,  version  15.01 [Thirona]). 16,17  We calculated lobar volumes and the percentage of voxels of less than -950 Hounsfield units (an indicator of the fraction of emphysematous lung). We classified the distribution of  emphysema  in  the  treated  lung  as  homogeneous if the destruction scores for the upper and lower lobes differed by less than 15% and as heterogeneous if the scores differed by 15% or more.",

      "content": "The initial sample size was based on the available post hoc analyses of the active treatment groups in the VENT, international VENT, and Chartis trial 1,2,4 and on our preliminary findings. With  an  alpha  level  at  5%  and  a  beta  level  at 20%, we calculated that we would need to randomly assign 28 patients to the study groups (14 per group), all of whom could be fully evaluated with respect to the change in the percentage of the predicted FEV 1 . A subsequent interim analysis  for  safety,  withdrawal  from  the  study, and assessment of the accuracy of FEV 1 assumptions showed a higher pneumothorax rate and a lower  mean  difference  from  baseline  for  the percentage of the predicted FEV 1 than we had assumed. To account for these findings, 68 patients  were  deemed  necessary  for  randomization. A two-sample t-test and Fisher's exact test were performed to test for differences between groups  at  baseline.  Intention-to-treat  analyses were  performed  on  the  primary  end  points;  if there  were  no  available  data  after  study  exit, then multiple imputation was used for missing\ndata. Primary, secondary, and other efficacy outcomes were also evaluated in analyses restricted to patients who completed the study. Paired t-tests were used, or in the absence of a normal distribution, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used,\nto compare the groups with respect to changes from baseline to 6 months in study outcomes. Bonferroni correction was performed for multiple  comparisons  for  the  three  primary  end points. P values of less than 0.0167, for primary\noutcomes,  and  less  than  0.05,  for  secondary outcomes, were considered to indicate statistical significance. For each outcome, response rates were calculated by counting the number of patients who had a change from baseline that met the criterion for a minimal clinically important difference. Fisher's exact test was performed for calculations of between-group differences in outcomes and adverse events. SPSS Statistics, version  22  (IBM),  was  used  for  all  analyses.

Reasons  for  repeat bronchoscopy were permanent removal of endobronchial valves  because  of  recurrent  pneumothorax (in 2 patients), torsion of the left-lowerlobe bronchus after left-upper-lobe treatment (in 2), pneumonia distal to the valves (in 1), and markedly increased dyspnea and sputum production without a treatment benefit, as perceived by the patient (in 2); and temporary removal of endobronchial valves to promote healing of a pneumothorax, with valve replacement after 2 months (in  1).  Other  reasons  for  repeat  bronchoscopy were valve replacement due to migration (in 2), valve  dislocation  because  of  granulation-tissue formation (in 1), and persistent cough, with valve replacement in the other lobe (in 1).

      "title": "Discussion",
      "content": "We found that endobronchial-valve treatment in patients with emphysema and a proven absence of  interlobar  collateral  ventilation  provided  a\nmeasurable clinical benefit,  with  significantly improved  lung  function,  exercise  capacity,  and quality of life, as compared with usual care. The reduction in lung volume with subsequent positive outcomes was accompanied by adverse effects,  mainly  pneumothorax,  which  was  managed  by means  of  regular  care (including chest-tube drainage) but sometimes required repeated bronchoscopy. The endobronchial valves were  retained  throughout  the  6-month  study period in 79% of the initially treated patients.\nThis prospective, randomized, controlled trial confirmed the results of open-label and post hoc studies  assessing  responses  to  endobronchialvalve  treatment. 1,2,4,18 In  the  VENT, 1 the  overall benefits  were  moderate,  but  post  hoc  analysis showed a significantly  greater  improvement  in FEV 1 in patients with a complete fissure, which indicates  an  absence  of  collateral  ventilation, than in those with an incomplete fissure. A previous  multicenter  study  validating  the  Chartis system,  which  measures  collateral  ventilation, showed that treatment success was not associated with the method of fissure assessment (i.e., fissure assessment by means of highly dedicated HRCT vs. assessment by means of the Chartis system). 4 However, the current results show that when collateral ventilation is assessed, the overall outcome of treatment is positive. In our study, 84 patients were preselected on the basis of hav-\ning  complete  or  nearly  complete  fissures  on HRCT scans, with an additional 13 of those patients (15%) excluded on the basis of assessment by means of the Chartis system. We think it is reasonable to speculate that these patients with collateral ventilation would not have had a benefit from endobronchial-valve treatment.\nAmong the patients who completed the study, there was a significant benefit of the treatment on  FEV 1 ,  residual  volume,  6-minute  walk  distance, and scores on the CCQ and SGRQ, with effect sizes all well above the established minimal  clinically  important  differences  for  these variables (Fig. 1). The improvements with endobronchial-valve treatment tended to be larger in patients  with  emphysema  that  was  heterogeneous than in those with emphysema that was homogeneous,  although  we  observed  improvements  in  both  subgroups,  a  finding  that  was also suggested by post hoc analysis of the data from the international VENT. 2  Although comparisons among studies is difficult, it is interesting to note that the improvements we found were of greater magnitude than those noted with pharmacologic treatment in comparable patients and were  similar  to  improvements  with  surgical lung-volume reduction, but with significantly less morbidity. 19,20\nEven though the trial was randomized and controlled,  the  large  improvements  in  SGRQ\nShown are primary outcomes in the intention-to-treat population (Panel A) and secondary outcomes among patients who completed the study (Panel B), according to the assigned study group (endobronchial-valve [EBV] group or control group). Scores on the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) range from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating worse quality of life. Scores on the Clinical Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Questionnaire (CCQ) range from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating worse functioning. Horizontal lines represent the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the following outcomes: forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), 10  an increase of 100 ml; 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), 11  an increase of 26 m; SGRQ score, 8  a reduction of 4 points, CCQ score, 9  a reduction of 0.4 points; and residual volume (RV), 12  a reduction of 430 ml. T bars indicate 95% confidence intervals, and FVC denotes forced vital capacity.\nscores could have been influenced by the openlabel design. A previous trial of bronchoscopic intervention, in which a sham control was used, showed that placebo effects were limited in patients with severe Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 21  Two other sources of potential bias should be considered: both patients\nand  bronchoscopists  were  aware  of  the  treatment assignment at the time of bronchoscopy, and the revealed treatment assignments for the patients with collateral ventilation or unsuitable airways for endobronchial-valve placement were put back in the randomization sequence in newly\nsealed envelopes. However, baseline characteristics were similar in the two study groups, except for sex distribution. In addition, the results for the  patients  in  the  control  group  who  crossed over to endobronchial-valve treatment at 6 months were similar to those for the original EBV group.\nPneumothorax, which was the most frequent adverse  event,  is  thought  to  be  due  to  a  rapid shift in lung volumes caused by the rupture of blebs or bullae, the rupture of parenchyma due to  pleural  adhesions,  or  the  response  to  barotrauma. 22 The  observed  frequency  of  pneumothorax (18%) in our study was higher than the frequencies  reported  in  earlier  trials  (VENT  in 2010, 4% 1 ;  Chartis  trial  in  2013,  8% 4 )  but  was similar to the frequency in an analysis of German data  from  2014  (23% 23 ).  This  increase  in the frequency of pneumothorax is probably the result of more successful execution of endobronchial-valve treatment (resulting in a higher percentage of patients having a significant reduction in lobar volume) and patient selection (i.e., patients without  collateral  flow).  All  cases  of  pneumothorax in the EBV group occurred within 1 day after  endobronchial-valve treatment, when the patients were still hospitalized. Because a pneumothorax is a potentially life-threatening complication in patients with severe emphysema, we found  that  close  monitoring  of  patients  after endobronchial-valve treatment, including monitoring after discharge, was crucial. All cases of pneumothorax in our study were managed according to published guidelines. 22,24\nRepeat bronchoscopy is sometimes necessary to replace or temporarily or permanently remove endobronchial valves. Reasons to do so include loss of initial lung-volume reduction due to formation of granulation tissue or valve migration. Previous studies postulated that endobronchial-\nvalve treatment is fully reversible and does not preclude future therapeutic options. 1,2,4 Our study provides  confirmation  of  this  view,  since  all patients in whom endobronchial valves were removed recovered without further side effects.\nIn conclusion, we found that in patients with severe emphysema who were preselected on the basis of a proven absence of interlobar collateral ventilation,  endobronchial-valve  treatment  improved pulmonary function, exercise capacity, and quality of life, even when we considered patients in  whom valve removal was required. Adverse events,  including  potentially  life-threatening events, occurred and required careful follow-up.\nSupported by a grant (171101008, to the University Medical Center Groningen) from the Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development (ZonMw) and by innovation funding from the University Medical Center Groningen.\nMs. Klooster reports receiving lecture fees from Pulmonx and devices for treatments, travel support, and grant support from PneumRx/BTG and Pulmonx; Dr. Kerstjens receiving consulting fees  from  Novartis,  Pfizer,  Boehringer  Ingelheim,  Almirall, GlaxoSmithKline, Takeda, Chiesi, ProtAffin, and Nycomed and grant support from Novartis, all paid to his institution; Dr. van Rikxoort being a cofounder of, an employee of, and a stockholder in Thirona; and Dr. Slebos receiving consulting fees from PneumRx/BTG, lecture fees from PneumRx/BTG, Boston Scientific, Holaira, Olympus Europe, and Pulmonx, devices for treatments from PneumRx/BTG, Holaira, and Pulmonx, travel support from PneumRx/BTG, Boston Scientific, Holaira, Olympus Europe, and Pulmonx, and grant support from PneumRx/BTG, Boston Scientific, Aeris Therapeutics, Holaira, and Pulmonx.
