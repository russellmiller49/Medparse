In the mid to late 1980s, there was a proliferation of 3D printing technology.

In 1989, Scott Crump invented fusion deposition modeling and went on to cofound Stratasys. Today, these two companies, 3D Systems and Stratasys, are the leaders in the 3D printing industry. 2\nAdditive manufacturing via 3D printing has several variations (Fig 1). The most commonly available 3D printing technologies are stereolithography, SLS, fused deposition modeling, and multijet modeling. First, stereolithography (3D Systems; Formlabs) uses a laser to generate an ultraviolet beam at the surface of a pool of photosensitive resin, which leads to local polymerization of the liquid resin. The reaction platform is raised or dropped as each layer is created. This method offers high geometric accuracy but is limited by the resin material available for use (Fig 1A, Video 1). 3 Second, SLS (3D Systems) uses a high-power laser (carbon dioxide) to fuse thermoplastic powder made from plastic, metal, or ceramic. After laser fusing a cross-section, the powder bed drops down one layer thickness, and a new layer of thermoplastic powder is applied. This method allows a variety of materials to be used and affords high accuracy and resolution but at a higher cost (Fig 1B). Third, fused deposition modeling (Stratasys) uses various /uniFB01 laments (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, polylactic acid [PLA], polycarbonate,\npolyamides, polystyrene) that are forced through a heated extrusion nozzle, which melts the /uniFB01 laments on a platform bed. The printer nozzle moves in an x-y-z plane and deposits layer after layer of material that hardens after extrusion. This method provides high geometric accuracy and models that can be sterilized for use in an operative setting (Fig 1C, Video 2). Fourth, multijet modeling (Z Corporation) uses layers of /uniFB01 ne powder (plaster or resin) that is bonded by water-based adhesive. This method allows full-color prototyping but at the sacri /uniFB01 ce of geometric accuracy and mechanical strength (Fig 1D). 2",

      "content": "3D printing materials vary depending on the 3D printer used. 3D printable materials that are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for other medical applications include, but are not limited to, polycaprolactone (PCL), PLA, and poly lacticco -glycolic acid (PLGA). These medical polymers can be used alone or blended to achieve desired properties. PCL has a long history of medical applications attributed to its low melting temperature of approximately 60 /C14 C, low glass transition temperature of /C0 60 /C14 C, and high thermal stability. PCL has been used in both fusion deposition modeling and SLS printers for manufacturing of biological scaffolds for tissue engineering. 4,5 Initially synthesized in the 1920s, PLA is biodegradable thermoplastic aliphatic polyester derived from renewable resources such as corn, sugarcane, roots, or starch. This versatile bioplastic degrades into lactic acid and has been used for implantable screws, mesh, rods, and scaffolds for bone regeneration. 6 PLGA is a copolymer of PLA and polyglycolic acid that is biocompatible and biodegradable and exhibits broad erosion times with modi /uniFB01 able mechanical properties. Depending on the blending ratio of PLA and polyglycolic acid, the resulting PLGA copolymer has very different mechanical properties and degradation pro /uniFB01 les. PLGA has been used for extended drug delivery because it degrades via hydrolysis into lactic and glycolic acid. 7,8 A recent review examined in detail the advances in 3D printing biomaterials. 9",

Investigators were able to use\nCT images to guide the creation of physical models of vascular structures in the brain, heart, and lung. These advances have already proved to be very valuable in clinical care, trainee education, and device development. 3,13 Perhaps the most exciting part of the technology is the potential use of extracellular matrix to 3D bioprint, which may lead to the development of organ printing in the future. 14-16",

      "content": "The anatomy of the tracheobronchial tree is uniquely suited for 3D printing technology. 17 The adult trachea has an internal diameter of approximately 16 to 20 mm and spans approximately 10 to 13 cm. It is covered with 16 to 20 C-shaped pieces of cartilage anterolaterally, and the posterior trachea is membranous. The right mainstem bronchus is approximately 1.5 cm long with an internal diameter of 10 to 12 mm. The left mainstem bronchus is approximately 4 to 4.5 cm long with an internal diameter of 8 to 12 mm (DICOM dataset /uniFB01 le available online as supplementary material). 18 The current molded silicone stents (DUMON; Novatech) have the appropriate ranges of diameter (9-18 mm), thickness (1-1.5 mm), and length (20-110 mm). These stents are manufactured with a conventional mold injection technique and come in prede /uniFB01 ned sizes. If custom modi /uniFB01 cations were needed, a custom stent could be generated in approximately 3 weeks, a substantial wait time for the patient. 19\nSeveral publications have addressed 3D printing in pulmonology. First, in the recent report by Morrison et al, 20 the authors generated personalized airway splints for three pediatric patients with tracheobronchomalacia. The authors used MATLAB (MathWorks) and Mimics (i.Materialise) to create the 3D mesh models of the airway splint and airway, respectively. Subsequently, the airway splint mesh was 3D printed via the FORMIGA P 100 system (EOS e-Manufacturing Solutions) using a blend of 96% PCL (Capa 6501; Polysciences) and 4% hydroxyapatite (Plasma Biotal). After manufacturing, the splints were treated with air blasting, then sonication in 70% ethanol for 30 minutes, and then ethylene oxide sterilization at 49 /C14 C. 20 These splints were placed under the medical device emergency use exemption from the FDA. Second, there were several case reports in which investigators used 3D printed models in thoracic surgery planning or stent placement. 17,21 These articles, when taken together, suggest that\nproducing personalized airway prostheses via additive manufacturing is feasible.",

      "title": "Barriers in 3D Medical Printing",
      "content": "There are several barriers to broad adoption of 3D design and printing in pulmonary medicine. First, there is material limitation. Despite the rapidly increasing number of 3D printable materials, there is a limited amount of materials that are /uniFB02 exible, biocompatible, and FDA approved for medical applications. Many of these materials are in the experimental stage and not accessible to the public.\nSecond, there is a lack of standardization of material testing and cleansing protocols. According to the Center for Disease Control ' s Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 22 four sterilization techniques are commonly used to sterilize medical equipment: autoclave, ethylene oxide gas, hydrogen peroxide gas plasma, and gamma radiation. The autoclave uses direct contact with steam at high temperature (121 /C14 C or 132 /C14 C) and pressure for a minimal amount of time. Although this approach is nontoxic, most 3D printable materials cannot withstand the high temperature, so low temperature ( < 60 /C14 C) approaches are desirable. Ethylene oxide gas is a microbicidal gas that inhibits cellular metabolism and replication via alkylation of protein, DNA, and RNA. Hydrogen peroxide gas plasma and gamma radiation can also be used to sterilize 3D printed material leaving little to no toxic residue. 22\nThird, there is a lack of clarity about how personalized\n3D printed medical devices will be manufactured or regulated. Traditionally, there have been several FDA pathways to market, with premarket approval, 510(k), and humanitarian use device being the most common. Premarket approval is the review process for the safety and effectiveness of Class III medical devices. 23 The FDA classi /uniFB01 es medical devices into Class I, II, or III. Class III devices are intended to support life and prevent health impairment and have potential risk of causing injury. 24 As such, these devices are subject to clinical trials and the highest standards. The 510(k) is essentially a me-too process through which a medical device is demonstrated to be equivalent to a prior marketed device, so the new medical device is subjected to a less stringent review process. 25 The humanitarian use device is an alternative pathway for devices targeting rare diseases ( < 4,000 patients per year) to obtain market approval without proof of\n]\neffectiveness. 26 To date, most of the 3D printed devices have received FDA approval via the 510(k) process. However, as personalization of devices via 3D printing becomes a reality, the challenge will be to provide standardization of design, manufacturing, and sterilization. 27 A recent review outlines the current regulatory pathways, with special consideration given to 3D printed devices. 28\nFinally, physicians often lack the technical skill set to use 3D design and modeling software. This lack leads to slower adoption of 3D printing in the health-care /uniFB01 eld. Of these barriers, we aim to address the last barrier by introducing the use of the open-source software, 3D Slicer, for digital modeling.",

On the basis of experiences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Surgical Planning Laboratory, David Gering built the initial prototype of 3D Slicer in 1999. Subsequently, Steve Pieper and Ron Kikinis have led the development efforts supported by the National Institutes of Health. 29 This powerful platform has been used and cited in more than 443 publications and more than 36 pulmonary-speci /uniFB01 c articles.",

      "title": "Use of 3D Slicer in Pulmonary Studies",
      "content": "3D Slicer has been used extensively in preclinical to clinical studies in a research capacity. Within the pulmonary space, 3D Slicer was used successfully in the CT-based quanti /uniFB01 cation of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) by using the Airway Inspector extension (www.airwayinspector.org). Airway Inspector offers the ability to extract the lung automatically and performs densitometry analysis for emphysema and gas trapping quanti /uniFB01 cation. It is also capable of evaluating airway wall size to study airway\nremodeling based on chest CT scans. 30-33 The Chest Imaging Platform (www.chestimagingplatform.org) is the evolution of the Airway Inspector extension to facilitate computational approaches based on chest CT imaging. The Chest Imaging Platform offers a collection of tools for the preprocessing of lung images as well as user modules for disease-speci /uniFB01 c quanti /uniFB01 cation tasks. 34 The by-products of these quanti /uniFB01 cation tasks are digital models of various lung structures that could be used for 3D printing operations (Fig 2, Video 3). For example, the lobar and airway anatomy can be extracted and converted into 3D models for printing. In order to achieve a high/uniFB01 delity 3D reconstruction, it would be ideal to use high-resolution CT scans. However, 3D Slicer is capable of using Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine data from low-dose CT scans and is still able to construct acceptable models.\nCOPDGene investigators have successfully used 3D Slicer to examine airway wall thickness in patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and bronchodilator responsiveness. Processing more than 3,600 subjects ' CT scans, the group found that the airway wall thickness is increased in the cohort that has bronchodilator reactivity. 35 Furthermore, 3D Slicer has been used in pulmonary nodule assessment for lung cancer. In a 2013 study on non-small cell lung cancer, Velazquez et al 36 used 3D Slicer to extract volumetric data on non-small cell lung cancer size. This capability to quantify tumor growth accurately in 3D space allows a medical oncologist to engage patients better and to monitor treatment response more accurately. These approaches demonstrate just a few ways in which 3D Slicer is used today.\nAt the time of writing of this article, 3D Slicer is in version 4.54 and has 70 installable extensions. The major appeal of 3D Slicer is manifold. It is freeware with an open modular platform, clean user interface, and ability to run on the main computing platforms (Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux). The major drawback of 3D Slicer is that it is not FDA approved for daily clinical applications but rather is to be used for clinical research.\n3D ¼ three-dimensional; PC ¼ personal computer.",

      "content": "One of the main advantages of 3D Slicer is that it provides an extensible platform for novel automated algorithms. In a recent publication by Nardelli et al, 37\nan airway segmentation algorithm was developed as a 3D Slicer extension and validated with a number of CT scans. Most airway segmentation techniques are based on a region-growing approach in which a base\n]\nvoxel serves as the seed and a threshold cutoff for separating air from tissue. The method of Nardelli et al 37 used region growing from cropped trachea and right and left bronchi with their respective thresholds. This approach allowed them to generate a very accurate tracheobronchial tree (Video 4; e-Appendix 1).",

      "title": "3D Slicer to Generate Physical Airway Models",
      "content": "The process of generating a physical airway model is straightforward. After downloading and installing 3D Slicer, the user will need to install the extension for airway segmentation. 3D Slicer will have to be restarted for the extension to take effect. The user will then need to load the CT scan and select the airway segmentation module. Once in airway segmentation, /uniFB01 ducials (or seeds) must be placed within the trachea and right and left bronchi, which will serve as the start of airway modeling. Once the digital model of the airway has been generated, the user can then save the /uniFB01 le into .STL format, which can then be sent to a 3D printer for printing (Fig 3). Using the 3D Slicer airway segmentation algorithm, one can generate a physical 3D printed airway model. This model can then be used for preprocedural planning. The digital model generated from 3D Slicer can be imported into a variety of types of digital modeling software that allow further manipulation of the digital airway model (Fig 4; e-Appendix 1).",
