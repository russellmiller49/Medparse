In the spontaneous subgroup, PC drainage was associated with a signiﬁcantly shorter drainage duration (mean difference, 1.51 [95% CI, 2.93 to 0.09]) and hospital stay (mean difference: 2.54 [95% CI, 3.16 to 1.92]; P < .001) than the LBCT group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Collectively, results of the meta-analysis suggest PC drainage may be considered as the initial treatment option for patients with primary or secondary spontaneous pneumothorax.

Pneumothorax can be categorized according to its etiology as primary spontaneous pneumothorax, secondary spontaneous pneumothorax, and iatrogenic or traumatic pneumothorax. Although a small spontaneous pneumothorax may resolve without treatment, for patients who are symptomatic (ie, signi /uniFB01 cant dyspnea de /uniFB01 ned as deterioration in usual exercise tolerance 2 ) and exhibit a larger pneumothorax (rim of air > 2 cm), simple aspiration or tube thoracostomy is necessary. 1 However, whether a smallbore pigtail catheter (PC) or a large-bore chest tube (LBCT) should be used as the initial treatment for pneumothorax remains controversial. For example, according to the American College of Chest Physicians\nDelphi consensus statement, 2 an LBCT (16F-28F) should be used for treating larger and unstable primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax; by contrast, the British Thoracic Society no longer recommends the use of the LBCT for primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. 1 In addition, clinical guidelines are unclear regarding the management strategies for pneumothorax subtypes other than primary and secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. Due to the inconsistency and the paucity of evidence, substantial variations exist in the approaches used for the initial management of pneumothorax in clinical practice. 3 We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effectiveness of small-bore PC drainage compared with that of LBCT drainage as the initial treatment for different subtypes of pneumothorax.",

In the case of disagreement, other reviewers (H. Y. C. and Y. H. C.) served as the arbitrators. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the methodologic quality and risk of bias of the included cohort studies, and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool was used for the included RCTs, as recommended in the Cochrane Handbook. 6,7 The appraisal tools are described in detail in e-Figure 1 and e-Table 1. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool comprises seven methodologic domains: (1) random sequence generation; (2) allocation concealment; (3) blinding of participants and personnel; (4) blinding of assessment; (5) incomplete outcome data; (6) selective reporting; and (7) other sources of bias. The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Form comprises eight methodologic domains associated with a risk of bias that are categorized into three groups: (1) representativeness of the exposed cohort; (2) selection of the nonexposed cohort; (3) ascertainment of exposure; (4) demonstration that the outcome of interest was not present at the start of the study; (5) comparability of cohorts on the basis of the design or analysis controlled for confounders; (6) assessment of the outcome; (7) whether the followup was long enough for the outcomes to occur; and (8) and adequacy of follow-up of cohorts (e-Fig 1, e-Table 1).\nTwo reviewers (H.

Furthermore, compared\nwith the LBCT group, the PC group had shorter drainage duration and hospital stay in patients with spontaneous pneumothorax and fewer complications in patients with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax.\nAlthough the LBCT has been the dominant treatment of choice in pneumothorax patients for decades, in recent years, abundant literature has supported a paradigm shift toward the more routine use of PC for managing pneumothorax with varying severity. The advantages of a PC are smaller size, small incision, better patient comfort, and outpatient management. Some studies have suggested that PC drainage is cost-saving and may be a reasonable treatment approach for the /uniFB01 rst episode of large spontaneous pneumothorax. 18,19 However, the disadvantage of a PC is the lower /uniFB02 ow rate. 20,21 The gas /uniFB02 ow rates through a chest tube are related to various factors, as illustrated in the Fanning equation. 22 Generally, air has minimal viscosity; therefore, a smallbore PC may be suf /uniFB01 cient for most air leaks resulting from pure alveolar-pleural /uniFB01 stula regardless of the classi /uniFB01 cation of pneumothorax. Conversely, the LBCT can be reserved for refractory pneumothorax and in the emergent scenarios. 13\nOverall, the pooled estimate of the RRs for the success rate indicated that PC drainage was as effective as LBCT drainage for the management of pneumothorax irrespective of the subtypes. In previous studies, the success rate of spontaneous pneumothorax has ranged from 65% to 88% for the PC group and 72% to 80% for the LBCT group. 17,19,23 With regard to the recurrence rate, we could only include four studies of spontaneous",

      "content": "pneumothorax, 3,12,14,17 and the pooled results showed no statistically signi /uniFB01 cant differences between the PC and LBCT groups. A previous study suggested that secondary spontaneous pneumothorax associated with obstructive lung conditions and malignancy (but not infectious diseases) may bene /uniFB01 t from PC treatment. 24 However, data on the recurrence rate in patients with traumatic or iatrogenic pneumothorax were lacking.\nWe found that the PC group had signi /uniFB01 cantly lower complication rates than the LBCT group in both spontaneous (six studies) 3,9,12,14,16,17 and secondary (two studies) 9,17 subtypes. The most frequent complications of both groups were tube displacement and sepsis, followed by surgical emphysema. 9,17,25 Hussein et al 9 also found that these complications were more common in the failed cases than in the successful cases, with statistically signi /uniFB01 cant differences. Moreover, the frequency of drainage complications was higher in the failed cases of the LBCT group than in the failed cases of the PC group. This result suggests that PC drainage may be considered as an initial treatment of choice for patients with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax given that the complication rate was lower even in the failed cases.\nThe present study reported highly signi /uniFB01 cant reductions in drainage duration and length of hospital stay among patients with spontaneous pneumothorax who used a PC compared with those who used an LBCT. Speci /uniFB01 cally, two studies reported a signi /uniFB01 cantly shorter drainage duration for PC drainage, with low heterogeneity. 9,17 However, the number of included studies was small. Further investigation of drainage duration and hospital stay is warranted.\nThe LBCT has long been the gold standard for most cases of thoracic trauma. In our meta-analysis, we included two articles pertaining to traumatic pneumothorax, which showed no signi /uniFB01 cant differences in success rates, complication rates, or drainage duration between the PC and LBCT groups. 10,11 However, the two studies were conducted at the same institution. In addition, a few studies have suggested that the PC is preferable in selected patients with uncomplicated pneumothorax without hemothorax or nonemergency tube insertion. 26 In a recent study, Tanizaki et al 27 reported that for patients with chest trauma, drainage ef /uniFB01 cacy, complication rates, and need for additional invasive procedures did not differ between treatment with 20F to 22F small tubes (even in emergent situations) and LBCT treatment (28F). Nonetheless,\nbecause traumatic pneumothorax often occurs with other organ injuries, and its severity often varies across cases, additional studies are needed to delineate the indications and applications of the PC, taking into account associated complications such as hemopneumothorax, respiratory failure, tracheobronchial injury, tension pneumothorax, and /uniFB02 ail chest.\nIatrogenic pneumothorax has recently become the most encountered type of pneumothorax compared with traumatic or spontaneous pneumothorax. 28 In most studies, the incidence of pneumothorax secondary to central vein catheter varies between 0.5% and 5%, 29 which ranks highest among the causes of iatrogenic pneumothorax. 30 Only one article included in our study focused on pneumothorax complicated by central vein catheter insertion, 13 and there was no difference in the success rate between the PC and LBCT groups (Relative risk (RR), 0.97 [95% CI, 0.72 -1.31]) (Fig 2). No complications due to PC insertion were observed in this article. The mean PC drainage duration was 1.6 days for PC and 9.8 days for LBCT drainage. Galbois et al 31 included a total of 561 patients (130 patients with iatrogenic pneumothorax and others with spontaneous pneumothorax) who were treated with a PC (8F), and they reported that the rate of video-assisted thoracoscopy due to drainage failure was less frequent for iatrogenic pneumothorax than for primary spontaneous pneumothorax ( P < .001). Although the authors did not compare the effectiveness of PC drainage with that of LBCT drainage, their results suggest that the PC may be used to effectively manage iatrogenic pneumothorax as well.\nThe present meta-analysis has some limitations. First, the /uniFB01 ve main outcomes were not completely assessed in all articles. Second, only two RCTs were included in our meta-analysis. Retrospective cohort studies have the natural limitation of selection bias and unmeasured confounders; therefore, more RCTs with a suf /uniFB01 cient sample size should be conducted to con /uniFB01 rm our results. In the meta-analysis, we analyzed the characteristics of patients obtained from individual studies. Thus, we could not conduct strati /uniFB01 ed analyses based on patientlevel factors such as age, sex, smoking status, and the initial severity of pneumothorax. Furthermore, our included studies did not comprise patients with pneumothorax requiring mechanical ventilation, which is a group of patients in which further investigation and veri /uniFB01 cation are required. Lastly, there were no studies comparing PC vs LBCT in patients with pneumothorax who were mechanically ventilated. Because patients with\n[ 153#5\nCHEST\nMAY 2018\n]\nmechanical ventilation have high risks of mortality 32 (ranging from 46% to 77% 33,34 ), tube thoracostomy is routinely used as clinical management. Although a few studies found that the PC sized 7F to 10F can be an effective therapeutic option, 35 with a success rate of 68.6% and no major complications, 36 studies comparing the effectiveness of PC vs LBCT are lacking. Furthermore, the ef /uniFB01 cacy of PC drainage vs LBCT for barotraumatic pneumothorax remains unclear.",

      "content": "Toour knowledge, this study is the /uniFB01 rst meta-analysis and systematic review comparing PC and LBCT drainage as the initial management strategy for the /uniFB01 rst episode of pneumothorax. We found that for spontaneous pneumothorax, the drainage duration and hospital stay\nare shorter in the PC group. Furthermore, for secondary spontaneous pneumothorax, the complication rate is signi /uniFB01 cantly lower in the PC group. Collectively, results of the meta-analysis suggest that the PC drainage may be considered as the initial treatment option for patients with primary or secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. Given the paucity of data on utility of PC vs LBCT in patents of traumatic and iatrogenic pneumothorax, as well as the lack of data in this meta-analysis for patients who are being mechanically ventilated, the /uniFB01 ndings should be interpreted cautiously. Additional studies, ideally multicenter RCTs, are needed to examine the comparative utility of small-bore vs LBCT among different subgroups of patients with pneumothorax, which may ultimately improve clinical care and management for these patients.",
