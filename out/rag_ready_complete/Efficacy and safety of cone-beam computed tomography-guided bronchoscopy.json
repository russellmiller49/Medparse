      "title": "Introduction",
      "content": "The detection rate of pulmonary lesions has risen significantly due to the ubiquitous utilization of low-dose computed tomography (CT) for lung cancer screening in recent years. The overall five-year survival rate for lung cancer is approximately 20% after being diagnosed (1,2). Early detection and diagnosis of malignant pulmonary lesions is  crucial  (3).  The  sensitivity  of  conventional transbronchial biopsy or transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) is 14-63% in diagnosing malignant lesions (4). CT-guided transthoracic biopsy or needle aspiration\npossesses high diagnostic yield (DY) (88-93%) but high adverse events rate (pneumothorax 16.8-25.9%) (5). Guided bronchoscopy has been increasingly used for the diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs) over the past decade. A meta-analysis showed that the DY for virtual bronchoscopy (VB) and electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) was 69.4% and 70.3%, respectively (6). Recently, cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) have been utilized in the navigation of PPLs. CBCT provides comprehensive threedimensional intra-procedural imaging and can be employed to affirm tool-in-lesion before biopsy, potentially influencing all stages of diagnostic bronchoscopy: navigation, verification and tissue obtaining (7).\nThe DY of CBCT-guided bronchoscopy was ranging from 45% to 93% (8-30). Nadig et  al. reported that DY of lesions >20 mm [78.7%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 76.2-81.3%] was higher than that of lesions ≤ 20 mm (58.7%, 95% CI: 55.1-62.3%), and the DY of lesions with bronchus sign (78.6%, 95% CI: 75.2-82.0%) was higher than that of lesions without bronchus sign (51.2%, 95% CI: 45.0-57.4%) in guided bronchoscopy (31). Whether lesions >20 mm and bronchus sign can be used as predictors of successful CBCT-guided bronchoscopy was still not known. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of CBCT-guided bronchoscopy for PPL and tried to identify factors that predict higher DY of CBCT-guided bronchoscopy. We present this article in accordance with the PRISMA-DTA reporting checklist (available at https://jtd.amegroups.com/article/ view/10.21037/jtd-24-1224/rc).",

And subgroup analyses were conducted according to additional use of navigation, use of fixed or mobile CBCT, use of rEBUS, use of ROSE, CT spin before biopsy to affirm tool-in-lesion, strictness of the definition of DY, and study design. The summary of the subgroup analyses is shown in Table 3 .  Subgroup analysis based on additional navigation techniques showed that DY was highest when CBCT was used with RAB (pooled DY 87.5%; 95% CI: 81.5-92.4%), whereas DY was 78.9% (95% CI: 70.8-85.9%) when CBCT was used alone. The pooled DY was 79.0% (95% CI: 73.5-84.0%) when CBCT was used with longer established navigation (ENB and VB). Only one study used CBCT with NEAFNS, the DY was 77.2%.

Six studies compared the DY between upper and non-upper lobe lesions. No significant difference was observed in the odds of diagnosis between upper lode lesions and non-upper lobe lesions (OR =1.39, P=0.13). Five studies compared DY between lesions with and without bronchus sign.

Pooled adverse event rate was 2.3%.\nIn our meta-analysis, when CBCT-guided bronchoscopy was used alone, the pooled DY was 78.9%, which was comparable to the pooled DY of 78.2% reported by Kops et  al. (6). In the study by Kops et  al. ,  only  five  studies evaluated the efficacy of CBCT-guided bronchoscopy when used alone, whereas we included ten studies. Although they evaluated the DY of CBCT multimodality, however, the DY of CBCT used with different navigation was not provided. Our subgroup analysis showed that the pooled DY was higher when CBCT used with RAB (87.5%), whereas the pooled DY of CBCT combined with longer established navigation (VB and ENB) was 79.0%. ENB and VB are guided by preoperative CT images. In the operation, changes in lung volume or atelectasis may result in lower DY. Some platforms of RAB have incorporated a system to address CT to body divergence by incorporating a  target-location-updating function utilizing digital tomography (36). We performed subgroup analysis based on the use of fixed or mobile CBCT, which, to our knowledge, is the first subgroup analysis based on the use of fixed or mobile CBCT. The result showed that the DY of fixed CBCT-guided bronchoscopy was 81.2% (95% CI: 77.8-84.3%), which was higher than that of mobile CBCTguided bronchoscopy (76.7%, 95% CI: 54.1-93.3%). Mobile CBCT provides lower image quality and requires more time for image acquisition compared to fixed CBCT, which may explain this result. However, fixed CBCT is\nQUADAS-2, Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2.\nusually mounted on the floor or ceiling of interventional radiology or hybrid operating rooms, making them inaccessible to most bronchoscopists. Our subgroup analysis based on the use of rEBUS showed that the combined DY was similar regardless of whether rEBUS was used or not. rEBUS is not real-time guidance and is not considered as strict navigation technique in many articles (6,32). The radial probe must be removed from the bronchoscope before biopsy, the forceps may enter a bronchus other than the one initially identified (37). CBCT offers comprehensive threedimensional intra-procedural imaging and can be utilized to confirm tool-in-lesion, potentially having an impact on all\nphases of diagnostic bronchoscopy: navigation, verification, and tissue acquisition (7). Similar DY was observed in prospective (80.3%, 95% CI: 71.3-87.9%) and retrospective (80.6%, 95% CI: 76.5-84.4%) subgroups. In a hypothetical cohort generated by Vachani et  al. ,  DYs could have a variation of 13% to 22% depending on whether strict and liberal definitions were adopted (34). In our subgroup analysis, the DY of liberal group was 78.2% which was similar to the DY of strict group and intermediate group (78.9% and 81.3%). Similar to the study by Kops et al. (6), the DY did not vary greatly between strict, intermediate and liberal definitions. In addition to the difference in follow-\nup duration mentioned by Kops et  al. ,  other confounding factors such as the combination of different navigation systems, characteristics of pulmonary lesions, whether ROSE was used, and operator experience may affect the DY. Recently, the official research statement of American Thoracic Society/American College of Chest Physicians recommended strict definition of DY (38). However, old studies have not taken these definitions into account. More future studies following this statement will be helpful in obtaining more accurate and standardized data.\nDifferent characteristics of lesions can also affect the DY of CBCT-guided bronchoscopy. Consistent to the study by Nadig et al. (31), lesion size >20 mm and presence of bronchus sign were associated with significant increase in the odds of diagnosis (P<0.05). Besides, we conducted meta-analysis based on lesion density (solid vs. non-solid) and location (upper lobe vs. non-upper lobe) of nodules. Our results showed that solid lesions were associated with significant increase in the odds of diagnosis (P<0.05), while the odd of diagnosis was not significantly different between upper lobe and non-upper lobe lesions (P=0.13). Lesion size >20 mm, presence of bronchus sign, and solid lesions could serve as predictors for higher DY in CBCT-guided bronchoscopy. In addition, we evaluated sampling tools, confirmation of tool-in-lesion before biopsy, and ROSE. There was no significant difference in the odds of diagnosis\nbetween forceps and FNA (P=0.99), or between forceps and cryoprobe sampling (P=0.85). Since limited studies provide complete data, further studies are required to confirm or correct the result. When CT spin was performed before biopsy to confirm tool-in-lesion, the pooled DY (83.1%, 95% CI: 78.6-87.2%) was higher than that (73.4%, 95% CI: 62.1-83.3%) when it was not mentioned in the article. Similarly, when ROSE was used, the pooled DY (82.3%, 95% CI: 78.5-85.9%) was higher than that (76.3%, 95% CI: 66.5-84.8%) when ROSE was not mentioned in the article.\nCBCT-guided bronchoscopy was a safe navigation technique, the adverse event rate was only 2.3% in all  studies.  It  may  be  an  excellent  navigation  option for  patients  with  PPLs.  Nevertheless, there are still certain limitations in our meta-analysis which should be considered. First, more clinical studies are needed in the future, especially those using strict definition of DY. Second, most studies had a high or unclear risk of bias in patient selection, index test, and reference standard domains. Third, operator experience may also affect the results. Most studies did not provide sufficient information on procedure time and radiation exposure, which was not analyzed in the meta-analysis. Finally, this meta-analysis only included published studies, and potential publication bias may affect the results.",
