      "content": "The  number  of  patients  suffering  from  chronic  obstructive pulmonary disease (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) worldwide is growing, and it is now the third leading cause of mortality in the world [1].\nThe national and international guidelines recommend [2] that all patients should be treated stage dependently with medical therapy that comprises short- and long-acting bronchodilators including anti-muscarinic drugs and beta agonists, inhaled corticosteroids, pulmonary rehabilitation, and smoking cessation. Selected cases may require prophylactic antibiotics, phosphodiesterase inhibi-\ntors,  oral  corticosteroids,  domiciliary  and  ambulatory oxygen support, and, in the context of respiratory failure, non-invasive nasal ventilation.\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is progressive and characterized by symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, and limited exercise capacity, with some patients developing emphysematous parenchymal destruction [3]. Emphysema is a progressive, irreversible, and debilitating disease resulting from inflammation caused by the prolonged exposure to noxious inhaled agents. The most commonly accepted cause of emphysema is cigarette smoking, but genetic, occupational, and other environmental causes also account for up to 10% of the cases [2]. The alveolar destruction leads to impairment in gas exchange and in air trapping with an increase in residual volume (RV) and hyperinflation. Hyperinflation leads to a mechanical disadvantage of the respiratory  muscles  and  decreased  compliance  of  the chest wall [4], ending in an increase of the work of breathing.\nFor emphysema, only a few treatment options exist. Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) seems to be such an option [5], but due to perceived risks and costs it is not commonly offered [6].\nEndoscopic lung volume reduction (ELVR) is a minimally invasive procedure that has been demonstrated to improve outcomes in patients with severe hyperinflation.\nIn 2016, the first expert panel report [7] published a suggested  treatment  algorithm.  The  update  was  published  in  2017  [8].  Since  then,  additional  randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been published that alter the treatment decisions previously outlined in the original 2016 Expert Panel Report. Based on this increasing level of evidence, the use of ELVR techniques has been adopted and incorporated into the 2017 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) GOLD [2], updated in the GOLD Report 2019 [9], and the use of one-way endobronchial valves (EBVs) has been recommended by the UK/NICE as a standard-of-care therapy [10].  EBVs  have  recently  obtained  US/FDA  approval. More recently, a meta-analysis has demonstrated the relationship  between  lung  volume  reduction  and  clinical benefit [11].",

      "title": "Patient Selection",
      "content": "The recommendation for the selection of patients for further evaluation remains unchanged [8]. Potential patients who are candidates for intervention are those who remain  highly  symptomatic  despite  receiving  optimal medical treatment; i.e., maximal pharmacological ther-\napy with bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids in selected candidates, and maintenance with systemic therapies in selected patients. Patients should also have completed pulmonary rehabilitation and/or are participating in a structured physical therapy program; nutrition support  should  be  instituted  (cachexia/obesity),  and patients  should  have  been  counseled  about  smoking cessation.  The  key  evaluations  include  a  full  medical assessment,  complete  lung  function  measurements, high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax, and a 6-min walk test (6MWT). Based on the available data, in patients with severe and very severe airflow obstruction (i.e., GOLD stages 3 and 4 [forced expiratory volume in 1 s, FEV1 20-50%]) who are highly symptomatic (Grades C and D; CAT scores ≥ 10, Medical  Research  Council  scores ≥ 2;  hyperinflation  [RV ≥ 175% or RV/total lung capacity,  TLC ≥ 0.58]),  a  reduced 6MWD (100-450 m) may be considered for lung volume reduction therapies (Table 1, 2). When an elevated  right  ventricular  systolic  pressure  measured  by echocardiography  (> 50  mm  Hg)  is  identified,  a  right heart catheterization should be undertaken to rule out pulmonary hypertension (PH). In the case of severe PH, ELVR with coils, vapor, and sealants should be avoided. In selected cases with PH, EBV placement may be considered following multidisciplinary discussion [12]. Additionally, limited evidence has been published for successful  valve  treatment  in  emphysema patients with a FEV1 < 20% pred. [13, 14].",

      "title": "Radiological Assessment",
      "content": "Recommendations  for  radiological  assessment  are more or less unchanged. Standardized non-contrast volumetric CT scans are required to characterize the emphysema, degree of destruction on a lobar basis, evaluate distribution of the emphysema destruction, and determine the integrity of the lobar fissures. The CT protocol should be a standardized non-contrast volume acquisition on a multi-detector scanner platform with thin (0.6-1.25 mm) series with some overlap. The CT scan should come with smooth kernel reconstructions for quantitative CT analysis.  The primary assessment should also ensure the absence of significant co-morbidity or abnormalities that require further assessment [15]. If there are unexpected findings such as bronchiectasis, pulmonary nodules, suspected lung cancer, interstitial fibrosis, or severe tracheobronchomalacia that are identified on the screening highresolution  computer  tomography,  patients  should  be\nevaluated and treated based on the abnormality detected if considered clinically important [8].\nFocal areas of destruction of the alveolar tissue with the preservation of other areas is best described as localized  emphysema.  Emphysema  quantification  on  CT  is usually  expressed  as  the  proportion  of  pixels  less  than -910 or -950 Hounsfield Units (HU) [16]. The -910 HU density threshold is commonly used for thick-slice (> 3 mm) CT scans. This threshold yields the best correlation between emphysema as determined from resected lung tissue  and  10-mm-thick  slice  CT  measurements  [16]. With the advent of multi-slice scanners, also using volumetric  reconstructions,  the  density  thresholds  for  emphysema for different scan settings have been reinvestigated [17]. The strongest correlation between pathology of  macroscopic  and  microscopic  emphysema  and  CT measurements has been reported at a threshold of -950 HU in 1-mm non-contrast chest CT scans [16]. Several density thresholds have since been proposed for emphy-\nsema quantification, but for thin-slice volumetric chest CT scans, -950 HU is currently the most commonly used threshold.\nUsing emphysema quantification scores, a relative lobar difference of this measure is regarded as heterogeneity. This can be done by simple visual analysis, but more accurate results are produced using CT processing software. Heterogeneity is the relative or percentage difference in the emphysema scores between ipsilateral lobes. To date, no clear definition exists for heterogeneity. In most trials reported, a > 10-20% difference in the proportion of pixels of less than -910 HUs or a > 10% difference in the proportion of pixels of less than -950 HU has been used.\nA complete fissure or intact fissure, as determined via qualitative assessment of CT (QCT) scans, is thought to correspond  to  lack  of  inter-lobar  collateral  ventilation (CV)(Fig. 1).\nHigh-resolution  CT  fissure  analysis  has  been  performed for several years; however, only a few trials have focused on patients with emphysema. These studies demonstrate the difficulty of the fissure analysis that presupposes a high degree of experience. One of the major limitations of evaluating fissures on CT scans by the human eyes is its subjective nature and inconsistency in quantifying the degree of integrity. Semi-automated analysis evaluating the integrity of the fissure on a thin-slice CT scan has been developed by several companies. In a recently published paper by Koster et al. [18], CT data from four prospective studies were pooled and analyzed using semiautomated  software  to  quantify  the  completeness  of interlobar  fissures.  These  fissure  completeness  scores (FCSs) were compared to a reference standard of achieving ≥ 350 mL of target lobe volume reduction after EBV treatment. A subgroup of patients with partially complete fissures was identified where software had a lower accuracy, and the complementary value of Chartis was investigated in this group. A fissure was defined complete (FCS > 95%),  incomplete  (FCS  < 80%),  or  partially  complete (FCS between 80 and 95%). The positive predictive value of complete fissures was 88.1%, and the negative predictive value of incomplete fissures was 92.9%, with an overall accuracy of 89.2%. Chartis was utilized in patients with partially complete fissures, with a positive predictive value of 82.3%, a negative predictive value of 84.6%, and an accuracy of 83.3%.\nWhere there is partial integrity of the fissure (80-95% complete), a Chartis measurement is recommended by the panel. Above 95%, a Chartis is optional, while below 80% it is not useful to further evaluate a patient for treatment with valves [19]. A recent study by Welling et al.\n[20], showed no difference in outcomes in Chartis results between performing it under conscious sedation (spontaneous breathing) and general anesthesia, thus allowing easier procedures when performed under general anesthesia and best combined with the actual scheduled valve procedure. A possible algorithm for optimal patient selection is illustrated in Figure 2. The definition of a partially completed fissure is partly influenced by the used QCT software utilized, and hence the actual parameters may need to be adapted.",

      "content": "Update on EBVs\nOver the last year, several key papers have been published  [21-26].  One  of  the  major  publications  was  the multicenter RCT of Zephyr ® Endobronchial Valve Treatment in Heterogeneous Emphysema (LIBERATE) [27]. In the Liberate trial, 190 subjects were enrolled with a 2: 1 randomization (EBV: standard-of-care [SoC]) at 24 sites. Primary outcome at 12-months was the ΔEBV-SoC of subjects with a post-bronchodilator FEV1 improvement from  baseline  of ≥ 15%.  Secondary  endpoints  included absolute  changes  in  post-BD  FEV1,  6MWD,  and  St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) scores. At 12 months, subjects with 47.7% EBV and 16.8% SoC had a ΔFEV1 ≥ 15% ( p < 0.001). ΔEBV-SoC at 12 months was statistically  and  clinically  significant:  FEV 1 (L),  0.106L ( p <  0.001); 6MWD, +39.31 m ( p =  0.002); and SGRQ, -7.05 points ( p = 0.004). Significant ΔEBV-SoC were also observed in hyperinflation (RV, -522ml; p < 0.001), modified Medical Research Council, -0.8 points ( p < 0.001), and the BODE Index (-1.2 points). Pneumothorax was the most common serious adverse event (SAE) during the treatment period (procedure to 45 days) in 34/128 (26.6%) EBV subjects. Four deaths occurred in the EBV group during  this  phase,  and  one  each  in  the  EBV  and  SoC groups between 46 days and 12 months.\nThe study confirmed that the Zephyr EBV provides clinically meaningful benefits in lung function, exercise tolerance, dyspnea, and quality of life (QOL) for up to at least 12 months and with an acceptable safety profile in patients with little or no CV in the target lobe.\nIntrabronchial Valve (Called 'Spiration ® Valve System' - SVS since 2018)\nAt the ERS meetings in Milan (2017) and Paris (2018), the 12-month results of the SVS RCTs have been presented. In Milan, Wang et al. [28] presented the results of 66\npatients  randomized  to  active  treatment  versus  35  patients to the standard-of-care REACH study. In this study, at  12  months,  the  valve-treated  patients  showed  very modest improvements in FEV1 (+40 mL), SGRQ (-3.8 points), and 6MWD (+4.5 m). Criner et al. [29] presented the 12-month data of the Emprove trial. This was a multicenter, prospective RCT undertaken at 31 centers in the USA and Canada to assess the safety and effectiveness of the SVS compared to standard medical care. A total of 172 subjects, were randomized in a 2: 1 allocation ratio to either the SVS treatment group ( n =  113)  or  the  control group ( n =  59).  The  SVS treatment resulted in a mean target  lobe  volume  reduction  of  974  mL  (52.8%)  at  6 months, with the primary endpoint, FEV1, reaching statistically  and  clinically  meaningful  differences  between the  study  groups.  At  12  months,  the  valve  group  improved  in  FEV1  (+99  mL),  SGRQ  (-9.5  points),  and 6MWD (+6.9 m). Pneumothorax and exacerbations of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were the most reported complications.",

      "title": "Management of Complications",
      "content": "Pneumothorax is the most frequent complication following insertion of either valve device and is more prev-\nalent in the presence of lobar atelectasis. Hence, to some extent, it is more often associated with technical success. The recent clinical trials have reinforced the finding that the complication is more frequent within the first 3 days after valve insertion [30-33]. Hence, it is important that these patients are admitted to and monitored in a hospital for at least 3 days after valve insertion. Simple intercostal drainage is sufficient in most instances of pneumothorax. If the air leak is moderate with the lung up against the chest wall, simple chest tube drainage or use of an ambulatory drain (with a Heimlich valve) should be considered. In situations where there is a sustained high-flow air leak from the intercostal drain, removal of a single valve should be considered. If this still does not resolve the issue, a further option that may be considered is the removal of all valves. Finally, thoracoscopic  intervention  may  be  required.  The  management  of pneumothorax is discussed in more detail by Valipour et al. [34].",

      "title": "ELVR and Survival",
      "content": "In the last months, several retrospective analyses have been published reviewing the previously published evi-\ndence [35-37]. The most important review focuses on a survival paper by Gompelmann et al. [36]. She followed 449 emphysema patients who underwent EBV therapy for a mean time of 37.3 ± 21.3 months.\nA total of 128 patients (29%) developed complete lobar atelectasis; 34 out of these also experienced a pneumothorax.  Fifty  patients  (11%)  developed  a  pneumothorax without lobar atelectasis  and  261  patients  (58%)  target lobe  volume  reduction  or  no  volume  change.  Patients with EBV-induced lobar atelectasis had a significant survival  benefit  compared  to  patients  without  atelectasis ( p = 0.009; 5-year survival rate 65.3 vs. 43.9%). The advent of  pneumothorax in 84 patients did not influence survival ( p = 0.52). The authors were able to show that lobar atelectasis following endoscopic valve therapy is associated with a survival benefit.\nCoils\nBesides the existing evidence [38-41], two of the RCTs have published additional data. The multicenter randomized trial performed in France, which recruited 100 patients (Revolens trial [42]), evaluated the efficacy, safety, cost, and cost-effectiveness of nitinol coils in the treatment of severe  emphysema compared with usual care. The 2-year data has shown that coil placement is associated with sustained improvements in the QOL, sustained decreases in RV, and an acceptable safety profile with no late-onset or unanticipated events occurring in the posttreatment  period.  At  2  years,  both  RV  and  SGRQ  improvements  remained  significant,  whereas  the  6MWT, modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale, and FEV1 were not statistically different from baseline. This must be considered in the context of severely affected patients with emphysema who are deteriorating over time. There were 45 SAEs in 26 patients within the first year (0.9 SAEs per patient-year), and 27 SAEs in 20 patients over the second year (0.44 SAEs per patient-year). SAEs between the 1- and 2-year follow-up included 18 respiratory  events  (12  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  exacerbations,  4  pneumonias,  1 lung transplant, and 1 lung nodule). No unexpected SAEs were observed between 1 and 2 years of follow-up.\nThe RENEW trial data set has been analyzed in more detail [43]. At the ERS meeting in 2017, Slebos et al. [41] presented a post hoc analysis of the RENEW trial, which was  undertaken  to  identify  parameters  associated  with superior 12-month clinical outcomes. A group of patients with a high baseline RV (> 200%), a higher emphysema score (> 20%), LAA, and the absence of airways disease was  identified  that  received  bilateral  treatment  of  the lobes  with  greatest  ipsilateral  emphysematous  destruc-\ntion, as determined by quantitative CT analysis. In that subgroup, greater lobar RV reduction in the treated lobes was achieved, which was associated with a significant improvement in FEV1 (+15,2%, SE 3.1), SGRQ (-12 points, SE 2), and RV (-0.57L, SE 0.13) from baseline values. The ELEVATE study is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized (2: 1), controlled trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of endobronchial coils in patients selected on the basis of the post hoc analysis. The trial aims to enroll 210 patients (140 treatment, 70 control) with severe emphysema with a RV > 200% pred. The patients will undergo quantitative CT analysis followed by a formal radiological screen to ensure that only patients with dominant  emphysema and minimal airways disease  are  enrolled.  Furthermore,  the  clinical  history,  medications, pulmonary function, and CT scans will be scrutinized by at least two members of an eligibility committee prior to randomization. The purpose of this rigorous process is to ensure that only patients who are deemed to be optimal responders  are  recruited  to  standardize  recruitment. Control patients will be eligible to crossover to coil treatment after 6 months of follow-up. The co-primary effectiveness endpoints are percent change in FEV1 from baseline  to  6  months and QOL measured by the change in SGRQ from baseline to 6 months. All patients (initially treated and cross-over) will be followed for 24 months after initial treatment. Adverse events will be collected on an ongoing basis throughout the study. The first patients have already been enrolled.\nThe panel expected possible additional predictors as an outcome of this ongoing trial and long-term data information from the initial trials. Therefore, at present, the recommendation is to use the endobronchial coils only in patients with a RV > 225%.\nPatients need to have significant emphysema (LAA > 20% at 950 HU), be limited by hyperinflation (RV > 225% pred. and RV/TLC > 58), and show no signs of significant airway wall thickening, bronchiectasis, or clinically significant chronic bronchitis.",

      "content": "Bronchoscopic  thermal  vapor  ablation  (BTVA,  Uptake Medical Corporation, Seattle, WA, USA) creates a volume reduction by the instillation of heated water in the most destroyed lobe. An inflammatory response is focally induced, which provokes irreversible parenchymal fibrosis and scarring and thus targeted lung reduction in emphysematous tissue.\nNo addition evidence is available for thermal vapor ablation;  hence  the  evidence  is  still  based  on  the  step-up\ntrial conducted in upper-lobe-predominant disease [44, 45]. In this trial, the researchers compared thermal vapor ablation  with  standard  medical  management  and  were able to show that targeted thermal vapor ablation of more diseased  segments  whilst  preserving  less  diseased  segments resulted in clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in lung function and QOL at 6 and 12 months, with an acceptable safety profile.\nThe limitation of targeted thermal vapor ablation is the restriction  to  patients  with  upper-lobe,  heterogeneous disease. At this time, the panel recommends the therapy only for those patients and to be performed only in clinical trials. Trials in patients with homogeneous and lowerlobe disease have already begun, and the results are expected by late 2019.",

      "content": "Biological  lung  volume  reduction,  using  the  lung sealant system (AeriSeal), is another irreversible ELVR technique  that  employs  a  synthetic  polymer  to  block small airways and collateral channels while promoting atelectasis, remodeling, and scar formation. Since 2017, no  new  data  has  been  published.  All  published  trials [46-48]  confirmed  that  treatment  of  up  to  3  subsegments during a single session was safe and that bilateral therapy for 4 or more subsegments over 2 separate sessions  was  associated  with  therapeutic  benefit  beyond that achieved with 2- or 3-site therapy, with no emergent safety issues. Based upon these observations, it was hypothesized  that  an  improved  risk/benefit  could  be achieved by performing 4-site therapy during a single session  in  patients  with  advanced  homogeneous  and heterogeneous emphysema. Furthermore, it was noted that patients with baseline DLCO 20-60% pred. benefited the  most from the treatment and that outcomes were better following upper-lobe treatment. It was thus hypothesized that limiting the treatment to patients with DLCO 20-60% pred. and acceptable treatment sites in the upper lobes could improve responses to treatment. The technology is currently undergoing further evaluation  (NCT02877459) and can only be used in clinical trials in well-selected centers.",

      "content": "An initial consensus meeting followed by further panel discussions led to the development of the original algorithm in 2016 [7]. The actual updated algorithm for the advanced treatment of severe emphysema patients, based on the above presented literature, is presented in Figure 2. Following the recent GOLD recommendation, possible\npatients should be on optimal pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment. Active smoking is still a clear contraindication in the opinion of the panel members. Following  the  recommendation  from  2016,  patients should have significant hyperinflation measured in the lung function by body plethysmography. A non-contrast thin-slice volume CT scan should be performed, and any relevant findings must be reported and co-existent disease identified. All suitable patients should be presented to a multidisciplinary team discussion including radiologists, pulmonologists, thoracic surgeons as well as an interventional pulmonologist.\nUnchanged  from  2016  for  all  patients  is  that  lung transplantation should be considered as an option. If so, a connection or easy access to a lung transplantation program is recommended. The option of transplantation is not a contraindication for ELVR [49], and the techniques can be used as a bridging strategy.\nOnly LVRS and EBVs reached the evidence level to be used outside clinical trials. The current evidence suggests that the degree of volume reduction is directly correlated to the magnitude of benefit, and therefore, the technique most likely to induce volume reduction in a particular patient should be considered [11]. Patients who are not suitable for EBVs or LVRS should be enrolled into the numerous active clinical trials with endobronchial coils, vapor, or sealants. Broader treatment has demonstrated new  challenges  and  unusual  complications,  and  hence clinical experience should be concentrated on the early phase of introduction of these therapies. Therefore, the panel also advises that patients should be treated in expert/high-volume centers, which are participating in clinical  trials  and  registries  to  capture  all  treatments  when performed outside clinical trials.",
