      "title": "Introduction",
      "content": "Laryngotracheal stenosis remains a therapeutic challenge clinically. One major factor is restenosis following laryngotracheoplasty in a significant proportion of patients. Laryngotracheoplasty with T-tube placement is a simple method for treating laryngotracheal stenosis. The T-tube was first developed by Montgomery   [1] in 1965 for treating tracheal stenosis. According to Pereszlenyi et al.   [2]  , common indications for T-tube placement include: (1) temporary placement before segmental tracheal resection due to complex tracheal injury, apparent tracheal inflammation, or tracheal and esophageal fistula; (2) temporary placement following segmental tracheal resection due to unreliable suture (apparent inflammation and high tension) as a precautionary measure against tracheal restenosis, inadequate anastomosis of the tracheal end, the presence of free edges, restenosis, or subglottic stenosis; (3) placement as a single measure for unresectable tumor, long stenosis, stenosis of multiple segments, or other problems that render segmental tracheal resection impossible (fibrosis and inflammation). According to Wahidi and Ernst   [3]  , T-tubes can be placed temporarily before eventual reconstruction surgery in patients with active concurrent disease or severe systemic disease that prolongs intensive care unit stay or in patients with a recent episode of tracheal trauma or infection. T-tubes can be used as a complementary measure to promote mucosal recovery following repair including tracheal reconstruction and end-to-end anastomosis after segmental tracheal resection. Furthermore, T-tubes can be used therapeutically to prevent the occurrence of complications such as partial dehiscence and restenosis following failed surgical reconstruction. They can also be placed as a therapeutic measure for patients with a poor systemic condition that does not allow surgery or a tracheal injury that cannot be repaired because of its length and relation with adjacent structures. According to Puma et al. [4]  , T-tubes can be placed as a temporary support in the presence of excessive scar tissue or apparent inflammation in the tracheal mucosa until the condition of the patient allows partial tracheotomy. It is advisable that tracheotomy be not performed until the resolution of the inflammation and improvement of the overall condition of the patient. It usually takes approximately 6 months for an inflammation to be completely resolved. Liu et al.   [5] believed that T-tubes can be placed for a longer period of time or permanently if there is a long segment of stenosis or if tracheal malacia is present. It has been reported that for stenosed segments >6 cm, T-tubes can be placed for a longer term. Similar indications for T-tubes have been described by other investigators   [6-8]  .\nThe tube is inserted into the upper trachea or larynx following trauma or surgery to serve as a means to maintain the tracheal airway as well as serving as a stent. According to the degree of the laryngotracheal stenosis, the T-tube is extubated 6-12 months after laryngotracheal placement, which could promote epithelialization of the laryngotracheal mucosa and avoid laryngotracheal stenosis. Indications for T-tube placement included temporary intubation before segmental tracheal resection, complex tracheal injury, obvious tracheal inflammation, and tracheoesophageal fistula. Puma et al.   [4] believe that when there is an apparent inflammation in the mucosal tissues or when there is excessive scar tissue, a T-tube can be placed to provide temporary tracheal support until the condition of the patient has improved and tracheostomy can be undertaken. In general, it takes approximately 6 months for inflammation to subside in the tracheal mucosa. Liu et al.   [5] think that T-tube placement can be regarded as a temporary measure before trachea reconstruction to lessen tracheal mucosal inflammation. If tracheal stenosis or malacia is present over an extended period of time, some investigators   [6-8]   may also consider permanent T-tube placement.\nIn the current study, we retrospectively analyzed the outcome and safety of T-tube placement for 546 patients with laryngotracheal stenosis who received treatment between May 1996 and May 2010 at our institution with extubation rate as the primary endpoint of the study.\nORL 2014;76:314-320",

T-tubes had three sizes: 10, 12, and 14 mm in diameter. The size was chosen considering age, sex, body height and preoperative bronchoscopy and tracheal CT findings to select a tube of appropriate diameter and length for the patients. Tubes of 14 mm in diameter were generally used for adult males, 12 mm for adult females, and 10 mm for youths and adolescents. The tube length was adjusted during placement and was generally 1 cm more than the length of the stenosis. The T-tube was placed after laryngotracheofissure. Normal mucosa was preserved as much as possible, scar tissue was excised, and fractured cartilage underwent anatomic reduction. The T-tube should be placed 1.0 cm beyond both sides of the stenosis. For patients with apparent laryngeal stenosis, T-tube placement was done with laryngofissure. For patients with an apparent scar in the vocal area, T-tube placement was carried out after laser removal of the scar under a laryngoscope. In case of apparent subglottic stenosis hindering T-tube placement, cricoidectomy and laryngofissure were carried out before tube placement. In cases with an inadequate transverse diameter after cricoidectomy, the cricoid cartilage arch was widened with the hyoid bone. In patients with bilateral vocal cord paralysis, arytenoidectomy was performed using laser under a laryngoscope along with T-tube placement.",

      "content": "Laryngotracheal stents keep the airway expanded after surgical reconstruction or trauma by providing support and immobilization of cartilage grafts and mucosal flaps to the recipient site and maintaining the lumen in the reconstructed airway that temporarily lacks adequate support. On the other hand, laryngeal stents act as foreign bodies in the reconstructed airway and  may  cause  mucosal  injuries,  ulcerations,  granulation  tissue  formation  and  subsequent restenosis.  If  a  laryngotracheal  stent  does  not  conform  anatomically  to  the  inner  laryngeal contours or if it is inadvertently damaged and not promptly repaired, granulation and scar formation will ensue, leading to laryngotracheal stenosis. A great majority of our patients in the current  series  suffered  laryngotracheal  stenosis  due  to  trauma.  In  such  patients,  prompt cricotracheal  resection  and  laryngeal  mucous  membrane  reduction  are  frequently  not performed, leading to laryngotracheal granulation and scar formation and ultimately laryngotracheal stenosis. In some neck trauma patients who develop severe breathing difficulty or even asphyxiation,  the  laryngotracheal  stent  may  be  inadvertently  damaged  during  emergency tracheostomy and cricothyrotomy, but laryngotracheal repair is not promptly carried out after the  breathing  difficulty  is  alleviated.  Therefore,  for  patients  with  neck  trauma  or  laryngeal injury, prompt reduction of laryngeal cartilages and mucous membrane should be undertaken to prevent the development of laryngotracheal stenosis. In addition, regardless of the causes of laryngotracheal stenosis, the second extubation rate in our patients was lower than the initial extubation rate. This may be due to granulation in patients receiving a second intubation. T-tube placement represents a surgical insult; granulation may occur as a result, and second intubation may aggravate granulation in the patients, rendering extubation difficult.\nManagement of laryngotracheal stenosis includes dilation, laser therapy, and laryngotracheal reconstruction. However, there is currently a lack of an effective method for severe laryngotracheal stenosis. Laryngotracheoplasty with T-tube placement is a simple method for treating laryngotracheal stenosis. A large number of investigators consider that partial tracheostomy and end-to-end anastomosis should be undertaken first if the condition of the patients permits it   [10, 11]  . When there is active local laryngotracheal granulation or the general condition of the patients does not permit it, T-tube placement can be an effective temporary  measure  before  trachea  reconstruction.  Recently,  some  investigators  have reported that T-tube intubation can be a long-term or permanent measure. In our laryngotracheal stenosis patients, the higher the Cotton-Myer staging grades, the lower the successful\na p < 0.05 among the four groups;  b  p < 0.05 versus initial extubation;  c p > 0.05 versus initial extubation. Figures are numbers with percentages in parentheses.\nORL 2014;76:314-320\nDOI: 10.1159/000362244\nextubation rates. Among various types of stenosis, tracheal stenosis had the highest extubation rate, laryngeal stenosis had the second highest extubation rate, and laryngotracheal stenosis had the lowest extubation rate. Among cases of stenosis of various causes, chemical burn-induced laryngotracheal stenosis had the lowest extubation rate, which may be related to the extent of the stenosis and scar growth. That patients with laryngotracheal stenosis due to chemical burns, patients with laryngotracheal stenosis and patients with higher CottonMyer grades exhibited a lower extubation rate may be explained by the fact that the stenosed segments were longer, or that there was more extensive mucosal injury, hindering epithelialization. As a result, even after 1 year of intubation with a T-tube, granulation tended to occur following extubation. A longer segment of stenosed trachea or malacia may also be present in chemical burn-induced laryngotracheal stenosis. If the stenosed segment is longer than 6 cm, if there is apparent inflammation of the tracheal mucosa or if there is excessive scar tissue, a T-tube can be placed to provide temporary support for the trachea until the condition of the patients allows tracheostomy. It may be prudent to wait until the inflammation around the tracheal stenosis has lessened and the general condition of the patients has improved.\nT-tube placement is not a complicated procedure and inadvertent maneuvering may result in obvious discomfort of patients and even death if the procedure fails. One serious complication of the procedure is laryngeal obstruction, which could lead to asphyxiation. One major cause of laryngeal obstruction is laryngotracheal granulation, which is due to an inappropriate diameter of  the  T-tube,  improper  positioning  of  the  T-tube  or  lack  of  perfect  anatomical  conformity. Laryngotracheal granulation is also an important cause of ineffective control of laryngotracheal stenosis following extubation. Displacement of the T-tube also causes laryngeal obstruction as the tube moves up or down in the trachea, mechanically irritating the tracheal mucosa, which can lead to recurrent coughing and tracheal bleeding. Fifteen (8%) patients in our series had apparent hemoptysis, and 3 of them required a second surgery. Common bleeding sites include the mucosa of the stenosed segment or the mucosa at the inferior end of the T-tube.\nIn  conclusion,  this  large  clinical  series  demonstrates  the  safety  and  effectiveness  of T-tubes for grade 1 and 2 stenosis with stenosed segments being <6 cm. For those being >6 cm, tracheal end-to-end anastomosis is not appropriate and long-term placement of a T-tube is recommended. Our findings provide useful guidance for preoperatively selecting patients  with  laryngotracheal  stenosis  of  various  causes  and  differing  severity.  However, given the retrospective and single-center nature of our study, these findings need to be further confirmed by prospective multicenter studies involving a larger patient population.",
