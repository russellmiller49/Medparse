Failure of IET may lead to delayed care and increased length of stay. Objectives: The goal of this study was to identify risk factors for failure of IET. Methods: We performed a multicenter, retrospective study of patients who received IET for the treatment of CPPE/empyema. Clinical and radiological variables at the time of diagnosis were included. We compared four different machine learning classifiers (L1-penalized logistic regression, support vector machine [SVM], extreme gradient boosting [XGBoost], and light gradient-boosting machine [LightGBM]) by multiple bootstrap-validated metrics, including Fb , to demonstrate model performances. Results: A total of 466 participants who received IET for pleural infection were included from five institutions across the United States. Resolution of CPPE/empyema with IET was achieved in 78% ( n =365). SVM performed superiorly, with median Fb of 56%, followed by L1-penalized logistic regression, LightGBM, and XGBoost. Clinical and radiological variables were graded based on their ranked variable importance. The top two significant predictors of IET failure using SVM were the presence of an abscess/necrotizing pneumonia (17%) and pleural thickening (13%). Similarly, LightGBM identified abscess/necrotizing pneumonia (35%) and pleural thickening (26%) and XGBoost indicated pleural thickening (36%) and abscess/necrotizing pneumonia (17%) as the most significant predictors of treatment failure. Predictors identified by the L1-penalized logistic regression model were pleural thickening (18%) and pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (9%). Conclusions: The presence of abscess/necrotizing pneumonia and pleural thickening consistently ranked among the strongest predictors of IET failure in all machine learning models. The difference in rankings between models may be a consequence of the different algorithms used by each model. These results indicate that the presence of abscess/necrotizing pneumonia and pleural thickening may predict IET failure. These results should be confirmed in larger studies. This was a retrospective multicenter study conducted in /uniFB01 ve institutions across the United States and included consecutive patients who underwent IET for CPPE/empyema management between January 2012 and February 2020.

The cornerstones of management are prompt drainage of the infected pleural space and initiation of antimicrobial therapy (2). Intrapleural enzyme therapy (IET), with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and DNase (DNase), has been shown to break down /uniFB01 brin in CPPE/empyema and facilitate drainage. IET has been shown to improve radiographic outcomes, decrease hospital length of stay, and reduce the need for surgical intervention in the MIST2 (MultiCentre Intrapleural Sepsis 2) trial (3). This therapy has become the standard of care for management of dif /uniFB01 cult-to-drain CPPE and empyema. There is increasing evidence that demonstrates ef /uniFB01 cacy, with treatment success rates of 90% despite variation in dosage and method of administration (4 -6).\nDespite appropriate medical therapy, surgical intervention continues to play a crucial role in cases where pleural infection has not been effectively controlled. However, the role of surgical intervention remains unclear, with much of the debate revolving around patient selection (7, 8). In addition, patients with later stages of empyema with an organized pleural thickening are less likely to achieve lung reexpansion without surgery (9). Current guidelines recommend the use of surgery in cases of ' medical treatment failure ' or when an advanced /uniFB01 brotic state is suspected with extensive pleural thickening (2). For patients in whom intrapleural tPA/DNase therapy is likely to fail, IET may simply delay surgical referral. It is important for clinicians to identify the patients in whomIET with tPA/DNase is likely to fail, facilitating early surgical intervention. The study used supervised machine learning with extreme gradient boosting to investigate the relative importance of predictors of IET failure among patients with pleural infection. Pleural thickening and the presence of abscess/necrotizing pneumonia have been identi /uniFB01 ed as the most important predictors of IET failure in a single-center study using supervised machine learning with extreme gradient boosting (10).\nMachine learning has been used to analyze large amounts of data and identify patterns that can predict outcomes in patients with respiratory disease (11). Machine learning involves training algorithms to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. Several studies have\ntrained the algorithms on the data from electronic health records that contained information such as patient demographics, medical history, and laboratory values. The machine learning models used in these studies were able to accurately predict outcomes, such as mortality and exacerbation, in patients with respiratory disease with high accuracy, outperforming traditional scoring systems (12 -14). This suggests that machine learning has the potential to improve patient outcomes by identifying high-risk patients early and developing personalized treatment plans.\nTo further evaluate the effectiveness of this predictive model, we performed a retrospective, multicenter study to determine the signi /uniFB01 cance of candidate variables in predicting IET failure among patients with pleural infection.",

      "content": "Simple descriptive statistics were used to describe patient demographics. Categorical variables were summarized using frequencies with percentages. Continuous variables were displayed as mean and standard deviation when normally distributed or median and interquartile range (IQR) if appropriate. The study included a total of 466 subjects who were randomly divided into training ( n =372) and testing ( n =94) sets at an 80:20 ratio. The dataset contained missing values for 5 out of 14 clinical variables, namely chest tube size, pleural /uniFB02 uid glucose, LDH, protein, and pH. Binary variables were created to\nindicate when an observation required imputation for a given missing variable. The missing values in the dataset were imputed using the multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE) technique and binary variables (15, 16), which involves estimating the missing values for each variable by using other variables in the dataset as predictors. This method was implemented iteratively, with each iteration improving the estimation of missing values based on information gained in the previous iteration. After imputing missing data using MICE, the resulting dataset was used for further analysis or modeling.\nThe training data were further divided into in-bag and out-of-bag training data (using the same ratio) for hyperparameter tuning. Adaptive optimization (treeparzan estimator) was used to tune the hyperparameters for each of the four different machine learning classi /uniFB01 ers: L1-penalized logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and light gradientboosting machine (LightGBM) to maximize out-of-bag Fb . Finally, each model was /uniFB01 tted to the full training data using the tuned hyperparameter values. The goal of hyperparameter tuning was to /uniFB01 nd the optimal set of hyperparameters for each classi /uniFB01 er that maximized its performance on the out-of-bag training data. Once the hyperparameters were tuned using the\nout-of-bag training data, each model was /uniFB01 tted to the full training data using the optimal set of hyperparameters. This /uniFB01 nal step ensured that the models were trained on the complete training dataset with the optimal set of hyperparameters, which could then be used to make predictions on new data (17 -20).\nOnce each model was tuned and /uniFB01 t, model performance was assessed on the testing data ( n =94) in terms of Fb (a weighted version of the F-1 score). To address the challenges associated with a limited sample size and to mitigate over /uniFB01 tting, we integrated several advanced machine learning techniques into our methodology, including cross-validation, regularization, and bootstrapping. Variable importance was estimated by random permutation to rank the importance of clinical and derived variables with respect to their in /uniFB02 uence on failure of IET. The F-1 score is the harmonic mean of precision (true predictive value) and recall (true positive rate) (21 -23). In clinical practice, delaying surgical intervention in the setting of ongoing or inadequately drained pleural space infection can be harmful to the patients, which may lead to worsening sepsis or increasing risk of complications. Therefore, this study weighted recall twice as heavily as precision. In other words, we scored model performance by prioritizing recall over precision. The whole pipeline was\nrepeated 200 times (from random split to Fb and area under the curve testing) to yield valid distributions for test metrics.",

Among 466 patients, 37.1% ( n =173) received appropriate antibiotics, ensuring that the prescribed antibiotics matched the sensitivity of their microbiology culture results. Small-bore catheters (8 -18 F) were placed in 413 (88.6%) patients, whereas 53 (11.4%) had large chest drains (20 -32 F). Chest drains were placed percutaneously with image guidance in 438 (94%) subjects.

      "content": "To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date to determine the predictors of IET failure in pleural infection. Our dataset represents the experiences of /uniFB01 ve institutions with different practice settings over an 8-year period, including two university-based and three community-based practices. We observed an overall success rate of 78.3%. In comparison, other studies have reported success rates ranging from 85% to 92% (24 -27). IET has proven effective in decreasing the necessity for surgical intervention in patients with CPPE/ empyema (3). However, some cases still require surgery, despite completing a complete course of IET. Identifying risk factors for the failure of combined intrapleural therapy is vital in clinical practice and may aid in identi /uniFB01 cation of high-risk patients who need prompt surgical intervention instead.\nIn a previous retrospective study, machine learning with extreme gradient boosting was used to assess the relative importance of predictors for IET failure, identifying pleural thickening and abscess/necrotizing pneumonia as the most signi /uniFB01 cant predictors (10). In this multicenter study, four machine learning models were used to rank a wide range of clinical and radiological variables that contribute to IET failure.\nThe presence of abscess/necrotizing pneumonia and pleural thickening consistently ranked among the top two predictors of IET failure across three machine learning models (all except\nDefinition of abbreviations : IET = intrapleural enzyme therapy; MRSA = methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ; MSSA=methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus . Data are given as n (%).\nL1-penalized logistic regression). The different rankings between models may be attributed to the varying algorithms used by each model. These results suggest that the presence of abscess/necrotizing pneumonia and pleural thickening strongly increases the risk of intrapleural IET failure. Hence, expedited surgical management may need to be considered for patients with these /uniFB01 ndings to prevent the potential failure of IET and delayed control of infection.\nModel selection is a challenging process of choosing proper machine learning models among many candidates for predicting a speci /uniFB01 c outcome. In addition to model performance, there are other competing priorities during model selection, such as complexity, maintainability, and explainability (28). Overly simpli /uniFB01 ed or complicated models commonly lead to suboptimal model performance. Therefore, the optimal model should have just enough complexity, and no more. Attempts to develop a model that works in all cases have failed (29). Alas, with each new problem and each new dataset, data scientists must go through the tedious and sometimes laborious process of /uniFB01 nding the right-sized model for the analysis of interest. To this end, we\ncompared three different classes of models with three different levels of complexity: 1 ) L1-penalized logistic regression, which is relatively low complexity; 2 ) nonlinear SVM, which is marginally more complex; and 3 ) gradient boosted models, which served as our most complex models in this study. Wecompared two implementations of gradient boosted models, XGBoost and LightGBM, because these two models differ with respect to their speed of calculation. Because LightGBM builds histograms for all features in the dataset and uses these histograms to /uniFB01 nd the best split points, it results in a faster training time (18).",

      "content": "This study has several strengths. Its multicenter design improves the generalizability of the results across different practice settings, and it validates the signi /uniFB01 cance of the identi /uniFB01 ed predictors, which were detected in a smaller singlecenter study using a similar technique (10). Moreover, our cohort ' s data collection spanned over a long period of time, allowing for a more comprehensive analysis of the study outcomes. We aimed to collect a broad range of data to analyze and\nidentify the clinical parameters that can predict the failure of IET. The study ' s external validity is robust because of the high rates of data completeness and the identical collection of datasets across multiple centers, despite a few parameters with missing data. We used MICE to iteratively impute the missing data, which is capable of managing missing data from diverse sources, a notable advantage (15). This is achieved by using a series of regression models to approximate missing values, enabling it to comprehend the correlations between variables, even in cases where missing data exist in multiple variables (30, 31). This study had a few limitations. Although IET failure was de /uniFB01 ned as the lack of resolution of CPPE/empyema on chest CT or the occurrence of any complication, the decision for surgical intervention was based on local clinical practices, which could have introduced selection bias. However, conducting the study across multiple centers helped mitigate the in /uniFB02 uence of local practices and ensured broader applicability of the /uniFB01 ndings. Another limitation was the retrospective design, which may lead to biases inherent in such studies. The results should be validated in prospective studies.\nDefinition of abbreviations : LDH=lactate dehydrogenase; XGBoost=extreme gradient boosting.\nThe Fb score is a performance metric that assesses a model by combining precision and recall in a flexible manner.
