    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The eighth edition of lung cancer nodal staging assignment includes the location of lymph node metastasis, but does not include single-nodal and multiple-nodal descriptors. RESEARCH QUESTION: Do the single-nodal and multiple-nodal statuses stratify the prognosis of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Using the National Cancer Database, we analyzed patients with pathologically staged N1 and N2 NSCLC. Nodal descriptors were classified into pathological single N1 (pSingle-N1), pathological multiple N1 (pMulti-N1), pathological single N2 (pSingle-N2), and pathological multiple N2 (pMulti-N2). Survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and multivariable Cox regression models. RESULTS: In the general analysis cohort, 24,531, 22,256, 8,528, and 21,949 patients with NSCLC demonstrated pSingle-N1, pMulti-N1, pSingle-N2, and pMulti-N2 disease, respectively. Patients with pMulti-N1 and pMulti-N2 disease showed a shorter survival than those with pSingle-N1 and pSingle-N2 disease, respectively (hazard ratio, 1.22 [P < .0001] for N1 and 1.39 [P < .0001] for N2). After adjusting age, sex, and histologic findings, the hazard ratio for pSingle-N2 compared with pMulti-N1 disease was 1.05 (P = .0031). Patients with pN1 disease were categorized by metastatic lymph node count (1, 2, 3, ≥ 4), showing significant prognostic differences among groups (P < .0001). In the sensitivity analysis cohort (limited to R0 resection, lobectomy, or more; survival ≥ 30 days; ≥ 10 examined lymph nodes; and without neoadjuvant therapy; n = 34,904) and the external validation cohort (n = 708), analyses supported these results. INTERPRETATION: Patients with NSCLC with one metastatic lymph node, whether in N1 or N2 stations, showed better survival than those with more than one lymph node involved. Patients with NSCLC with a single-skip N2 lymph node metastasis showed survival similar to patients with multiple N1 lymph nodes, and the number of lymph nodes involved in N1 resections up to four or more was sequentially prognostic.",

However, in other malignancies, pathologic nodal classi /uniFB01 cation is assigned depending on the number of lymph nodes with histologic metastases. 5,6 The purpose of this retrospective study was to investigate whether nodal descriptors re /uniFB02 ecting the number of metastatic lymph nodes accurately re /uniFB02 ect postoperative prognosis in patients with resected Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using the National Cancer Database (NCDB).",

      "content": "The stage of disease is important in predicting the prognosis of patients with Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the current study, multivariable analyses con /uniFB01 rmed a signi /uniFB01 cant association between pN status in four categories and OS (Table 2). Results from the validation analysis using data from three facilities in Japan supported the /uniFB01 ndings (e-Fig 6). Of note, the number of patients with NCDB in this study was larger than that used in the previous IASLC lung database (seventh edition analysis). 8 Previous studies reported a potential bene /uniFB01 t of combining the number of metastatic lymph nodes and their anatomic locations for prognostic information. 7,9,10 In a previous Japan Lung Cancer Registry Joint\n]\n(Continued)\nCommittee database study, Yoshino et al 10 reported that patients with Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with multistation N2 disease showed a signi /uniFB01 cantly worse prognosis than those with single-station N2 disease (5-year survival rate, 22.0% vs 35.8%, respectively). Asamura et al 7 reported similar results, showing that patients with Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with multistation N2 disease showed a signi /uniFB01 cantly shorter OS compared with those with single-station N2 disease (5-year survival rate, 38% vs 49%, respectively). Additionally, patients with Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with multistation N1 disease showed a signi /uniFB01 cantly shorter OS compared with those with single-station N1 disease (5-year survival rate, 50% vs 59%, respectively), and those with multistation N1 disease showed an OS comparable with that of those with single-station N2 disease (5-year survival rate, 50% and 49%, respectively). In that study, most of the data were derived from Japan, with 23,012 patients (59.1%) with cN status and 23,463 patients (74.7%) with pN status. Therefore, the Naruke-Japanese map was used in most patients to designate the location of metastatic lymph nodes and to determine nodal status. 11 The number of data submitted from the United States was small, with 861 patients (2.2%) with cN status and 2,291 patients (7.3%) with pN status. In our study, the number of patients with Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with pN1-2 disease from the United States was 77,264 patients in the general analysis cohort (Fig 1) and 34,904 patients in the sensitivity analysis cohort (e-Fig 1), compared with 8,333 patients with Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) analyzed by Asamura et al. 7\nThe IASLC Lung Cancer Staging Project recently proposed the revision of the nodal descriptors in the forthcoming ninth edition of the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation of lung cancer. 12 In this revision, the newly established database consisted of 87,043 patients with the data on valid histologic type, survival time, date of diagnosis window, and clinical and pathologic stages. 13 Of the total patients, 10,187 patients(11.7%) were from the United States. The IASLC Lung Cancer Staging Project proposed the addition of new subdescriptors to N2 for single-station involvement (N2a) and multiple-station\ninvolvement (N2b) based on the results showing that prognostic differences between N2a and N2b involvement were observed consistently across each subgroup in accordance with completeness of resection, histologic type, T category, and geographic region. In the current study, it was ideal to analyze pN2a2 and pN2b involvement separately; however, because of lack of station information, NCDB could distinguish only pN2a1 from pN2 involvement. Thus, the NCDB showed the prognostic difference only between pSingle-N2 (pN2a1) and pMulti-N2 (pN2a2 plus pN2b) involvement. Regarding the prognostic difference between pN2a and pN2b involvement, analysis of the validation cohort including 708 patients showed that patients with pN2b disease showed a signi /uniFB01 cantly shorter OS compared with those with pN2a disease (e-Fig 6). The proposal of subdivision into pN2a and pN2b disease by the IASLC Lung Cancer Staging Project is considered appropriate. Regarding pN1 disease, NCDB and validation cohort analyses both showed that patients with pN1b disease experienced a signi /uniFB01 cantly shorter OS than those with pN1a disease (Figs 1, 2, e-Fig 6). In the detailed survival analysis in accordance with the number of metastatic lymph nodes in pN1 disease (Fig 3), a difference was found among the multiple pN1 groups, suggesting that the number of metastatic lymph nodes is important. However, the IASLC Lung Cancer Staging Project has not revised the pN1 classi /uniFB01 cation in the ninth edition because clinical staging methods did not permit reliable counting of N1 lymph nodes or stations.\nThis study has several limitations. First, the /uniFB01 ndings were derived from pathologic staging and have not been validated in the clinical setting. 7 It is dif /uniFB01 cult to determine the number of individual metastatic lymph nodes by clinical staging (especially radiologic staging), although the number or location of lymph node metastases is associated with postoperative prognosis in resected Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 14-21 In breast cancer, the nodal staging system uses separate clinical and pathologic nodal\nHazard ratio (HR), hazard ratio; pMulti-N1 ¼ pathologic multiple N1; pMulti-N2 ¼ pathologic multiple N2; pSingle-N1 ¼ pathologic single N1; pSingle-N2 ¼ pathologic single N2; T ¼ tumor.\na Includes all other races.\n]\ncategories. 6 Clinical nodal classi /uniFB01 cation is de /uniFB01 ned by the location of metastatic lymph nodes, whereas pathologic nodal staging is determined by the regions of metastatic lymph nodes and the number of ipsilateral axillary metastatic lymph nodes. 6 However, in lung cancer, the idea of separating the approach to clinical staging from that to pathologic staging expressly was rejected in ninth edition of TNM staging because of complexity and likely confusion. Second, the quality of data for the number of lymph node dissection is subject to the surgeons ' assessment. 22,23 Although the Commission on Cancer recommends that at least one lymph node in N1 station and three lymph nodes in N2 and N3 stations (three distinct stations) should be examined for resected Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a question remains regarding the minimum number of lymph nodes that should be evaluated pathologically. 24 The NCDB may identify fewer or more total lymph nodes if the pathologist did not examine the lymph nodes in the specimen adequately or if the surgeon removed some lymph nodes in a piecemeal fashion during lung cancer resection. 25 These issues should be investigated in further prospective studies with a clearly de /uniFB01 ned protocol. Third, lymph node count was used for this study. This is because the NCDB does not have station-speci /uniFB01 c information, only number of lymph nodes. Asamura et al 13 proposed a framework for\nsingle and multiple lymph node metastases in the eighth edition, but it was not adopted in the ninth edition because of the dif /uniFB01 culty in reliably distinguishing between clinical N1a and N1b involvement. The IASLC Lung Cancer Staging Project examined and dismissed the lymph node count approach and opted for lymph node stations as more reliable and reproducible.",
