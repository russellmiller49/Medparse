Historically, few therapeutic options were available, with mortality > 75% with conservative management alone; therefore, surgery gained a prominent lifesaving role. 2,3 In 1978, Garzon and Gourin 3 published outcomes for a series of patients with massive hemoptysis over a decade\ndemonstrating an improvement in mortality to 17% with early operative intervention.\nOver the last 50 years, advances in medical imaging, /uniFB01 beroptic technology, and interventional radiology have improved patient outcomes and reduced mortality. Whereas historical management was conservative with an emphasis on emergent surgery, bronchial artery embolization (BAE) has emerged as an effective minimally invasive means to control massive hemoptysis. 4,5 The literature reveals an improvement in mortality for massive hemoptysis to 13% to 17.8%. 6-8 Critical to\nABBREVIATIONS: BAE = bronchial artery embolization; ETT = endotracheal tube; TXA = tranexamic acid\nAFFILIATIONS: From the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center, Richmond, VA.\nCORRESPONDENCE TO: Samira Shojaee, MD, MPH, Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Division of Interventional\nPulmonology, Virginia Commonwealth University Health Center, 1200 E Broad St, PO Box 980050, Richmond, VA 23298; e-mail: sshojaee@mcvh-vcu.edu\nCopyright /C211 2019 American College of Chest Physicians.

All rights reserved.\n[\n]\nthe successful management of patients with hemoptysis is a knowledge of the precipitating causes of hemoptysis and the importance of a prompt and coordinated response to synchronize ef /uniFB01 cient care for these patients.\nMassive hemoptysis was previously de /uniFB01 ned as a speci /uniFB01 c volume of expectorated blood within a particular period of time. However, approximating the amount of hemoptysis is challenging, and frequently over- or underestimated. Prior de /uniFB01 nitions for massive hemoptysis ranged quite widely from 200 to 1,000 mL/ 24 h and were an ongoing source of debate. 9,10 Instead, additional clinical factors such as the briskness of bleeding, ability of a patient to maintain a patent airway and expectorate blood, the swiftness of available therapeutic options, and the patient ' s underlying physiological reserve are far more important. These more signi /uniFB01 cant variables underscore the concept of the magnitude of effect de /uniFB01 nition for massive hemoptysis. Within this context, any degree of hemoptysis causing clinical consequences such as respiratory failure from airway obstruction or hypotension is considered lifethreatening hemoptysis. 1 This de /uniFB01 nition relies on the main clinical consequence of hemoptysis -hemoptysis resulting in aspiration of blood to the contralateral lung, airway obstruction, hypoxemia requiring mechanical ventilation, transfusion, and death 1,11,12 One limitation of this de /uniFB01 nition is that it excludes a population with optimal respiratory reserve who can ef /uniFB01 ciently expectorate large volumes of blood, and remain clinically stable during the initial stages of lifethreatening hemoptysis. Such instances should be managed with equal ef /uniFB01 ciency, assuming that clinical instability will follow if management is not expedited.\nAmong cases of fatal hemoptysis, the inciting cause of death is not hemorrhagic shock, but asphyxiation from inability to oxygenate or ventilate because of hemorrhage /uniFB02 ooding the airways. The total volume of the conducting airways averages 150 mL in adults. 13 Therefore, a given hemorrhage that may be regarded as mild from another location can briskly become life threatening in the airways.\nThe existing literature on hemoptysis spans over a century. Most studies are retrospective, single-centered, and include a heterogeneous population of patients, including combinations of different etiologies and different categories of hemoptysis while often including both minor and massive hemoptysis in the same cohort. Selection bias, small sample size, and limited internal and external validity are among the major limitations of\nmost studies in this area. This, in addition to the changing prevalence of hemoptysis in different regions of the world, should be taken into account when reviewing the literature on massive hemoptysis.",

      "content": "Although hemoptysis is a common cause of outpatient pulmonary clinic visits and hospital admissions, massive hemoptysis is relatively uncommon. 11 TB, bronchiectasis, mycetoma, and cancer are the leading etiologies of massive hemoptysis. 11,14 Among regions of the world with a high endemic burden of TB, it is the dominant cause of hemoptysis and remains the most common cause of massive hemoptysis worldwide. 15 Iatrogenic hemoptysis occurring from procedures is reported in 0.26% to 5% of diagnostic bronchoscopies; however, massive hemoptysis complicates only a minute fraction of these procedures. 16 Although 20% of patients with lung cancer are estimated to experience hemoptysis at some point in their clinical course, massive hemoptysis affects only 3% of this population. 17,18 Up to 80% of patients with malignancy-related massive hemoptysis present with episodes of sentinel bleeding during the weeks prior to their event. 19 Table 1 lists etiologies of life-threatening hemoptysis.\nMortality in patients with hemoptysis is higher in several groups. In a study of 1,087 patients with hemoptysis, a mortality risk score was developed based on factors independently associated with increased mortality. 12 One point was assigned for chronic alcoholism, pulmonary artery involvement, or hemorrhage affecting two or more quadrants on chest radiograph, whereas 2 points were assigned for aspergillosis, cancer, or need for mechanical ventilation. The cumulative total score predicted increasing mortality ranging from 1 point (2% mortality) to 7 points (91% mortality). Additionally, baseline medical conditions including reserve pulmonary function and presence of underlying organ failure have a substantial impact on mortality from lifethreatening hemoptysis. 20 Conditions such as aspergilloma, bronchiectasis, and cancer also carry a higher hemoptysis-related mortality because of increased risks of recurrent hemoptysis. 21",

      "title": "Procedural Preparedness and Prevention",
      "content": "Life-threatening hemoptysis may occur either as a new presentation or as an iatrogenic complication during an invasive procedure. Procedural risks of hemoptysis can be decreased by carefully selecting patients for invasive\nprocedures such as bronchoscopic lung biopsies and by performing lung biopsies in dependent lung regions when feasible to facilitate hemostasis without spillage of\nblood into adjacent lung segments. Continuation of lowdose aspirin prior to most bronchoscopic procedures is acceptable and safe. However, we recommend against the use of clopidogrel and warfarin, alone or in combination, prior to transbronchial lung biopsy. In a comparative prospective study of 1,217 patients, Herth et al 22 demonstrated that low-dose aspirin did not increase risk of bleeding during transbronchial lung biopsy. A prospective study by Ernst et al 23 showed signi /uniFB01 cantly higher risk of bleeding in 18 patients on clopidogrel undergoing transbronchial lung biopsies -89% compared with only 3.4% in control subjects. A combination of aspirin with clopidogrel was associated with either moderate or severe hemorrhage in every instance. The study was stopped early because of serious bleeding complications.\nUremia from renal failure is also recognized as a risk factor for coagulopathy because of uremic platelet dysfunction. 24 However, there are limited data on the risks uremia poses speci /uniFB01 cally for procedural hemoptysis. Some recommend desmopressin as an adjunct to mitigate this risk because it has been proven to decrease bleeding time in patients with uremia in small studies. 25,26 Limited data exist on the safe minimum threshold for platelet count when performing endobronchial or transbronchial lung biopsies. 27 Papin et al 28 reported a series of 24 patients with thrombocytopenia (mean platelet count, 30,000/mm 3 /C6 16,500/mm 3 ) undergoing transbronchial lung biopsies wherein 20.8% had bleeding complications. Pulmonary hypertension is also regarded as a relative contraindication for transbronchial biopsies. However, in a retrospective study of 107 patients with pulmonary hypertension suggested by elevated right ventricular systolic pressure on echocardiography, no increased risk of bleeding with transbronchial biopsy or endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration was noted, compared with 83 patients in a control group with nonelevated right ventricular systolic pressure. 29\nTransbronchial cryobiopsy has emerged as an alternative to surgical lung biopsy in the diagnosis of diffuse parenchymal lung disease. 30,31 However, because of the elevated risk of major hemorrhage, expert consensus suggests routine use of a bronchial blocker or Fogarty balloon to isolate procedural bleeding in patients who are intubated. 30 In addition, some protocols recommend performing this procedure with rigid bronchoscopy to allow for immediate control of any signi /uniFB01 cant hemorrhage. 31\nCardiac Congenital heart disease Congestive heart failure\nMitral stenosis",

Table 2 shows a checklist of tools required and important actions necessary to improve emergency preparedness and rapid response to bleeding emergencies.\nMany of the advanced techniques to control hemoptysis require expertise and specialized equipment. 32 Management of massive hemoptysis should be approached in a multidisciplinary fashion. A group of respiratory therapists, interventional radiologists, intensivists, pulmonologists, and surgeons should comprise a hemoptysis response team. Because massive hemoptysis is uncommon and often encountered unexpectedly, we suggest that life-threatening hemoptysis management algorithm simulations and drills be implemented in every institution that cares for patients with massive hemoptysis, and in any procedural unit, where risk of hemoptysis exists.",

The lungs are perfused with twin blood supplies: deoxygenated blood in the pulmonary arteries at lower pulmonary pressures (mean pulmonary artery pressure, 12-16 mm Hg) and oxygenated blood /uniFB02 owing within the bronchial arteries at systemic pressures (mean arterial pressure, 100 mm Hg). 33 Over time, in /uniFB02 ammation, hypoxia, and neoplasia can incite proliferation of bronchial vasculature via secretion of proangiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor and angiopoietin-1. 34 New vessels are usually thin-walled and fragile, are exposed to increased systemic arterial pressures, and are prone to rupture into the airways resulting in hemoptysis. It is estimated that 90% of cases of massive hemoptysis emanate from the bronchial vasculature. 35 Therefore, BAE has emerged as an exceedingly useful minimally invasive tool in the management of hemoptysis. Additional recruitment of nonbronchial collateral vessels can occur from ectopic sites such as adjacent intercostal arteries, inferior phrenic arteries, the thyrocervical trunk, internal mammary arteries, and subclavian arteries among other sites. 36 Multidetector CT scan has been proven to be highly effective in localizing bleeding from normal or ectopic bronchial arteries. 35-37",

      "content": "When a complete history and physical examination is permitted, the clinical time line and coexistent symptoms may provide valuable clues for the origin of hemoptysis. The diagnostic workup should follow immediately after airway and hemodynamic stabilization. The presence of infectious symptoms, recent surgical procedures, administration of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, and history of malignancy, TB, or underlying pulmonary disease could be very revealing as to suspect causes. Additionally, epistaxis and hematemesis should be considered and ruled out as other potential sources of blood.\nDistinguishing the side of culprit bleed is vital in lifethreatening hemoptysis because the decision to lateralize, placing the bleeding side into a dependent position, is one of the most important /uniFB01 rst steps in stabilization. To determine the side of bleeding, chest radiograph is known to have limited sensitivity. 37-39 In a study of 80 patients with large or massive hemoptysis, chest radiograph was able to discern the location of hemorrhage in only 46% of cases and suggested the speci /uniFB01 c cause of bleeding in only 35%. 37 In a separate study of 722 patients with minor and massive hemoptysis, a new diagnosis of malignancy was made in\n144 patients; of these, 35 patients (24%) had normal chest radiograph /uniFB01 ndings. 40\nMultidetector CT scan is superior to chest radiograph in ability to identify both the anatomic origin and underlying cause of hemorrhage and to de /uniFB01 ne the course of both bronchial and nonbronchial collateral arteries. 37,38,41,42 In a retrospective study, CT scan identi /uniFB01 ed the location and cause of bleeding in 70% and 77% of cases, respectively. 37 In a comparative\nretrospective study of 400 patients with hemoptysis, Khalil et al 43 observed that patients who underwent multiple detector CT angiography prior to BAE were more likely to have successful resolution of hemorrhage from embolization and were also less likely to need emergent surgery.\nA prospective study of 606 patients with any degree of hemoptysis found CT scan more likely to diagnose the underlying cause of hemorrhage (77.3% of cases) in\ncomparison with bronchoscopy (48.7% of cases). 14 The combination of both CT scan and bronchoscopy was diagnostic of the etiology of hemorrhage in 83.9% of cases. However, the study population was of a combination of both minor and massive hemoptysis, thereby underestimating the true diagnostic ability for bronchoscopy to lateralize the side of culprit bleeding in cases of massive hemoptysis. The choice of bronchoscopy vs CT scan depends on the equipment availability, institutional practice, and patient population. Although bronchoscopy is invaluable in diagnosis and stabilization, it is not readily available in all institutions and should not delay care to a patient who is clinically stable for transfer to CT scan for ef /uniFB01 cient hemorrhage localization and a speedy transition to de /uniFB01 nitive therapies such as BAE.",

      "content": "Immediate airway control and isolation of the bleeding airway is very important. There are several strategies for isolation of hemorrhage. If the side of bleeding is known, immediate lateralization by moving the patient into the decubitus position with bleeding side down is the /uniFB01 rst step to prevent hemorrhage from /uniFB02 ooding into other regions of lung. 44 For massive hemoptysis, intubation with larger diameter ETTs of $ 8.5 mm inner diameter is recommended when possible to enable passage of therapeutic /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopes with large working channels that allow extraction of obstructing blood clots and placement of bronchial blockers. 45 Several strategies for placement of in /uniFB02 atable bronchial blockers or Fogarty balloons either coaxially through an ETT or in parallel to the tube have been described (Fig 1C). 32,46 In the absence of balloon occlusion, selective intubation into the left- or right-sided mainstem with an ETT can isolate the lung from hemorrhage on the contralateral side. The left-sided mainstem bronchus, given its longer anatomy, is better suited to accommodate an ETT balloon cuff than the shorter right-sided mainstem bronchus, where the right side upper lobe aperture is at high risk of occlusion (Fig 1A). Nasotracheal intubation is discouraged given the inability to perform selective bronchial intubation with the foreshortened length of the ETT and limitations on the ETT size permitted via this method. Flexible bronchoscopy should be used to direct and con /uniFB01 rm placement of bronchial blockers while performing selective intubation. 46\nDual lumen ETTs are designed to isolate each lung and are commonly used in thoracic surgery; however, their\nrole in massive hemoptysis is obsolete because their narrow individual lumens do not permit ef /uniFB01 cient evacuation of clots or use of standard-sized /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopes with working channels large enough to evacuate hemorrhage and blood clots from airways (Fig 1B). 46,47 Immediate transfer to an ICU should be arranged for ongoing monitoring and treatment.",

Historically, both ice cold saline and dilutions of epinephrine have been used. Both therapies are thought to cause local vasoconstriction and have been used widely without rigorous evidence. Conlan and Hurwitz 50 described a series of 12 patients with massive hemoptysis treated with 50 mL aliquots of 4 /C14 C iced saline (300-750 mL per patient) with resolution of hemorrhage. Although Conlan and Hurwitz 50 noted transient sinus bradycardia in a single patient, there was control of hemorrhage in all patients undergoing treatment. No rigorous controlled trial has been performed to evaluate the ef /uniFB01 cacy of iced saline for control of hemorrhage. Use of iced saline has become common practice; however, instilled volumes of iced saline are typically smaller.\nEndobronchial epinephrine and norepinephrine are also commonly used; however, safe dosage and concentration vary quite widely in the literature. 51 In contrast to iced saline, the safety of endobronchial epinephrine has been questioned given reports of coronary vasospasm and arrhythmia. 51,52 If used, lower concentrations of epinephrine 1:100,000 in 2 mL aliquots, not exceeding 0.6 mg, are suggested. 51 Close cardiac monitoring and avoidance in patients with coronary artery disease or arrhythmia is recommended. Additionally, instilled epinephrine is quickly diluted and washed immediately away from bleeding segments by active hemorrhage. For this reason, the utility of endobronchial epinephrine in cases of life-threatening hemoptysis is questionable at best. Despite adhering to fundamental airway management principles and use of conservative measures such as iced saline lavage, most cases require additional therapy for hemostasis. Valipour et al 53 studied 76 patients with massive hemoptysis and found that only 13 cases (17%) had resolution of hemoptysis with such conservative measures alone.\nIn addition to the steps previously mentioned, /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopy offers other bene /uniFB01 ts whether hemorrhage is emanating from larger central airways or smaller inaccessible peripheral airways. In distal airway hemorrhage, the bronchoscope can identify the segmental bleeding airway and then be wedged into the bleeding segment to provide local tamponade until a blood clot is formed. This technique is often used in the\nTABLE 3\n]\n(Continued)\nsetting of procedure-related hemorrhage, such as transbronchial lung biopsies, when the exact site of bleeding is known.\nIn instances where hemorrhage originates from the proximal airways, commonly because of malignant central airway disease, local thermoablative therapies such as electrocautery, argon plasma coagulation, or Nd:YAG laser all have demonstrated utility to provide hemostasis. 54,55 It is noteworthy however that most causes of massive hemoptysis do not occur in the immediately accessible central airways.\nOther techniques of local hemoptysis control using substrates to promote hemostasis or tamponade including oxidized regenerated cellulose, gelatinthrombin, silicone spigots, airway stents, and polymer surgical sealants have been described. 53,56-60 Tranexamic acid (TXA), an anti /uniFB01 brinolytic medication that competitively inhibits plasminogen activation, has been prospectively studied in groups of submassive hemoptysis in both IV and nebulized form. Although patients with massive hemoptysis were not included, TXA was associated with a decrease in hemoptysis and need for interventional procedures. 61,62 Additionally, recombinant activated factor VII has also been used in cases of hemoptysis because of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. 63 Table 3 lists various endobronchial techniques used in the management of massive hemoptysis. However, most available literature on massive hemoptysis is limited for several reasons including the following: small sample sizes, lack of control groups for comparison, inclusion of heterogeneous populations, and simultaneous utilization of several different therapeutic measures.",

      "content": "After successful stabilization of the airway and initial hemostasis, most patients with massive hemoptysis require de /uniFB01 nitive therapy, often in the form of percutaneous BAE. First introduced in 1972, BAE is both minimally invasive and highly effective in controlling hemoptysis. 65 Using a percutaneous approach, an arteriogram reveals the bronchial arteries that typically originate at the level of T5 and T6 from the thoracic aorta; however, collateral bronchial arteries may originate from ectopic sites. Active extravasation is found in only a minority of cases (10%-15%); however, other visible abnormalities such as tortuosity, arteriovenous malformations, aneurysms, dilation, and hypertrophy of bronchial arteries may also suggest a culprit source of bleeding. A variety of embolization agents can be used such as 300 to 600 m m polyvinyl alcohol particles, trisacryl gelatin microspheres, N-butyl cyanoacrylate glue, gelatin sponges, and metallic coils to occlude the bronchial vascular supply. 5,65-67\nIn a systematic review of BAE, Panda et al 67 examined 22 studies totaling 3,265 patients and de /uniFB01 ned the initial success rate of BAE from 70% to 99%. However, the recurrence rate for bleeding is high, estimated up to 58% within 30 days. 68 Interestingly, although the technologies to perform BAE have evolved, the rate of recurrent hemoptysis has remained unchanged. 67 Risk factors for recurrence post-BAE include bleeding from aspergillomas, TB, bronchiectasis, nonbronchial systemic collateral circulation, and bronchopulmonary shunting. 4,67 BAE failure can be caused by recanalization\nof embolized arteries, incomplete embolization of existing arteries, and development of new collateral blood supply. 5,69 Although uncommon, the most feared complication of embolization is spinal cord ischemia because of embolism of anterior spinal arteries, estimated to occur in 1.4% to 6.5% of cases. 35 With improvements in imaging and highly selective embolization techniques, this complication has become less common. 4 Other rare complications include esophageal ischemia or subintimal dissection of the aorta or bronchial arteries.",

      "content": "Although surgery was once regarded as the only available therapy for life-threatening hemoptysis, with improvements in /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopy, CT scan, and interventional radiology, the indications for surgery have evolved. However, massive hemoptysis related to iatrogenic pulmonary artery rupture, complex arteriovenous malformations, or refractory hemoptysis secondary to aspergillomas, large lung abscesses, and chest trauma all remain circumstances where surgery should be considered promptly as the /uniFB01 rst line of therapy. 44,70,71 In other circumstances, surgery remains an emergent contingency if other methods fail. Andrejak et al 72 reviewed outcomes of 111 cases of severe hemoptysis treated with surgery and reported higher hospital mortality among cases performed emergently (34%) compared with scheduled cases after initial control of hemorrhage (4%) or planned after discharge (0%). Given the higher associated risk of surgery, initial intervention with BAE or local bronchoscopic control is preferred. Risk factors of poor outcome with surgery include older age, pneumonectomy, alcoholism, presurgical need for blood transfusion, or vasopressor medications. 72",

      "title": "Conclusions",
      "content": "Response to life-threatening hemoptysis should consist of an initial stabilization phase wherein the airway is secured and the origin of hemoptysis is localized and isolated from adjacent nonbleeding lung, followed by a multidisciplinary approach to guide therapy. Subsequently, treatment should involve BAE,\ntherapeutic bronchoscopy, surgery, or a combination of methods. In selective circumstances, additional adjuncts to control bleeding may be advantageous. However, adherence to a systematic management algorithm focused on the fundamentals of airway management and\npreservation of lung regions from becoming overwhelmed by hemorrhage take precedence. Although minor to moderate hemoptysis is a frequent clinical presentation, massive hemoptysis may occur with little warning and always constitutes an emergency. Therefore, successful management requires careful implementation of simulations, drills, and preparedness practices in a designated response team that includes respiratory therapists, pulmonologists, interventional radiologists, and thoracic surgeons.",
