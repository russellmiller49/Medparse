    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPL) continues to present clinical challenges. Despite extensive experience with guided bronchoscopy, the diagnostic yield has not improved significantly. Robotic-assisted bronchoscopic platforms have been developed potentially to improve the diagnostic yield for PPL. Presently, limited data exist that evaluate the performance of robotic systems in live human subjects. RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the safety and feasibility of robotic-assisted bronchoscopy in patients with PPLs? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a prospective, multicenter pilot and feasibility study that used a robotic bronchoscopic system with a mother-daughter configuration in patients with PPL 1 to 5 cm in size. The primary end points were successful lesion localization with the use of radial probe endobronchial ultrasound (R-EBUS) imaging and incidence of procedure related adverse events. Robotic bronchoscopy was performed in patients with the use of direct visualization, electromagnetic navigation, and fluoroscopy. After the use of R-EBUS imaging, transbronchial needle aspiration was performed. Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) was used on all cases. Transbronchial needle aspiration alone was sufficient when ROSE was diagnostic; when ROSE was not diagnostic, transbronchial biopsy was performed with the use of the robotic platform, followed by conventional guided bronchoscopic approaches at the discretion of the investigator. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients were enrolled at five centers. One patient withdrew consent, which left 54 patients for data analysis. Median lesion size was 23 mm (interquartile range, 15 to 29 mm). R-EBUS images were available in 53 of 54 cases. Lesion localization was successful in 51 of 53 patients (96.2%). Pneumothorax was reported in two of 54 of the cases (3.7%); tube thoracostomy was required in one of the cases (1.9 %). No additional adverse events occurred. INTERPRETATION: This is the first, prospective, multicenter study of robotic bronchoscopy in patients with PPLs. Successful lesion localization was achieved in 96.2% of cases, with an adverse event rate comparable with conventional bronchoscopic procedures. Additional large prospective studies are warranted to evaluate procedure characteristics, such as diagnostic yield.

Although the majority of these nodules may simply require surveillance imaging, many will require biopsy.\nDespite technologic advancements in guided bronchoscopy such as electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy, ultrathin bronchoscopy, and radial probe endobronchial ultrasound (R-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)) imaging, the diagnostic yield of bronchoscopic approaches for peripheral nodules has been inconsistent in randomized controlled studies, ranging from 40% to 60%. 2-4\nPotential limitations to current approaches include challenges that advance the bronchoscope into peripheral airways due to size limitations of the scope as subsegmental bronchi become progressively smaller as they extend peripherally. In addition, subsegmental bronchi often branch at varying angles, which may be dif /uniFB01 cult to negotiate with the use of conventional bronchoscopes. These factors may limit operators ' ability to advance the bronchoscope into close proximity to peripheral pulmonary lesions when attempting biopsy and may negatively affect the diagnostic yield of the procedure.\nRobotic surgery has been performed across many platforms that include urologic, gynecologic, and thoracic surgery and offers potential advantages of improved dexterity and visualization while maintaining minimally invasive approaches. 5 Early preclinical experience with a robotic endoscopic system within human cadaveric lungs demonstrated increased reach into the lung periphery with the robotic platform compared with a similarly sized bronchoscope in both tortuous and relatively straightforward segmental bronchi. 6 Additional preclinical studies demonstrated high accuracy with the use of the robotic system to perform transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) of simulated tumor targets sized 1 to 3 cm in cadaveric lungs and the ability to place biopsy instruments within targeted lesions in cadaver models with a greater degree of accuracy compared with conventional guided approaches. 7,8 Presently, very few data exist regarding the use of a robotic endoscopic system in live human subjects with peripheral lesions in need of biopsy. 9,10\nThis study was performed to assess the feasibility of performing robotic bronchoscopy to locate peripheral lesions in patients and to evaluate the safety and performance characteristics of procedures in a multicenter, prospective trial.",

Following this, the robotic bronchoscopic system (Monarch; Auris Health) was connected to the existing endotracheal tube. The robotic bronchoscopic system is composed of a tower with monitor and a unit that houses arms that control insertion, retraction, and articulation of an outer sheath (6.0 mm outer diameter) and inner scope (4.4 mm outer diameter) that has a 2.1-mm working channel. With the use of a hand-held controller, the sheath and scope may be driven independently or simultaneously as a unit (Fig 1). Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy is incorporated into the system to provide navigational support with a CT scan that was obtained within 2 weeks of the procedure (Fig 2).\nWith the robotic system in place, the sheath and scope were driven simultaneously to the targeted lobe where the outer sheath was left in position. Subsequently, the inner scope was advanced distally into the lobar and segmental bronchi with a combination of direct visualization, electromagnetic navigation, and /uniFB02 uoroscopic guidance towards the targeted lesion.",

      "title": "Discussion",
      "content": "The American College of Chest Physicians clinical practice guidelines currently recommend guided bronchoscopy for the diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary lesions when lung cancer is suspected. 11 Despite experience with a myriad of bronchoscopic approaches over the past 10 years, the diagnosis of peripheral nodules continues to present a signi /uniFB01 cant challenge to clinicians. Although earlier data reported diagnostic yields of approximately 70% for guided bronchoscopic approaches, more recent results from randomized controlled trials with clearly de /uniFB01 ned end points have been inconsistent, which suggests that the diagnostic yield may be closer to 40% to 60% and is even lower when peripheral nodules are adjacent to the bronchus. 2-4,12,13\nThis represents the /uniFB01 rst prospective, multicenter trial of robotic bronchoscopy in patients with peripheral pulmonary lesions. Robotic bronchoscopic approaches remain in early phases of exploration, and this study contributes to understanding the technology in the following ways. First, the primary effectiveness end point was designed to assess the ability to navigate successfully to peripheral lesions, con /uniFB01 rmed in real-time with the use of R-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) imaging. The ability to use the robotic system to locate and con /uniFB01 rm lesion localization in 96.2% of patients suggests that the current system successfully positions bronchoscopists within close proximity to targeted lesions, which is a critical step prior to performing biopsies. Second, the observed adverse event rate of procedures was low, even among novice operators\nwho previously had not used the new technology outside of cadaver models. 6,7 This may be of signi /uniFB01 cance in that, unlike conventional bronchoscopy, robotic systems do not provide the operator with haptic feedback. Although prior cadaver studies had assessed the ability to navigate peripheral airways, safety data could not be evaluated readily. In this study, there was no evidence of airway trauma during robotic bronchoscopy, and the pneumothorax rate was similar to what has been reported when current guided bronchoscopic techniques were used. 14 Also, despite additional steps required to prepare the robotic system, procedure times were comparable with early experiences with the use of navigational systems. 15 Third, despite the limitations of evaluating ef /uniFB01 cacy in a pilot study, we feel that the diagnostic yield of 74% achieved in this study with new technology compares favorably with recent publications of established technologies that have largely shown lower diagnostic yields when similarly strict de /uniFB01 nitions were applied in randomized controlled studies. Although Oki et al 16 reported a diagnostic yield of 70% using ultrathin bronchoscopy, virtual bronchoscopic navigation, and radial ultrasound imaging for pulmonary nodules, a prospective, randomized controlled trial that compared thin bronchoscopy with R-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) to conventional transbronchial biopsy with /uniFB02 uoroscopy demonstrated a diagnostic yield of 49% for guided bronchoscopy, which was not statistically different from the yield of conventional bronchoscopy. 2 An additional large prospective observational study that used similar de /uniFB01 nitions reported a diagnostic yield of 57% among patients who were undergoing various guided bronchoscopic techniques. 17 Although there are signi /uniFB01 cant limitations in comparing this study with randomized controlled trials, the reported yield in this study is encouraging for new technology and will require further exploration through larger investigations.\nAn additional observation was that the performance characteristics of robotic bronchoscopy did not appear to be affected by lesion orientation relative to the bronchus. The diagnostic yield of 70% for eccentric lesions is encouraging because this compares favorably to the yields of 30% to 40% reported in the literature in this patient population. 18 Improvement in diagnostic yield for eccentric lesions has clinical signi /uniFB01 cance, because eccentric lesions were documented in nearly 40% of patients in this study and in as many as 50% of patients in prior publications. 19\nThe limitations of this study would be related primarily to the relatively small sample size. As a pilot and feasibility study, the speci /uniFB01 c aims were to investigate the feasibility of the use of the robotic system in humans safely and the ability to navigate the robotic endoscope to the targeted lesion. This study was designed with the use of the hypothesis that a diagnostic biopsy is a composite of successful navigation to the targeted lesion followed by successful biopsy of the targeted lesion. Without successful navigation and lesion localization, it would seem less likely that diagnostic biopsy specimens would be obtained. An additional limitation of this study would be the proposed clinical signi /uniFB01 cance of successful lesion localization as it relates to impact on diagnostic yield. In this study, lesion localization was 96.2%, and the diagnostic yield was 74%; additional studies will investigate whether factors such as increased user experience, biopsy tools, or other factors may in /uniFB02 uence\nValues represent median (interquartile range).\na Radial endobronchial ultrasound probe unavailable for one case.\n]\nthe discordance between lesion localization and diagnostic yield. Last, recent data suggest that falsepositive R-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) images may be produced by focal atelectasis during bronchoscopy procedures and that the likelihood of atelectasis may increase with procedure duration. 20 Although this is an emerging area of interest, we maintain that R-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) imaging characteristics such as well-de /uniFB01 ned borders surrounding the targeted lesion and a R-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) imaging lesion diameter that corresponds with measurements by chest CT scanning minimizes the\nrisk of false-positive image characterization.\nAdditionally, robotic bronchoscopy was performed routinely prior to convex Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) staging of the mediastinum to further minimize the likelihood of the development of intraprocedural atelectasis.\nSome strengths of this study that may improve generalizability of results include the multicentered nature of the study and prospectively designed protocol towards performing procedures that allowed us to evaluate speci /uniFB01 c aspects of robotic technology at multiple sites using a standardized approach. Also, although diagnostic yield was not a primary end point, we feel that the methods used to de /uniFB01 ne diagnostic\nspecimens are an additional strength of the study and may be helpful with future investigations that are powered and designed to assess diagnostic yield and sensitivity of robotic platforms. Diagnostic criteria were designed to protect against any potential ambiguity or operator bias and required cytopathologic evidence that the targeted lesion had been biopsied successfully. In cases of malignancy, this was reported as a speci /uniFB01 c diagnosis of cancer. Specimens labeled ' atypical ' were considered not diagnostic. Nonmalignant cases required either a speci /uniFB01 c diagnosis such as ' granuloma ' or cytopathologic evidence of a process such as ' in /uniFB02 ammation ' that demonstrated documented radiographic improvement within the 1-year follow up. Cases that demonstrated normal pulmonary elements on cytopathology with radiographic improvement on follow-up imaging were considered not diagnostic because there was no evidence that the targeted lesion had been sampled adequately.\nIn conclusion, the results of this study demonstrate the feasibility and safety of performing robotic bronchoscopy in patients with peripheral pulmonary lesions with the use of a prospectively designed, multicenter approach, with strict de /uniFB01 nitions of diagnostic and nondiagnostic biopsy specimens. Con /uniFB01 rmation of lesion localization occurred in 96% of patients, with an observed adverse event rate comparable with conventional bronchoscopy. We believe that demonstrating safety and the ability to locate peripheral lesions is an integral /uniFB01 rst step in the evolution of this technology. Because of variability in the reported diagnostic yield of current guided bronchoscopic approaches, we propose that, to perform an appropriate assessment of robotic technology, additional studies that will address diagnostic yield and factors that in /uniFB02 uence this be performed in signi /uniFB01 cantly larger, prospective comparative effectiveness trials with clearly de /uniFB01 ned end points.\na Values based on 54 total patients.\nb Two euroendocrine tumors; one lymphoma.\nc Based on pathology data, concomitant culture data, and resolution on follow-up imaging.",
