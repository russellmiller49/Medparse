    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is a disease characterized by abnormal accumulation of surfactant in the alveoli. Most cases are autoimmune and are associated with an autoantibody against granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) that prevents clearing of pulmonary surfactant by alveolar macrophages. An open-label, phase 2 study showed some therapeutic efficacy of inhaled recombinant human GM-CSF in patients with severe pulmonary alveolar proteinosis; however, the efficacy in patients with mild-to-moderate disease remains unclear.\nMETHODS We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of daily inhaled recombinant human GM-CSF (sargramostim), at a dose of 125 μg twice daily for 7 days, every other week for 24 weeks, or placebo in 64 patients with autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis who had a partial pressure of arterial oxygen (Pao2) while breathing ambient air of less than 70 mm Hg (or <75 mm Hg in symptomatic patients). Patients with severe pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (Pao2 <50 mm Hg) were excluded to avoid possible exacerbation of the disease in patients who were assigned to receive placebo. The primary end point was the change in the alveolar–arterial oxygen gradient between baseline and week 25.\nRESULTS The change in the mean (±SD) alveolar–arterial oxygen gradient was significantly better in the GM-CSF group (33 patients) than in the placebo group (30 patients) (mean change from baseline, −4.50±9.03 mm Hg vs. 0.17±10.50 mm Hg; P = 0.02). The change between baseline and week 25 in the density of the lung field on computed tomography was also better in the GM-CSF group (between-group difference, −36.08 Hounsfield units; 95% confidence interval, −61.58 to −6.99, calculated with the use of the Mann–Whitney U test and the Hodges–Lehmann estimate of confidence intervals for pseudo-medians). Serious adverse events developed in 6 patients in the GM-CSF group and in 3 patients in the placebo group.\nCONCLUSIONS In this randomized, controlled trial, inhaled recombinant human GM-CSF was associated with a modest salutary effect on the laboratory outcome of arterial oxygen tension, and no clinical benefits were noted.

      "content": "P ulmonary alveolar proteinosis, an uncommon lung disease characterized by the accumulation of pulmonary surfactant within pulmonary alveoli, causes progressive respiratory insufficiency. 1,2 Approximately 90% of cases of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis are autoimmune; autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is associated with a high level of autoantibodies against granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). 3 These autoantibodies, which neutralize  the  biologic  activity  of  GM-CSF, 4 impair  the clearance of surfactant and lead to the disease. 5-10\nPulmonary alveolar proteinosis is commonly treated with whole-lung lavage 11 while the patient is under general anesthesia. In this procedure, each lung is infused with up to 50 liters of saline to  physically  remove  the  surfactant  sediment. Although this treatment improves lung function in most patients, 12  repeated treatments are usually  required  because  of  the  reaccumulation  of surfactant. 13   Some improvement in pulmonary function has been observed in trials of subcutaneous  recombinant  human  GM-CSF  involving patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. 14-16\nIn one study involving GM-CSF knockout mice, inhalation (but not extrapulmonary delivery) of GM-CSF corrected pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. 17 By analogy, inhalation of aerosolized exogenous GM-CSF could benefit patients with autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. Pilot studies and a prospective multicenter, open-label, phase 2 study of inhaled GM-CSF therapy showed improvements in gas exchange, especially in patients with severe pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, with no serious treatment-related side effects. 18-21 However, these results may be affected by spontaneous remission, which occurs in approximately 20% of patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. 13  Moreover, the efficacy of inhaled GM-CSF in patients with mild-to-moderate disease remains unknown. We conducted the Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis  GM-CSF  Inhalation  Efficacy  (PAGE) trial, a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial, to test the hypothesis that inhaled GM-CSF would improve oxygenation, findings on lung imaging, and levels of serum markers in patients with mildto-moderate pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.",

For the primary analysis, we determined that a sample size of 30 patients in each  group  (for  a  total  of  60  patients)  would provide the trial with a power of 80% to detect an effect size of 1.31 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76 to 1.81) at the 5% significance level in the change from baseline to week 25 in the alveolar-arterial  oxygen  gradient  between  the GM-CSF group and the placebo group. This calculation  was  based  on  Cohen's  d  formula  (the difference of means divided by the pooled standard deviation).\nNumerical  results  are  presented  as  means (±SD)  or  medians  with  interquartile  ranges. Analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat  principle.  The  Mann-Whitney  U test was used to assess the difference between the two groups, and the sign test was used to assess the differences from baseline to week 25 within each group. A linear mixed-effects model and  a  generalized  linear  model  were  used  to evaluate differences between and within groups. The model included the time elapsed since enrollment, treatment assignment, and interaction between time and treatment. The model procedure  using  statistics  with  the  Kenward-Roger\nadjustment  method  was  used  to  fit  the  model without imputation of missing data. For categorical end points, the data were compared with the use of either the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test. For continuous variables, the medians were compared with a Mann-Whitney U test. The P value  was  two-sided  and  used  for  the  primary end point only. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance.\nWe  used  the  linear  mixed-effects  model  to evaluate the interaction of treatment with smoking  history,  with  the  alveolar-arterial  oxygen gradient  as  the  dependent  variable.  The  model included the time elapsed since enrollment (in months), the treatment assignment (GM-CSF or placebo), smoking history (in persons who had never  smoked  vs.  current  smokers  or  former smokers), and the interaction among time, treatment,  and  smoking  history.

There was no substantial difference  in  the  change  in  walking  distance between baseline and week 25 in the GM-CSF group and the placebo group (19.19±71.80 m vs. 5.63±178.57 m, for a pseudo-median betweengroup difference of 1.52 m [95% CI, -42.00 to 50.00]) (Table 2).",

      "content": "In  this  randomized,  controlled  trial  involving patients with mild-to-moderate autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, the change in the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient was better with inhaled GM-CSF than with placebo. The effect of spontaneous remission, which occurs in approximately 20% of patients, and the placebo effect may have played a role in the earlier openlabel phase 2 study. The effects of spontaneous remission on the reduction in symptoms of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis were obviated by the present randomized trial design.\nEffects  were  observed  on  laboratory  rather than clinical measures. This outcome may be a result of the exclusion of patients with the most severe cases to prevent exacerbation of the condition if they received placebo for 24 weeks. In the previous phase 2 study, 21 patients with severe autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis had a response to inhaled GM-CSF, and the exclusion of these patients from this trial may explain the rather  modest  effects  on  the  alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient in the GM-CSF group and the modest between-group difference in symptoms as measured by the score on the Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) assessment test or 6-minute walk test. Since the primary and secondary end-point measures in the GM-CSF group  changed  together  in  parallel  (although some changes were small), the data across multiple  end-point  measures  indicated,  at  best,  a modest therapeutic benefit.\nThe  difference  between  current  or  former smokers  and  patients  who  had  never  smoked with respect to the increase in the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient suggests that cigarette smoking\nmay affect the pathway of antibody production and thus stimulate GM-CSF neutralization. We speculate that long-term cigarette smoking may cause  minimal  remodeling  of  small  airways, leading  to  changes  in  mucus  production  that affect the distribution of inhaled GM-CSF in the lung. In addition, alveolar macrophages in smokers  may  be  functionally  impaired  beyond  the defects caused by GM-CSF autoantibodies; this impairment  may  be  responsible  for  the  poor response to inhaled GM-CSF in smokers with autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.\nDuring the trial, we observed an increase in serum levels of autoantibodies against GM-CSF in  the  GM-CSF  group  but  not  in  the  placebo group. However, the neutralizing capacity did not differ between the groups, probably because of the duration of inhalation. Administration of subcutaneous, long-term, intermittent recombinant human GM-CSF can cause a transient induction of autoantibodies against GM-CSF in patients with metastatic colon cancer 26  and, in some patients, the antibody can be neutralizing. 27 Infusion of yeast-derived GM-CSF has also induced GM-CSF-reactive autoantibodies in patients with cancer. 28 Because of the lack of a placebo group, the previous phase 2 study could not show an increase in levels of autoantibodies against GM-CSF in patients who received GM-CSF; this finding may have been associated with the production of autoantibodies against the extrinsic, inhaled GM-CSF.\nThis trial has some limitations. First, only one dose of GM-CSF was tested. The effect of higher doses is not known but could be a basis for fur-\nther research. Second, only one type of nebulizer was used for inhalation therapy. Although jet  nebulizers  are  inexpensive  and  commonly used, nebulizers with newer vibrating mesh or membrane components, which are more efficient and facilitate shorter treatment times, could be evaluated.  Third,  the  lyophilized  formulation of recombinant human GM-CSF that was used in this trial required patients to dissolve the agent in saline before inhalation. Face-to-face instruction and a brochure and video instructions for home reference are needed. It is possible that a liquid formulation of GM-CSF would make administration simpler.\nThe results of our randomized, controlled trial showed that inhaled GM-CSF had a significant but very modest effect on the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient in patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. At the dose used, there were changes in some laboratory measures, but no clinically important changes in outcomes were noted.\nA data sharing statement provided by the authors is available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\nSupported by grants from the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (17ek0109079h and 17930161) and the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare of Japan (H24-RinkensuiIppan-003).\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.\nWe thank the investigators and patients who participated in this trial; Takeru Shiroiwa, Ph.D., for support and confirmation of the treatment assignments; the Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis Patients Association of Japan and the Japanese Respiratory Society for public relations activities; Steven M.
