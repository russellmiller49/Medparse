Evidence (largely small or indirect) suggests endoscopy during pregnancy is feasible when clinically indicated, but attention to hypoxemia, hypercapnia, aspiration risk, and drug safety is essential; the review stresses continuous monitoring (e.g., pulse oximetry), minimization of sedatives, left-lateral positioning in late gestation, and individualized risk–benefit decisions (including limited use of fluoroscopy).

Bahhady, MD; and Armin Ernst, MD, FCCP\n(CHEST 2004; 126:1974-1981)\nKey words: bronchoscopy; complications; pregnancy\nAbbreviations: FB = flexible bronchoscopy; FDA = Food and Drug Administration\nG enerally, medical procedures such as flexible bronchoscopy (FB) are avoided in pregnancy as a result of procedure- and sedation-related risks to the mother and the fetus. However, there are situations in which these procedures might be diagnostically or therapeutically indicated and should not be delayed.\nThe current published knowledge about FB in pregnancy is limited to a few case reports 1-8 and one review article 9 ; however, upper and lower GI endoscopy during pregnancy is well described, and the lessons learned may be partially extrapolated to FB.\nThe published studies on endoscopy during pregnancy are mostly retrospective and small. 10 The only exception is a large, case-control study 11 comparing 83 pregnant women undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy with matched pregnant (not undergoing the procedure) and nonpregnant (undergoing the same procedure) women as control subjects. The study reported no increase in adverse events among the pregnant treatment group. However, statistical power was insufficient to exclude a small, but clinically important, fetal risk from endoscopy.\nBronchoscopy during pregnancy has its own spe-\ncific risks from inserting instruments into the airway, such as impaired gas exchange, severe violent cough, and barotrauma (pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum), which may actually be more hazardous to the pregnant patient. Medications used during endoscopy, and thus bronchoscopy, seem to be responsible for many of the endoscopic risks during pregnancy, but their risks are imprecisely defined, apart from the direct effect of each drug on the fetus.\nIn this review, we describe the major issues of performing FB in pregnant women, such as changes in the respiratory system, the potential risks associated with FB, the major indications for FB, the use of diagnostic radiation, and the monitoring of the mother and the fetus during FB. Finally, we list some general recommendations for performing bronchoscopy in pregnant patients.",

The bronchoscopist should understand the implications of these changes when planning, preparing, and monitoring the procedure in pregnant women.\nFunctional Respiratory Changes in Pregnancy\nLarge airway function does not seem to change during pregnancy. 12 The respiratory centers in the brain do appear to change homeostatic set points during pregnancy, as manifested by increased respiratory drive, which is probably a function of increasing levels of progesterone. 13 The mechanism of this change is thought to involve an increasing sensitivity of the medulla to carbon dioxide, such that increases in Pa co 2 elicit an exaggerated respiratory effort, although a direct effect of progesterone on the respiratory center cannot be excluded. 14\nResidual volume and expiratory reserve volume",

The decrease in functional residual capacity is caused by diaphragmatic elevation (caused by increased intraabdominal pressure) and possibly by increased pulmonary blood flow. These changes likely result in increased uptake and elimination of inhalational anesthetics and with rapid oxygen desaturation during hypoventilation episodes, and this in turn makes endotracheal intubation at term more hazardous 16\nRelative hyperventilation begins in the first trimester of pregnancy, with the minute ventilation rising by almost 50% at term. 17 The increase in minute ventilation is primarily the result of a large (up to 40%) increase in tidal volume; the respiratory rate does not change. 18 Pregnant women with normal respiratory rates often complain of dyspnea, which is usually the result of these respiratory adaptations. 19\nOxygen consumption increases by almost 20% during pregnancy, to meet the increased metabolic demands of the placenta, fetus, and maternal organs. However, as mentioned above, minute ventilation rises disproportionately, leading to a rise in alveolar and arterial oxygen levels (normal Pa o 2 in pregnant women ranges from 100 to 110 mm Hg). 20 In addition, Pa co 2 decrease from the nonpregnant average of 40 mm Hg to a plateau of 27 to 32 mm Hg during pregnancy. 13 This respiratory alkalosis is followed by compensatory renal excretion of bicarbonate so that the resultant arterial pH is normal to slightly alkalotic (usually a pH between 7.40 and 7.45). 21 The decrease in Pa co 2 probably helps the fetus to eliminate carbon dioxide across the placenta.",

In the first trimester, the subcostal angle can change from 68° to as much as 103°. 25 The diaphragm rises by up to 4 cm, and the chest diameter can increase ≥ 2 cm. 26 Diaphragmatic excursion is not limited by the uterus, and actually increases by up to 2 cm. 27 The result of these changes is a more 'barrel-chested' appearance during pregnancy.",

A sedated patient may not be able to respond to early warning signs appropriately. Therefore, procedures such as FB should be done with the patient in the left lateral tilt position, which is achieved by placing a wedge under the right side, having the patient lie on her left side, or adjusting the operating table to a 30° left lateral tilt 32",

In an animal study, 43 the fetal heart rate response to either hypoxemia or hypercapnia consisted of slowing and increased variability. Slowing was more consistent with hypercapnia than with hypoxemia.\nCognitive skills were lower in 26 preterm-birth preschool and early school-age children with a slightto-moderate risk for perinatal hypoxia when compared with matched control subjects; however this study 44 was retrospective and the patients had marked hypoxemia in addition to hypercapnia, and its applicability is therefore limited. Other evidence\nof mild and temporary respiratory acidosis effects on human fetal growth and development is lacking; however, until such evidence is obtained, hypoventilation should be avoided during procedures in pregnant women.\nEnd-tidal Pa co 2 (capnometry) is a more sensitive measure of the hypoventilation that is being masked by supplemental oxygen delivery than is direct visual monitoring. 45 A controlled trial 46 evaluating this approach in 195 patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography found that hypercapnia was not reliably detected by clinical observations or by pulse oximetry in patients receiving supplemental oxygen. The addition of transcutaneous carbon dioxide monitoring prevented severe hypercapnia more effectively than intensive clinical monitoring and pulse oximetry alone. Routine capnometry, however, is not currently widely available or included in current recommendations for monitoring patients undergoing conscious sedation. 46",

      "title": "Radiation Exposure During Pregnancy",
      "content": "The potential harmful consequences of radiation for the fetus can be classified into four categories: intrauterine death, malformations, growth and developmental disturbances, and mutagenic and carcinogenic effects. 48 The danger to the fetus from radiation during fluoroscopic procedures depends on the dose of radiation (which in turn is related to exposure time, the number of films obtained, beam size, and imaging area) and gestational age. The preimplanted embryo is most at risk from the lethal effects of radiation. 49\nThe risk is greatly diminished by appropriate and complete abdominal lead shielding, a short radiation exposure time, and performance of the procedure after the 14th week of gestation, when organogenesis has already been achieved. A study 50 of radiation in pregnant women with appropriate abdominal shielding reported no abnormalities related to radiation.\nThe exact dose of radiation received during fluoroscopic FB is not known; however, a study 49 of cardiac catheterization and valvuloplasty reported no adverse fetal effects of ionizing radiation at doses of < 5 rad. The margin of safety is augmented by the fact that most exposures to diagnostic imaging radiation are spread over a period of time; this type of exposure is less harmful than acute exposure. 51 The same risk-benefit analysis should be applied when deciding to use fluoroscopy for diagnostic FB, keeping in mind that fluoroscopy does not improve the yield for transbronchial biopsy, especially in diffuse lung diseases. 52",

Consider an obstetric consultation to help identify and manage at-risk pregnancies.\n7. For conscious sedation, use the lowest effective dose of the drug. Do not use US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) category X or category D drugs (Tables 1, 2).\n8. Avoid using optional drugs. When alternative drugs are available, use the drug that is safest for the fetus.\n9. Perform continuous cardiac monitoring, pulse oximetry, and intermittent sphygmomanometry during the procedure.\n10. Capnography has not been studied in pregnant women during procedures that require conscious sedation and therefore is not recommended.\n11. Monitor the fetus if possible.\n12.
