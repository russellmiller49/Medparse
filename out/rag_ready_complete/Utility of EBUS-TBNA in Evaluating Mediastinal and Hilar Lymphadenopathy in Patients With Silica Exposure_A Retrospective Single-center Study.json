Workers in the coal and metal mining industries are at high risk of inhaling RCS. 1,2 The introduction of silica into modern industries, such as jewelry polishing, stone carving, dental prosthesis, and granite countertop manufacturing, can result in silicosis. 3,4 Silicosis is usually a clinical diagnosis based on a history of suf /uniFB01 cient RCS exposure and compatible imaging features when other etiologies are less likely. 5,6 Lung biopsy is appropriate when clinical data is insuf /uniFB01 cient for a con /uniFB01 dent diagnosis. In silica-exposed individuals, chest computed tomography (CT) can reveal mediastinal and/or hilar lymphadenopathy (MHL) in isolation or in combination with parenchymal involvement. Lymph node (LN) silicosis can precede parenchymal involvement according to previous studies. 7 -9 Biopsy-proven LN silicosis can con /uniFB01 rm silicosis in patients with suf /uniFB01 cient RCS exposure and nodular-interstitial lung involvement on CT. 10\nOver the past 20 years, endobronchial ultrasoundguided transbronchial needle aspiration (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA) of LN has been proven effective in the diagnostic workup of unexplained MHL due to benign etiologies, such as sarcoidosis. 11,12 The presence of birefringent particles reliably predicted occupational dust exposure history in patients with MHL in an Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA cytology study. 13 The use of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA in diagnosing silicosis has been previously reported, 14,15 and explored in 1 retrospective\nDOI: 10.1097/LBR.0000000000001016\nReceived for publication January 8, 2025; accepted April 3, 2025.\nFrom the *Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Marshall University School of Medicine, Huntington, WV; † Respiratory Institute, Lerner College of Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH; ‡ Department of Pathology, Huntington, Marshall University School of Medicine Huntington, WV; and §Diagnostic Radiology in Association with Marshall University School of Medicine, Huntington, WV.\nThe approval included the Waiver of informed consent and the HIPAA Waiver.

      "content": "found in a small retrospective study (N = 11) of workers cutting high-silica content arti /uniFB01 cial stones and having MHL with parenchymal involvement that Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was 100% diagnostic for silicosis based mainly on the identi/uniFB01 cation of BSP in LN aspirates. In contrast to Shitrit and colleagues ' study, our population was relatively larger (N = 84), and predominantly coal miners with exposure to both coal and silica dusts. SNs were identi /uniFB01 ed in 30% of our cohort. For the /uniFB01 rst time, this study proves the feasibility of identifying SNs in Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA specimens, as shown in Figure 1, not only in larger biopsies obtained using mediastinoscopy or surgical lung biopsies.\nThe cytologic criteria in our study to de /uniFB01 ne silicosis in LN relied on limited data, 14 -16 and required that the clinical-radiologic context be considered when interpreting Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA /uniFB01 ndings. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA silicosis-related cytologic criteria relied on the presence of BSP under PLM to be considered diagnostic for silicosis, in the absence of malignancy or another speci /uniFB01 c benign LN disease to explain LN enlargement. Current pathology literature requires the presence of both SN and BSP for histopathologic diagnosis of LN silicosis. 8,9,19 SNs are the histopathologic hallmarks of chronic silicosis in both lung parenchyma and LNs; however, SNs are not always present. 4 Earliest histologic changes in silicosis are characterized by stellate aggregates of loose reticulin /uniFB01 bers and dust-laden macrophages, which eventually form SNs. 20 Recent data showed a dose-response relationship between a cumulative RCS of more than 25 to 30 years and the detection of SNs in mediastinal LNs, indicating that the absence of SNs does not preclude silica exposure or undetected silicosis. 21 Therefore, we did not consider SNs mandatory cytologic evidence of silicosis. However, their presence increases the diagnostic con /uniFB01 dence\nfor silicosis. Therefore, the identi /uniFB01 cation of SNs and other cytology /uniFB01 ndings informed a diagnostic con /uniFB01 dence classi/uniFB01 cation for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA results: de /uniFB01 nitive, probable, or possible silicosis.\nIn patients with known chronic silicosis who received bronchoscopy to exclude malignancy, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA found 1 malignancy, a case of chronic lymphocytic leukemia thought to explain LN enlargement. Similarly, in patients with suspected silicosis based on atypical imaging for whom Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was utilized to con /uniFB01 rm silicosis or to evaluate for other pathology, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA did not provide an alternative diagnosis to silicosis. Thus, in the setting of wellde /uniFB01 ned RCS exposure, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA does not alter the preprocedural presumed silicosis diagnosis. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA is effective for the diagnosis and con /uniFB01 rmation of silicosis. However, it should be reserved for cases of diagnostic uncertainty, such as when exposure history is cryptic or alternative diagnoses are highly suspected.\nIncreased LN/parenchymal lesion PET avidity in /uniFB02 uenced biopsy decisions in 55 cases (65.47%) in our cohort. Interestingly, in the 82 cases (97.61%) for which EBUSTBNA yielded adequate samples, no malignancy or infections were identi /uniFB01 ed. This supports data that showed FDG-PET/CT offers limited utility in diagnosing malignancy in coal worker pneumoconiosis and chronic silicosis due to the high false positive rate. 22,23 When FDG-PET avidity is used to discriminate progressive massive /uniFB01 brosis from lung cancer, using an SUVmax cut-off of 7.4 in combination with other CT parameters (short-axis/long-axis diameters, Houns /uniFB01 eld units of lung masses on PET/CT) can improve diagnostic performance. 24 Our study showed that enlarged LNs in silicosis may remain metabolically active (mean SUVmax of 7.31 g/mL) for many years after the\nexposure (mean time since last exposure was 16.7 y). Therefore, for patients with suspected silicosis, the diagnostic workup should warrant Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA based on clinical and imaging /uniFB01 ndings and not mainly increased PET avidity.",

      "content": "While beryllium and talc (hydrated magnesium silicates) are well-recognized causes of pulmonary granuloma, 25 exposure to RCS is not. However, recent multiple case reports note patients with RCS exposure and biopsy-proven silicosis who also had sarcoid-like granulomas containing BSP under PLM. 14,26,27 Multiple epidemiological studies showed a strong association between RCS exposure and increased risk of sarcoidosis, indicating that silica exposure might be a trigger for sarcoidosis. 28 -36 However, causality is not yet proven. In this study, granulomas appeared in the cytology specimens of 25% (21/84) of patients with known/suspected silicosis, the highest rate yet reported in the literature. This suggests that PLM should be performed whenever granulomas are identi /uniFB01 ed, especially if well-recognized causes of granuloma are not highly suspected or when occupational exposures are cryptic. The diagnostic criteria for sarcoidosis adopted by the American Thoracic Society in 2020, 37 require the exclusion of alternative causes of granuloma, such as metal (inorganic) dust exposure and pneumoconiosis. The presence of granuloma can confound a diagnosis of silicosis because silicosis and sarcoidosis share a number of radiologic features, which can be a diagnostic challenge if exposure history is unclear. In our cohort, chronic beryllium\ndisease is unlikely but cannot be completely excluded. Granulomatous (tuberculosis/fungal) infections are less likely because available stains and cultures were negative.\nThis retrospective study has several strengths. All pivotal data, including occupational exposures and chest CT/cytology /uniFB01 ndings, were uniformly re-examined, reanalyzed, and collected at the time of the study review from a relatively large sample, which generated useful clinical evidence. The study generated (imaging/clinical/ follow-up) data, which showed the impact of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA on clinical care. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA can guide workplace-related secondary preventive strategies by identifying early stages of silicosis (LN-only silicosis without parenchymal involvement). LN-only silicosis can precede parenchymal silicosis according to large autopsy studies; however, temporal sequence could not be con /uniFB01 rmed. 8,9 LN /uniFB01 brosis impairs the elimination of silica dust from the lung, increasing the lung dust burden, which likely contributes to the development of parenchymal silicosis. 9 Therefore, patients with LNonly silicosis are at a much higher risk of developing parenchymal silicosis, a devastating and often progressive disease with no effective treatment.\nOur /uniFB01 ndings have several limitations. One experienced interventional pulmonologist performed 97% of all EBUSTBNA procedures, possibly limiting the results ' generalizability. The cytology review was performed by 1 pathologist, which precluded assessment of interobserver agreement for silicosis-related cytopathological /uniFB01 ndings. Only 19-G Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) needles were used in this study; therefore, the effect of different needle sizes on the DY was not assessed. The majority of patients were exposed to both RCS and coal dusts, which creates the diagnostic possibility of mixed dust pneumoconiosis, not only chronic silicosis. However, coal dust exposure is unlikely to have signi /uniFB01 cantly affected study results since coal worker pneumoconiosis and chronic silicosis have somewhat similar radiologic features and share some pathologic characteristics. 17 Recent data show that exposure to RCS appears causal in the surge of severe pneumoconiosis among coal miners. 38",

      "content": "Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA can effectively diagnose LN and parenchymal silicosis in the appropriate clinical-radiologic context. In patients with suspected silicosis and well-de /uniFB01 ned silica dust exposure, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA does not change the preprocedural presumed diagnosis of silicosis. Therefore, a high degree of suspicion for alternative diagnoses is required before considering Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA. Prospective research is needed to validate the silicosis-related cytologic criteria used in this study, especially to assess interobserver agreement among pathologists. Prospective longitudinal studies are also needed to understand more clearly the disease process in patients with silicosis and coexisting granulomatous disease.",
