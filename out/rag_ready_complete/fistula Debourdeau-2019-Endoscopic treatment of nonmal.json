In such cases, the treatment is palliative, mostly applying partially covered metallic stent [1, 2], but the prognosis remains very poor mainly related to tumor progression.\nERF occurring in a benign setting is a challenging clinical issue that affects the patients' quality of life and leads to significant pulmonary morbidity and mortality. The etiologies of ERF include complications of invasive ventilation [3, 4], anastomotic complications after esophageal surgery [5, 6], trauma such as foreign bodies [4], or caustic ingestion [7].\nThe most commonly performed surgical treatment in nonmalignant ERF consists of soft tissue interposition flaps or 2-layer technique for esophagus closure and concomitant resection and reconstruction of the trachea, with more than 90% of efficacy [4].

Moreover, despite these good outcomes, surgery is associated with a significant morbidity, greater than 50% [4]. In the literature, the modalities of surgical treatment are more precisely described than endoscopic treatment [4, 8]. Indeed, only few endoscopic studies are available and limited to case reports and small series mixing malignant and benign etiologies [9]. Consequently, the outcomes and the therapeutic modalities are still unclear in ERF that underwent an endoscopic management.\nThus, we conducted this study to expose our experience in managing ERF in our tertiary center, trying to propose a therapeutic strategy.",

A retrospective review of our database was carried out from July 2012 to December 2016 to identify patients with ERF treated endoscopically.\nThe inclusion criteria were as follows: (i) ERF treated by endoscopy, (ii) fluoroscopic confirmation of the fistula during the endoscopy, (iii) benign etiology of the fistula, and (iv) age over 18 years old. Exclusion criteria were (i) age < 18 years old, (ii) patient referred to our unit before July 2012, (iii) malignant ERF, (iv) esophago-pleural fistula, and (v) incomplete data in medical file. The diagnosis of ERF was based on the presence of bronchography at esophageal contrast injection under X-rays, during the upper GI endoscopy.\nThe  data  collected  were  (i)  patient  demographics including sex, age at diagnosis, body mass index, albumin at diagnosis, history of previous radiation therapy, and clinical presentation; (ii) ERF characterization: etiology, ERF location, and orifice size, and type and number of treatments applied. The size of the fistula's orifice in GI endoscopy was divided in three comprehensive groups: I-'punctiform' if the diameter was less than the diameter of a closed biopsy forceps, II-'medium' if the size was larger but without visibility of tracheo-bronchial tree, and III-'large' if bronchial tree was seen throughout the fistula's orifice with the endoscope (Fig. 1). The baseline date for analysis was defined as the date of the first fluoroscopic ERF diagnosis during endoscopy.",

Thus, in situation of recent fistula and small orifice with smooth and nonfibrotic edges, Over-the-scope clip (OTSc, Overco, Tubingen, Germany) placement was attempted. If OTSc placement was unsatisfying or technically not feasible, because of a large orifice (> 10-15 mm) or fibrotic edges, an esophageal fully covered self-expandable metallic stent (FC-SEMS) was inserted. Different types of FC-SEMS were used, depending on operator's experience and on the new devices available over the period of inclusion. In case of stricture associated to the fistula, the FC-SEMS was used to treat both the leakage and the stricture. Monopolar coagulation of the orifice's edges or endoclip placement for closure could also be applied. Several modalities of treatment could be associated in a combined approach. At the end of the procedure, a contrast injection under fluoroscopic control was always performed, to check for the absence of persisting leakage.\nThe esophageal stent was removed after 6 weeks to avoid ingrowth, to re-evaluate the fistula, and eventually to perform an additional treatment in case of persistence of leakage.",

      "title": "Discussion",
      "content": "Surgical treatment of benign ERF is widely described than endoscopic treatment. Indication for surgery is retained for post-intubation perforations and for cervical esophageal fistulas with cervical approach [4, 10]. This approach is used in more than 95% of cases of surgical repair of ERF located in upper and middle esophagus [4]. The other option, which consists of thoracic approach with thoracotomy, is more difficult and morbid, explaining that endoscopic treatment may be preferred in case of distal ERF. Several additional reasons lead to the promotion of endoscopic management, such as complex history of prior thoracic surgeries, patients in poor clinical conditions, or if patients refuse surgery.\nDefinitely, for nonmalignant ERF, healing the fistula has to be the main therapeutic objective. With 22 patients included, our series offers the largest sample documentation of the endoscopic management in an exclusively nonmalignant homogeneous ERF population, demonstrating endoscopic successful closure and functional efficacy of 45 and 55%, respectively. To date, data about the endoscopic management were missing. One single series described a population of 35 ERF, including malignant ( n =  25) and nonmalignant ( n =  11) etiologies, surprisingly showing a very high rate of success (80%), given the complexity of such pathology [9]. However, they considered patients with definitive stent in place as cured and they did not mention follow-up time or potential recurrences. Other reports are limited to case reports or limited case series [11-13].\nIn another hand, functional efficacy was difficult to achieve, even with covered stent, mainly because their diameter was insufficient to seal the orifice completely. Swinnen et al. [14] described the use of partially covered SEMS for the treatment of benign upper GI leaks and perforations, with a long stenting duration (83 days). This method led to the development of a growing tissue around the stent flanges avoiding migration and liquid flow from above. The stent was either left in place or removed applying the 'stent in stent' technique. Thus, this approach may be interesting in case of failure after 6 months of endoscopic treatment, in order to address pulmonary aspiration-related complications and decrease the death rate.\nRegarding therapeutic modalities, most of the patients underwent covered SEMS placement (91%). Interestingly,\nOTSc did not appear as a good therapeutic option, since only 25% of the patients had success, and it was always associated with the presence of a SEMS. We hypothesized that a recurrence occurred in most of the cases because of a secondary necrosis of the tissue grasped by the clip inducing its release and a reopening of the fistula. Consequently, we believe OTS clipping has to be avoided for treating ERF, and that esophageal SEMS are the cornerstone of the endoscopic treatment. The only issue with the stenting is the occurrence of related adverse events, especially migration. However, our migration rate was not dramatically high (18%) for fully covered SEMS and might be decreased thanks to the newly designed stents such as Double type of Beta stents (Taewoong Medical, Seoul, Korea), dedicated to fistula management.\nRegarding the factors influencing the prognosis, the main findings were that the absence of healing after 6 months of endoscopic treatment was significantly associated with a final failure healing in univariate and in multivariate analysis. We also showed a significant impact of the orifice's size, with no mortality in punctiform group and more than 70% of mortality for the patients who had fistula with direct visibility (group III) of the bronchial tree. All the deaths were due to pulmonary complications, despite the SEMS. Because of the reduced sample size, we could not identify other factors, but some results remain interesting. Thus, dilatation-related ERF tended to have a better prognosis (100% of closure p =  0.062). There was no difference in terms of fistula's healing with regard to previous radiation therapy, even if patients without previous radiation therapy seemed to heal more quickly (44 days vs. 167 days p =  0.092). This is consistent to what we demonstrated previously for anastomotic leakages after esophageal surgery for cancer [15]. In the literature, the role of radiation therapy is controversial since two studies showed an increased mortality after this treatment [16, 17], whereas some reports do not confirm any impact [18, 19].\nBasically, with 45% of fistula closure the result of endoscopic management is not satisfying; however, a few key points may be underlined with direct impact on clinical practice. First, fistulas with punctiform and medium orifices had better chances to heal than large ones (67 and 50% vs. 14%, respectively), so an endoscopic treatment using mainly SEMS must be attempted. Second, if the fistula has not closed after 6 months of management, partially covered stent (to achieve functional success) or surgery must be discussed, depending on patient's clinical condition (Fig. 4). The retrospective results of this study have led us to reconsider ERF surgery for large ERFs, even in patients with comorbidities.\nIn conclusion, nonmalignant ERF is a challenging issue that can be managed by endoscopy in selected cases with punctiform or medium orifices. We need to improve technique and tools to be able to close larger fistulas.",
