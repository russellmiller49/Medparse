      "title": "Imaging and Pleural Sampling",
      "content": "Chest imaging modalities, including thoracic ultrasound (TUS), computed tomography (CT) scan, and positron emission tomography (PET) all effectively demonstrate the presence of a pleural effusion. TUS and CT scans are practical tests frequently used to detect /uniFB01 ndings suggestive of malignant pleural involvement. In one study, TUS distinguished benign from MPE with a sensitivity of 73% and speci /uniFB01 city of 100% when pleural nodularity and pleural and diaphragmatic thickening were present. 4 Another study incorporated CT pleural abnormalities with various extrapleural and extrathoracic /uniFB01 ndings to derive a prediction score for MPE with a sensitivity of 88% and speci /uniFB01 city of 94%. 5 PET/CT has both a high sensitivity and speci /uniFB01 city for MPE. A recent systematic review and metaanalysis found that a visual/qualitative image analysis was superior to semiquantitative assessment, with a positive and negative likelihood ratio of 9.9 and 0.1, respectively. 6 Nevertheless, studies examining the utility of chest imaging to diagnose MPE are heterogeneous in design, data reporting, and patient population, 6 -8 and the performance of TUS and CT remain inconsistent. For example, in one recent cohort study, the negative predictive value of using CT as a suggestive tool was only 64.9%. 9 Therefore, at present, chest imaging primarily serves a supplementary role in enhancing the suspicion of malignant pleural disease, which may be useful when more de /uniFB01 nitive diagnostic means are not possible. Future areas of investigation could focus on TUS assessment of tissue movement and strain and various CT machine learning algorithms, both of which have shown promise in evaluating nonmalignant pleural effusion (NMPE). 10 -12\nChest imaging does, however, play a central role in establishing MPE by guiding pleural sampling. US-directed thoracentesis with cytologic examination of pleural /uniFB02 uid remains the recommended /uniFB01 rst step in evaluating MPE. 13,14 Overall yield is ~50% 15,16 and varies due to many factors. Tumor type appears to be an important variable, with MPE cytologic yields highest from adenocarcinomas of various organs and lowest from mesothelioma. 16,17 Submitting /uniFB02 uid samples > 50 to 100 mL or repeating thoracentesis more than once is unlikely to signi /uniFB01 cantly enhance yield on an initial cytology-negative pleural effusion. 7,14,18 -20 Depending on patient factors and local resource availabilities, transthoracic pleural biopsy may then be pursued for diagnosis. Chest imaging can successfully direct the clinician in this context.\nTUS- and CT scan-guided pleural biopsy substantially improve MPE diagnosis, as ' blind ' transthoracic needle approaches often have yields that are similar or inferior to thoracentesis. 21 -23 In one study, TUS-guided pleural biopsy increased yield over /uniFB02 uid cytology obtained by TUSthoracentesis from 31% to 89%. 24 Similarly, in 2 separate studies, CT-guided pleural biopsy enhanced diagnosis over both ' blind ' biopsy 25 and TUS-guided biopsy. 26 In properly selected patients such as those with suggestive pleural abnormalities, an algorithmic approach incorporating TUS and CT-guided transthoracic pleural biopsy can achieve diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy of over 90% and help avoid more invasive sampling. 27\nEven though using PET/CT to target FDG-avid pleural disease is intuitive, its diagnostic role in this context\nis not clear. In the TARGET randomized controlled trial (RCT), PET/CT-guided pleural sampling was not superior to CT sampling in patients with a previously inconclusive pleural biopsy but with ongoing clinical suspicion for malignant pleural disease. 28 Repeating CT-guided sampling or a more invasive approach may be appropriate in these cases.",

      "title": "Pleural Fluid (PF) Biomarkers",
      "content": "Biomarkers are measurable substances that may assist in the prognostication, diagnosis, management, and monitoring of a disease. PF biomarkers can have diagnostic value within the setting of cytology-negative MPE and are the focus of substantial research. They may be used individually or in combination with other biomarkers and/ or clinical variables. However, for biomarkers to be useful, they need to be accurate, reproducible, widely available, cost-effective, and have a short turnaround testing time. Unfortunately, to date, most PF biomarkers lack many of these attributes, and their application remains unstandardized, thus limiting their clinical use. While a comprehensive review of all candidate PF biomarkers is beyond the scope of this update, below is a brief summary of several that have the potential for future clinical application.\nSoluble proteins (SPs) are widely available biomarkers. SPs studied in MPE include lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), adenosine deaminase (ADA), neuron-speci /uniFB01 c enolase (NSE), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen (CA)-125, CA15-3, CA19-9, fragment of cytokeratin (CYFRA) for carcinoma, among others. Generally, overall sensitivity of individual SPs for diagnosing MPE are consistently suboptimal (~50% or lower), while speci /uniFB01 cities can approach 100%. 7 In combination, for example with CEA + CYFRA21-1 in adenocarcinomas or when integrated with clinical characteristics using arti /uniFB01 cial intelligence and machine learning algorithms, performance improves but remains inconsistent, particularly diagnostic sensitivity. 29 -32 In a meta-analysis, the serum LDH to PF ADA ' cancer ratio ' was found to have high diagnostic accuracy for MPE (97% sensitivity, 89% speci /uniFB01 city). 33 However, this study was limited by using different threshold values and patient selection bias. In a separate analysis neither serum to PF-CEA ratio or serum to PF-CEA delta value added any diagnostic bene /uniFB01 t to PF-CEA. 34 Pleural mesothelioma (PM)-speci /uniFB01 c SPs are discussed in Part 3.\nAnother important class of emerging biomarkers is cell-free (cf) molecules, such as DNA, mRNA, microRNA, and long-coding RNA. Malignant cells release these tumorderived products which tend to be present in higher concentrations in the local visceral compartment compared with plasma. Consequently, assessing the presence and relative concentration of these molecules in /uniFB02 uid ( ' liquid biopsy ' ) can be useful for diagnosing cytology-negative MPE and also assist in pro /uniFB01 ling the tumor genome for potential therapeutic targeting. 35,36 While immunohistochemistry (IHC) is the traditional standard for evaluating targetable genetic mutations and molecular markers in advanced malignant disease, 37,38 next-generation sequencing (NGS) has emerged as an ef /uniFB01 cient and comprehensive testing alternative for both tissue and cell-free /uniFB02 uid. 39,40 For example, Nong et al 39 compared the utility of IHC and an integrated NGS platform for detecting EGFR mutations and ALK and ROS1 rearrangements within tumor tissue. NGS results were more informative and reliable than IHC staining for EGFR alterations, especially for the exon\n2\n|\nwww.bronchology.com\n19 region. NGS also increased the detection of ALK rearrangements and decreased false positive ROS1 rearrangements of IHC, suggesting the need to con /uniFB01 rm IHCALK negative and/or ROS1 positive results with NGS.\nNGS performance characteristics have also shown favorable results when applied to pleural /uniFB02 uid. In 2 recent studies, NGS pleural /uniFB02 uid cf-DNA testing was superior to plasma cf-DNA in the detection of actionable mutations in patients with lung adenocarcinoma-MPE. 36,41 In the study by Mahmoodand colleagues, cf-DNA analysis was diagnostic in 90.7%, which was higher than cytology, biopsy, and plasma cf-DNA (48.4%, 88%, and 72.7%, respectively). PF cf-DNA analysis also detected unique mutations, possibly leading to a more thorough molecular pro /uniFB01 ling and clonal heterogeneity assessment. In another study, capture-based targeted sequencing of a 520 lung cancer -related genetic panel provided comprehensive pro /uniFB01 ling of cytology-negative MPE supernatant, including reliable EGFR mutational detection. 42 Nevertheless, despite the growing body of promising evidence supporting the diagnostic role of pleural /uniFB02 uid ' liquid biopsy, ' as with SPs, cf-nucleic acid assays are limited by the need for standardization. They are also costly and have long turnaround times.\nFinally, the tumor-immune microenvironment will likely serve as both a useful diagnostic and therapeutic landscape for MPE. The diagnostic utility of various immune-related biomarkers is under study. Family with sequence similarity 83 member A (FAM83A) is a recently discovered oncogene that is overexpressed in many cancers including non -small cell lung cancer (Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)). It modulates immune activity by impacting cytokine and chemokine pro /uniFB01 les, altering the local extracellular matrix, and enhancing the recruitment of immunosuppressive cells. 43,44 A recent study by Liu et al 45 demonstrated FAM83A expression in 92.5% of MPE samples in lung adenocarcinoma patients, while 95.2% of non-neoplastic PF specimens were negative. This suggests FAM83A is a potentially useful diagnostic biomarker for MPE.\nMacrophage pro /uniFB01 ling through /uniFB02 ow cytometry also shows promise in distinguishing benign from MPE. Various tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), such as CD14 +CD163+, can promote cancer development through immunomodulatory effects. 46 In one study CD163+CD14 + TAMs were found at a substantially higher concentration in MPE compared with NMPE. 47 Using a cutoff level of 3.65%, TAM expression as an MPE diagnostic biomarker had a sensitivity and speci /uniFB01 city of 81.2 and 100%, respectively. The authors also commented that by estimating PF CD163+CD14+ cells, the diagnosis could be obtained one week earlier than by cytologic exam. In another study, using a 39.8% threshold the diagnostic accuracy of CD206 + CD14 + TAMs for lung cancer-MPE showed an AUC of 0.98, with 88% sensitivity and 100% speci /uniFB01 city. 48 However, the small size of these studies thus far limits further application.\nIn summary, chest imaging may assist in distinguishing benign from malignant pathology. However, performance remains inconsistent across modalities in de /uniFB01 nitively establishing MPE based on radiographic features alone, and cytohistologic con /uniFB01 rmation remains the diagnostic gold standard. Therefore, for suspected MPE patients in whom the main goal is tumor diagnosis and characterization, the primary role of chest imaging remains as an adjunct to guiding thoracentesis or pleural biopsy (Fig. 1). The accessory role for PF biomarkers is rapidly evolving but\nremains limited due to suboptimal diagnostic sensitivity of individual tests and lack of clinical utility analysis, validation and standardization of various approaches. At present, PF biomarkers may supplement more de /uniFB01 nitive diagnostic methods but should not be used solely to exclude malignancy in the setting of a pleural effusion. 7 Combining diagnosis with various therapeutic approaches in properly selected patients is discussed in Part 2.",

      "content": "The formation of MPE is governed by complex tumorhost interactions that promote robust in /uniFB02 ux and ineffective ef /uniFB02 ux of /uniFB02 uid, leading to large and often recurrent accumulation. 49 Therefore, while initial thoracentesis helps characterize MPEs and assess symptom response, subsequent pleural interventions are often required for more de /uniFB01 nitive palliation. 50 Furthermore, it appears that at initial diagnosis the risk of MPE recurrence is independent of tumor chemosensitivity or presence of targetable mutations. 7,51,52 Consequently, management should be ef /uniFB01 cient and de /uniFB01 nitive but also cognizant of patientassociated factors that impact important outcomes and in /uniFB02 uence the cost-effectiveness of the chosen approach.

      "title": "Multimodal Approaches to Managing MPE",
      "content": "The primary de /uniFB01 nitive approaches to MPE palliation are pleurodesis, which is the /uniFB01 brotic obliteration of the pleural space, and placement of an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC). Each method has its respective advantages depending on multiple factors, and both aim to palliate the patient by controlling /uniFB02 uid reaccumulation and reducing the need for repeat procedures and health care utilization. While there are robust data supporting the success of each strategy when applied individually, the interventions may be combined in various ways to potentially further improve outcomes.\nGiven the ef /uniFB01 cacy and safety of IPCs, they are commonly utilized for managing a recurrent MPE. IPCs have the advantage of being placed percutaneously under local anesthesia and in the ambulatory setting and are successful in minimizing the need for future pleural procedures ( < 10%). 53 Furthermore, ' spontaneous ' pleurodesis occurs in up to 50% of patients which allows for catheter removal. 54 In comparison, the traditional means of chemical pleurodesis is the instillation of a sclerosant through a chest tube (eg, talc ' slurry ' ). This approach requires several days ' hospitalization and may fail in up to 20% to 25% of cases, necessitating additional pleural intervention. 1,3,54 However, chemical pleurodesis avoids the need for a chronic catheter and its attendant follow-up care resources, such as supplies and nursing. 55\nFor patients in whom both pleurodesis and IPC removal are important and achievable treatment goals (eg, life expectancy > 30 days and presence of expandable lung), these 2 approaches can be combined in an ambulatory setting to enhance the ef /uniFB01 ciency of MPE palliation. 7 This recommendation is primarily supported by the IPC-Plus RCT. 56 Bhatnagar and colleagues randomized 154 patients with MPE and expandable lung to undergo IPC placement, followed on day 10 by either talc slurry administration or placebo via IPC, all performed in an outpatient setting. The talc+IPC group had a signi /uniFB01 cantly higher rate of successful pleurodesis at day 35 (43% vs. placebo 23%, P = 0.008), which persisted at day 70 (talc 51% vs. placebo 27%, P = 0.003). Secondary end points, including improvements in MPE-related symptoms and quality of life, also favored the talc+IPC group.\nMultimodal management of MPE can also be achieved by medical thoracoscopy (MT). Also known as ' pleuroscopy, ' MT is practiced at many centers and may be performed under moderate sedation, monitored, or general anesthesia. While talc administration by MT has not been shown to be superior for achieving pleurodesis compared to delivery via a chest tube, 1,57 MT has several potential advantages when applied in a multimodal fashion. Reliable pleural biopsy for diagnostic and molecular analysis, instillation of the pleurodesis agent (ie, ' poudrage ' ), and IPC placement can all be performed during a single procedural setting. The success of combining pleuroscopic poudrage (PP) with concurrent IPC placement has been evaluated in 2 small observational studies. Reddy et al 58 treated 30 patients with this protocol and found that 92% achieved pleurodesis (and IPC removal) after a median of 7.54 days. The median hospitalization time was only 1.79 days. Bouajoude et al 59 compared a cohort receiving\nPP with IPC placement (PP + IPC; n = 29) to a historical control group who had received PP only (n = 33). They found high rates of pleurodesis success in both groups (PP + IPC 92% vs. PP 82% at 30 days, P = 0.431; median IPC placement duration of 6 d) but a decreased length of hospitalization in the PP+IPC group (median 3 d vs. PP alone 7 d, P = 0.015). Importantly, 96% of the patients in the PP + IPC group that initially achieved pleurodesis sustained this effect at 6 months, suggesting the durability of this combined approach.\nThoracoscopic inspection of the lung and pleural space can also provide valuable information that helps re /uniFB01 ne further management. For example, intraoperative histologic analysis may be used to con /uniFB01 rm malignancy before proceeding with de /uniFB01 nitive intervention in a single anesthetic event. 60 Simple pleural adhesions and loculated areas can be mobilized with the aid of forceps or blunt instruments, which may enhance the chance of lung expansion and pleurodesis. Supporting this, Suzuki et al 61 found an increased rate of spontaneous pleurodesis in patients undergoing thoracoscopic IPC placement versus Seldinger IPC placement (53% vs. 28%, P = 0.011). This advantage was further accentuated in the cohort with loculated effusions (67% vs. 21%, P = 0.009). Other studies have corroborated this /uniFB01 nding. 62 In contrast, IPC placement alone is an option if there is evidence of lung entrapment (eg, pleural rind, extensive loculations).\nDespite the potential of multimodal MT, there remains a paucity of data rigorously evaluating its advantage over unimodal or less invasive techniques. A multicenter RCT (TACTIC) evaluating PP + IPC versus PP is currently underway to help address this gap. 63 Individualizing the approach by properly identifying clinical needs, understanding patient preferences and goals, and shared decisionmaking remains crucial for success. Multimodal MT can be considered for the following select groups with symptomatic, recurrent MPEs (Fig. 2):\n/C15 Patients without lung entrapment\n/C15 Patients with good functional status (eg, ECOG 0-2)\n/C15 Patients better suited for short-term IPC only\n/C15 Patients also requiring pleural biopsy for tumor diagnosis or characterization\n/C15 Patients amenable to postprocedure hospitalization",

      "title": "Cost Considerations",
      "content": "Cost-effectiveness of a particular approach to managing MPE requires maximizing therapeutic ef /uniFB01 cacy and safety while mitigating health care expenditure. Primary cost contributors include the procedure itself, downstream associated resource utilization (such as supplies and nursing care), and the need for both immediate and future hospitalization. Patient comorbidity and life expectancy accentuate each of these factors. Therefore, navigating the cost impact of MPE management requires insight into treatment options, their associated practical and performance characteristics, disease-related factors, as well as patient prognosis and functional status. Clinical practice guidelines endorse such an individualized management strategy based on the various advantages and disadvantages of each approach, as detailed above. 3,7\nPuri et al 64 used decision tree analysis to investigate the relative cost-effectiveness of repeat thoracentesis (RT), IPC, bedside chemical pleurodesis (BP), and thoracoscopic pleurodesis (TP) for patients with either an expected 3month or 12-month survival. The model design assumed an\n4\nuncomplicated pleural space, expandable lung, and tolerance for anesthesia in every patient. Medicare allowable charges were used and incremental cost-effective ratio (ICER), which is the cost per quality-adjusted life years\ngained over the remaining lifetime for the patient, was calculated.\nFor an expected survival of 3 months, the investigators found RT was the least expensive treatment ($4946) but\nprovided the fewest (0.112) quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). This /uniFB01 nding is intuitive since while thoracentesis provides instant symptom relief, MPE recurrence necessitates repeat procedures. Therefore, the cost-bene /uniFB01 t ratio of thoracentesis is usually unfavorable, especially for patients with life expectancy of > 30 days. Notably, IPC was more cost-effective than either pleurodesis approach (BP or TP). Reasonably varying the effectiveness and morbidity estimates for each pleurodesis option did not change the outcomes in the 3-month survival model. This suggests that in MPE patients with a fairly limited lifespan, both BP and TP approaches are associated with expenditures that do not justify the qualitative results.\nIn contrast, for an expected 12-month survival, the study found that BP was less expensive and more effective than both RT and IPC. The cost of each approach was BP$13,057, IPC-$13,224, TP-$19,074, and RT-$21,377. TP was more effective than BP but ICER for TP over BP was greater than $250,000 and not sensitive to varying effectiveness and morbidity of both pleurodesis options across a clinically plausible range. In the TAPPS RCT, which demonstrated similar pleurodesis ef /uniFB01 cacy between thoracoscopic and bedside approaches, both total qualityadjusted life years and mean costs at 6 months were also similar, including after multiple imputation of missing cases. 65\nOther studies have also demonstrated the impact of prognosis on the cost-effectiveness of MPE management. Olden and Holloway 66 showed talc pleurodesis was as effective but less costly than IPC overall, though IPC became more cost-effective when life expectancy was < 6 weeks. Penz and colleagues, using data from the TIME-2 trial, showed that the overall costs of IPC and talc pleurodesis were similar. 54,55 However, in patients with survival of < 14 weeks, IPC was signi /uniFB01 cantly less costly, with a mean cost difference of more than $1000, due to mitigation of attendant supply and home nursing-related expenditures. Collectively, the data suggest that IPC is the more cost-effective approach in MPE patients with a relatively limited life expectancy, particularly when home nursing care costs are minimized.\nTo evaluate cost-ef /uniFB01 ciency based on IPC management approach, Sha /uniFB01 q and colleagues used a decision tree model and data from the ASAP, AMPLE-2, and IPC-PLUS trials. 55,67 -69 Both daily IPC drainage and combined IPCtalc pleurodesis were clinically more effective than symptom-guided drainage. However, daily drainage was not a cost-effective strategy in any scenario due to the high costs associated with home labor and supplies, resulting in an ICER of $2,474,612/QALY over symptom-guided drainage. IPC-talc was a cost-effective alternative to symptom-guided drainage, with an ICER of $59,729/QALY, but symptomguided drainage was most cost-effective for a life expectancy of < 4 months. Based on these results, when economic considerations are prioritized, the authors recommended the IPC-talc approach for candidate MPE patients with life expectancy greater than 4 months and symptom-guided drainage for all others.\nAs patient prognosis is a major factor dictating both practicality and cost-effectiveness of MPE management, its proper assessment is important. However, estimating life expectancy remains problematic in the MPE clinical setting. The development and implementation of prognostic scoring systems have been limited by heterogeneous cohorts, incomplete or imprecise prediction scores, and a rapidly\nevolving oncologic molecular and therapeutic landscape. For example, the LENT 70 and PROMISE 71 scores currently remain the only externally validated prognostic scores in MPE. However, they were developed using databases of a heterogeneous group of primary malignancies and with lung cancer EGFR -mutation prevalence of about 12% to 15%. In contrast, the SELECT prognostication model was developed in an Asian population with higher EGFR -mutation prevalence and was found to be more accurate than both LENT and PROMISE scores, although the study may have been confounded by baseline functional status. 72 In addition, a single-center observational study found that the LENT score was not prognostic for patients diagnosed with pleural mesothelioma. 73 Furthermore, LENT provides only 3 risk groups, each with de /uniFB01 ned median survivals (319, 130, and 44 d), while the PROMISE score is designed to predict 3-month survival, but not beyond. These factors may limit clinical utility in MPE patients.\nSuch factors were further highlighted by the Breast and Lung Survival Score (BLESS) Models, which developed a continuous-risk prediction model for breast and lung cancer-associated MPE. 74 The investigators found the disease-speci /uniFB01 c BLESS models more accurately represented survival in these groups compared with LENT and PROMISE, likely due to accounting for effect-measure modi /uniFB01 cations between predictors. As with biomarkers, the modeling for MPE-related life expectancy is likely to continue to evolve as additional prognostic variables are incorporated through a better understanding of oncobiology and the application of arti /uniFB01 cial intelligence and machine learning methods (Table 1).",

      "title": "Targeted Therapies",
      "content": "Targeted therapies (TTs) supplement palliative approaches by exploiting various oncobiological mechanisms that drive the formation and persistence of MPE. TTs for MPE include angiogenic inhibitors, which mitigate tumor-mediated vasoactivation and angiogenesis; immunomodulating agents targeting pathways that promote tumor survival and pleural carcinomatosis; and direct oncolytic agents (Table 2). As with targeted therapies in another malignant disease, this is a rapidly evolving landscape with therapies that remain either investigational or in the early phases of clinical implementation.\nThe vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway is an important target for directed therapy. VEGF is a primary mediator of angiogenesis in MPE, and its levels in the pleural /uniFB02 uid may correlate with pleural disease progression and prognosis. 75 Bevacizumab (BEV) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the binding of circulating VEGF to its receptors. Two prospective studies evaluated intravenous BEV combined with chemotherapy (carboplatin and pemetrexed) in nonsquamous Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 76,77 They showed response rates ranging from 46% to 61%, disease control rate of 78.6% to 87.0%, and OS of 11.7 to 18.6 months. BEV ef /uniFB01 cacy as an intrapleural agent for MPE secondary to lung cancer was reviewed in a meta-analysis of 11 RCTs. 78 Compared with cisplatin alone, the combination of cisplatin and intrapleural BEV showed a signi /uniFB01 cant increase in response while decreasing chest pain, dyspnea, and MPE VEGF expression. BEV did not seem to confer any signi /uniFB01 cant added toxicity compared with chemotherapy alone. In a phase 2 study, administration of cediranib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeting the VEGF receptor, showed an increased puncture-free\ninterval and puncture-free survival after baseline therapeutic thoracentesis. 79 Whether this potential bene /uniFB01 t extends to other TKIs or to MPE patients with actionable mutations is unclear. For example, in a recent study that evaluated 229 patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)positive lung cancer receiving osimertinib, of which 84 had MPE before TKI administration, the presence of MPE did not appear to impact survival. 80\nAntiangiogenic therapies independent of the VEGF pathway have also been explored. Endostatin inhibits proliferation, migration and differentiation of vascular endothelial cells through multiple mechanisms, thus promoting cancer cell apoptosis and reducing metastatic progression. A meta-analysis in 2016 evaluated 13 RCTs and demonstrated a signi /uniFB01 cantly improved disease control rate (pooled odds ratio of 2.97) in patients receiving intracavitary endostatin with chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone. 81 Although myelotoxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity, and liver and renal injuries are commonly associated with the use of endostatin combined with chemotherapy, these were not signi /uniFB01 cantly higher compared with chemotherapy alone.\nVarious immunotherapeutic approaches targeting the complex pleural tumor microenvironment have been investigated for MPE. 82 Interleukin-2 (IL-2) reverses cytotoxic T-cell exhaustion by several mechanisms, including reducing the expression of PD-1 and increasing interferon-gamma (IFNγ ) secretion. These effects help limit tumor-immune escape. A meta-analysis of 1279 patients receiving thoracic injection of IL-2 showed a 4.1-fold higher response rate, 7.8fold higher disease control rate, and signi /uniFB01 cantly improved quality of life compared with cisplatin-based chemotherapy alone. 83 Interleukin-based therapies appear to be safe, albeit with dose-dependent reactions including fever and /uniFB02 u-like syndrome.\nAnother emerging therapeutic strategy for MPE is gene-mediated cytotoxic immunotherapy (GMCI). An adenovirus vector is commonly used for gene transfer, and cytotoxicity is achieved through various mechanisms. One approach delivers the herpes simplex thymidine kinase gene to tumor cells (administered intrapleurally), which then selectively phosphorylates an antiherpetic prodrug (administered intravenously). This generates nucleotide analogs leading to tumor DNA damage and apoptosis. A study evaluating this method enrolled patients with Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)-, pleural mesothelioma (PM)-related and breast cancer -related MPE and demonstrated a disease control rate of 71% and median survival of 25.7 months post GMCI therapy. 84 In another model, the safety and feasibility of using intracavitary interferon gene transfer for immunogenic antitumor therapy was demonstrated in a phase 1 clinical trial of 10 patients with PM Odds ratio (or) MPE. 85 The study also found an antitumor immune response of 70%. GMCI and adenoviral vector therapies are associated with /uniFB02 u-like illness that can escalate to cytokine release syndrome and be associated with liver function abnormalities.\nThe utility of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, which has become a mainstay of managing primary lung and other malignancies when administered systemically, remains understudied in the MPE population. There is accumulating evidence that the immunogenic effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy enhance the immunomodulatory bene /uniFB01 ts of ICIs. 86 This is supported by a recent multicenter retrospective analysis of 257 patients with driver-negative nonsquamous Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)-related MPE that demonstrated a\nTABLE 1.\nDescription of Scoring Systems Used for the Prognostication of Malignant Pleural Effusions\nScoring system (year\npublished)\nMalignancies\nincluded\nVariables included",

      "content": "Recent research focusing on the genetics of PM have made it increasingly apparent that PM exhibits signi /uniFB01 cant genomic heterogeneity, with most cases featuring loss of function in tumor suppressor genes due to mutations or copy-number alterations. 91 Although the overall mutational burden in PM is lower than in other solid tumors, key tumor suppressor genes such as NF2, BRCA-associated protein 1 (BAP1), and CDKN2A are frequently affected. Mutations in oncogenes, particularly EGFR and PIK3CA, are also possible. 92 The genomic diversity of PM underscores the need for personalized approaches to diagnosis and treatment.\nWhile thoracoscopic biopsies successfully diagnose PM in up to 98% of cases, the yield of PF cytology is poor. 17,93 Therefore, PM serves as an ideal space to develop biomarkers for diagnostic purposes. BAP1 mutations have garnered signi /uniFB01 cant attention in recent studies due to their critical role in various cell survival functions. BAP1 is involved in DNA repair and chromatin modulation and serves as an essential epigenetic regulator. 94 Somatic mutations in BAP1 are present in up to 60% of PM cases. Mutations can also occur in the germline and are associated with BAP1-Tumor Predisposition Syndrome (TPDS). PM patients with BAP1 mutations exhibit a worse prognosis and distinct responses to therapy, highlighting the importance of BAP1 pro /uniFB01 ling. Other markers, such as soluble mesothelinrelated peptides (SMRP), osteopontin and blood /uniFB01 bulin-3, have only modest diagnostic performance characteristics, especially in the early stages of PM and when used in isolation. 95",

      "title": "Surgical and Systemic Therapies",
      "content": "While pleural mesothelioma remains challenging to treat, novel surgical techniques and chemo-immunotherapeutic regimens have improved survival for select patients. Surgery remains essential in many cases for diagnosis staging and palliation, but the survival bene /uniFB01 t of complete resection is still debated. Several retrospective studies have shown a bene /uniFB01 t in select patients, but this has never been replicated in a prospective, randomized fashion. Resection is not bene /uniFB01 cial in sarcomatoid disease, and pleurectomydecortication where the lung is spared is increasingly favored over extrapleural pneumonectomy. 99 Mesothelioma and Radical Surgery 2 (MARS2) trial, a randomizedcontrol trial comparing the addition of surgical resection to medical therapy, revealed a decrease in survival in those patients that had extended pleurectomy-decortication and chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone (19 vs. 24 mo, respectively). This has led many to conclude that surgical resection may no longer have any role in the treatment of PM. However, there are several study limitations that may affect its generalizability to all patients. Many of the resectable surgical patients had advanced-stage disease and many also had nonepithelioid disease, both of which are known to decrease the likelihood of success with surgery. In addition, a lower proportion of surgery patients completed adjuvant systemic therapy and less received immunotherapy compared with systemic therapy alone patients. Given the currently available evidence, surgical resection may still be considered for early-stage epithelioid PM patients with good performance status as part of multidisciplinary team in experienced centers and after extensive patient counseling. 100\nThe role of radiation therapy in the management of PM is evolving, with the primary use for the palliation of pain. Prophylactic radiation at biopsy sites is no longer\nrecommended as it has not been shown to prevent tract seeding. 99 Intensity-modulated pleural radiation therapy (IMPRINT) technique is a novel technique being explored as an adjuvant therapy. 91 Tumor treating /uniFB01 elds (TTF), which use low-intensity, alternating electrical current to interfere with cancer cell division, show promise as a future therapy now entering phase 3 trials. 99 As new techniques continue to be identi /uniFB01 ed and additional studies are conducted, it will remain critical for radiation therapy to be considered in the multimodal treatment pathway for PM patients.\nMost patients diagnosed with PM have unresectable disease, therefore systemic therapy remains the standard of care. Until very recently, this therapy included platinumpemetrexed (4 to 6 cycles) followed by maintenance BEV, as shown in the MAPS study. 101 CheckMate 743 studied 603 patients in a randomized controlled setting to assess the bene /uniFB01 t of combination nivolumab-ipilimumab versus standard of care cisplatin-pemetrexed. 102 The critical /uniFB01 nding of this study was an increased survival in those patients receiving immunotherapy (18.1 mo) versus those receiving chemotherapy (14.1 mo) without any increase in morbidity. Based on these results, the FDA has since given approval for the use of this therapy in the treatment of unresectable PM. This extended survival was some of the best reported to date using medical therapy alone for the treatment of PM. The survival bene /uniFB01 t with immunotherapy was seen in both epithelioid and nonepithelioid disease, indicating one of the few therapies that have shown any bene /uniFB01 t in the extremely treatment-resistant nonepithelioid PM. Based on the results of this study, immunotherapy is a promising new frontier for the treatment of PM. Additional studies are needed to assess the role of PD-L1 status and the generalizability of these results to potentially resectable patients. For example, nivolumab is now FDA approved for all unresectable PM patients, regardless of PD-L1 status. 103 Molecular targets like PARP inhibitors are under investigation, and immunologic therapies like CAR-T or dendritic cell, may play a role in the future. 91\nIn conclusion, there has been remarkable progress in mesothelioma research and therapy. Genomic insights, updated classi /uniFB01 cation, staging, and evolving treatment strategies offer renewed hope for PM patients, highlighting the importance of personalized care and a multidisciplinary approach. While challenges remain, ongoing research promises to enhance our understanding and improve outcomes for those affected by this devastating disease.",
