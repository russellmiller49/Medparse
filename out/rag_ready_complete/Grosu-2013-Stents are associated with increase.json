Patients with malignancy but without malignant central airway obstruction were excluded.\nAll procedural data had been collected prospectively as part of an ongoing interventional bronchoscopy registry. For patients with malignant central airway obstruction, stents were placed if (1) there was pure extrinsic compression with . 50% airway occlusion, or (2) if adequate airway patency ( . 50%) could not be achieved with ablative techniques alone, or (3) it was felt that airway reocclusion would occur quickly if a stent was not placed following ablation for a mixed obstruction. Follow-up of patients was performed by midlevel providers using a standardized algorithm. For the current analysis, we abstracted data from the medical records using a standardized form. All defi  nitions were developed prior to data abstraction and entered into a code book to ensure consistency. We abstracted data on age, sex, smoking status, pulmonary comorbidities, cancer diagnosis, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, degree and type of airway obstruction, procedure indication(s), complications, treatments for complications, and consequences of complications including hospitalizations, respiratory failure, and subsequent airway interventions.\nManuscript received July 10, 2012; revision accepted February 17, 2013.\nAffi  liations: From  the  Department  of  Pulmonary  Medicine (Drs Grosu, Eapen, Morice, Jimenez, and Ost) and the Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine (Dr Sarkiss), The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; the Department of Pulmonary Medicine (Dr Casal), Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX; and the Department of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine (Dr Almeida), Cleveland Clinic  , Cleveland, OH.\nFunding/Support: The authors have reported to CHEST that no funding was received for this study  .\nCorrespondence to: David E.

      "title": "Restenosis Due to Tumor Overgrowth",
      "content": "Fifteen patients (21%) developed restenosis due to tumor overgrowth. The median time to restenosis by tumor overgrowth was 108 days (range, 34-544 days). Tumor overgrowth was clinically signifi  cant, requiring repeat bronchoscopic intervention in 87% of cases (  Table 5  ).\nOnly preprocedure obstruction ≥ 50% was associated with tumor restenosis on univariate and multivariate analysis (Hazard ratio (HR) 5 13.71; 95% CI, 1.75-107.55; P 5 .013) (  Fig 2  ,   Table 6  ). The incidence rate of restenosis by tumor in patients with obstruction ≥ 50% at baseline was 0.0018 events per person-day.

The incidence rate risk difference, 0.0016 recurrent obstructions per\nbecause it is the risk difference that is relevant when deciding whether a stent should be placed. Previous studies have described the incidence of stent-related infections. 3,9  However, no studies have documented the baseline risk of infection in patients with malignant airways obstruction with ablation without stenting. Without knowledge of the baseline risk of infection, we cannot know the incremental risk of infection due to the stent. Without knowledge of the incremental risk, we cannot arrive at a meaningful risk-benefi  t analysis. The key numbers that this report provides are the incidence rate of infection in patients without stents (0.0011 infections per day at risk) and the incidence rate of infection in patients with stents (0.0057 infections per day at risk). Once we know the baseline risk and the risk with stents, we can calculate the incremental risk (0.0046 infections per day at risk).\nThis risk may seem low risk, but it is not. The probability that a patient will remain infection free for 30 days with a stent is (1 2 0.0057) 30   , which is 84%. Therefore, 16% of patients with stents will develop one or more respiratory tract infections by 30 days, which is consistent with other reports from the literature. 3,9 Conversely, patients without stents have a 97% chance of remaining infection free for 30 days, so there is a 3% monthly baseline risk of infection in this population.\nThe incremental risk due to stents is 0.0046 more infections per person-day at risk, corresponding to a 13% risk difference per month (number of stents to induce one infection: eight). This is clinically signifi  cant because previous studies using the same defi  nition of respiratory tract infections have shown that they are associated with signifi  cant morbidity and mortality. 9  We found similar results in this study, with 26% of patients with respiratory tract infections dying within 2 weeks of their infection (  Table 3  ).\nOur fi  ndings built on those of other investigators who have studied infectious complications following therapeutic bronchoscopy. Airway stenting has been shown to be associated with frequent bacterial colonization and infection. 3,10  A systematic review of 501 patients with airway stents found that 93 (19%) experienced a stent-associated respiratory tract infection. 3  A more recent study of airway stenting in patients with malignant disease documented that the incidence rate of infection varied by stent type, ranging from 0.004 to 0.012 infections per person-day at risk. 9  But the incidence rate of infection in patients with malignant airway obstruction who do not undergo airway stenting has not been studied in as much depth; indeed, we found only one such study, which looked at 20 patients undergoing  therapeutic  rigid  bronchoscopy  using\nablative techniques without stenting. That analysis demonstrated that there was no signifi  cant bacterial colonization as assessed by protected-specimen brush cultures. 11  To our knowledge, however, no studies before ours have compared the incidence rates of infections in patients undergoing therapeutic bronchoscopy with ablative techniques alone, with ablative techniques plus stenting.\nTo our knowledge, our study is also the fi  rst to use incidence rates and survival analysis methods to quan-\ntify the risk difference between patients with stents and those without stents for the outcome of respiratory tract infections. Most other studies of infection in patients undergoing therapeutic bronchoscopy have used incidence proportions. 3-8,12-14  As we have shown in our previous work, incidence proportions have signifi  cant limitations when used to analyze long-term complications; the incidence rate is a more appropriate measurement because it measures events per persontime at risk. 9\nSee Table 4 legend for expansion of abbreviations.\nAn  additional  benefi  t  of  using  survival  analysis methods with time-varying covariates is that we can control for factors that vary over time, such as the degree of airway obstruction and stent removal. In theory, patients with more severe airway obstruction due to tumor would be at increased risk of postobstructive pneumonia. There was a trend suggesting that patients undergoing stenting did have more severe obstruction before the procedure; however, we demonstrated that postprocedure airway patency was not signifi  cantly different between the groups, and, if anything, there was a trend suggesting that patients with stents had better airway patency than those without stents with similar degrees of baseline obstruction. Because the at-risk period begins after the procedure, this demonstrates that the observed difference in infection incidence rates between patients with and without stents was not due to differences in airway obstruction, because the patients with stents had good luminal patency after the procedure. The observed association between preprocedure airway obstruction . 50% and infection rates was therefore merely because of the fact that patients with more severe obstruction were more likely to receive stents. Stenting did alleviate the obstruction, but it also increased infection risk. Thus, even after controlling for baseline obstruction and subsequent restenosis, stents were an independent risk factor for infection.\nOur results provide additional insight into the risk portion of this decision process: Stenting is associated with increased, nontrivial risk. The clinical implication is that if ablative techniques effectively reopen the airway and there is a good chance that the tumor may respond to chemotherapy and/or radiation, a strategy of initially holding off on stenting may be warranted so that chemotherapy and/or radiation can be given a chance to work. Stenting can be held in reserve in these cases, provided there is careful airway surveillance. If the disease progresses and airway obstruction recurs despite chemotherapy and radiation, stenting is warranted. This approach minimizes the risks of infection while maintaining airway patency. Similarly, stenting is rarely needed if the degree of obstruction is , 50% to begin with, and should be avoided unless there are other indications for it, such as trachealesophageal fi  stula or to isolate an uncontrollable bleeding tumor.\nAlthough we were able to quantify the risk portion of this decision process, we were not as successful in quantifying the benefi  ts of stenting as measured by restenosis rates. We did fi  nd that restenosis was associated with more severe obstruction at baseline, but we failed to demonstrate that airway stenting signifi  cantly impacted restenosis rates; however, it is likely that these fi  ndings represent signifi  cant selection bias, as well as residual confounding. Patients judged by\ntheir physicians to be at higher risk of restenosis are more likely to have stents placed than are other patients. This is consistent with the observed trend of stent placement being more common in patients with more severe airway obstruction. It is also probable that physicians are more likely to place stents in patients whom they believe have little chance of responding to subsequent chemotherapy or radiation therapy than in other patients. If all good chemotherapy and radiation options have been exhausted, stenting is one of the few viable alternatives for treating malignant airway obstruction. Although we controlled for radiation therapy and chemotherapy before and after airway interventions, it is likely that there was signifi  cant residual confounding. Our retrospective design is not suitable for answering this question, and probably the only way to address this issue would be to conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing ablation and stenting with ablation alone.\nSimilarly, it is possible that physicians would choose to place stents more frequently in patients with less reserve and more severe comorbidities and that these comorbidities, in turn, would lead to the development of more infections. Although we controlled for Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure, type of cancer, performance status, chemotherapy, and radiation, residual confounding in this regard is still a possibility. So it may be that some of the observed increase in infection rates is due to differences in comorbidities that resulted from the patient selection process.\nAdditional limitations of this study include the relatively small sample size and the single-center design. Because of the small sample size, we could not control for different stent types, although our prior work has suggested that different stents have different rates of infection. 9  Our fi  ndings may also not apply to patients with benign diseases, so the results should be interpreted carefully.",
