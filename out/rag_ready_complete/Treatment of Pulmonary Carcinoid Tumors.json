    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pulmonary carcinoids are rare tumors originating from neuroendocrine cells in the lungs. Because of their potentially infiltrative nature, surgical resection remains the treatment of choice. However, not all patients with technically resectable disease will be able to undergo surgery, primarily because of poor lung function or medical co-morbidities. Centrally located, intraluminal tumors have been reported to be amenable to bronchoscopic treatment. We specifically examined the role of cryotherapy in the treatment of bronchial carcinoid tumors. METHODS: Sixty-three patients (52.38% female) who underwent a combined total of 243 cryotherapy procedures for treatment of bronchial carcinoid between 1992 and 2020 in our institution were included in the study. Following discussion in multidisciplinary meetings, patients were considered for first-line cryotherapy when lung resection was deemed not possible or when they had rejected surgery. RESULTS: Cryotherapy resulted in complete remission in 21 (33.33%) patients with maximum tumor diameter less than 20 mm (mean: 11.08 mm, 95% confidence interval: 8.76-13.40), and allowed 22 (34.92%) patients with larger lesions (mean: 24.04 mm, 95% confidence interval: 18.78-29.30) to proceed with parenchymal sparing resections. Marked symptomatic relief (P<0.001) was reported by 58 (92.06%) patients. The median follow-up was 33 months (range: 0 to 243 mo). One (1.59%) patient was diagnosed with recurrence in a contralateral lobe 3 years after surgery and was treated with radiofrequency ablation. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of a definitive randomized controlled trial comparing bronchoscopic treatment with surgical resection, we provide evidence on the safety and efficacy of cryotherapy and encourage wider adoption of this inexpensive and minimally invasive technique for treatment of bronchial carcinoids.",

      "content": "Pulmonary carcinoids are commonly identi /uniFB01 ed as slow-growing, solitary, polypoid tumors within major bronchi. They can often times lead to hemoptysis, because of their highly vascular stroma, or give rise to symptoms related to airway obstruction and postobstructive pneumonia. 1 Typical carcinoids (TCs) have less than 2 mitotic /uniFB01 gures per 2 mm 2 (or per 10 hpf) and no necrosis, while atypical carcinoids (ACs) exhibit increased mitotic activity (2 to 10 mitoses per 2 mm 2 ) and/or foci of necrosis. 2 Classi /uniFB01 cation is highly important for therapeutic and prognostic purposes; ACs have 20% chance of distant spread and 35% chance of lymph node involvement and are associated with poorer overall survival. 3 -5 Additional features of adverse prognostic signi /uniFB01 cance are female sex, large tumor size, invasion into adjacent lung and lymph vessel invasion. 6 -9\nSurgical resection is the gold standard of treatment, yet not all patients with technically resectable tumors will be able to undergo surgery at the time of presentation, either because of poor lung function or concomitant medical comorbidities. 10 Lung preserving resections may be performed in selected patients; however, the correct origin of the tumor will need to be identi /uniFB01 ed /uniFB01 rst. 11 Patients with small, centrally located,\nDOI: 10.1097/LBR.0000000000000791 Copyright © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The loss of energy from the cryogen during expansion causes drop in temperature to the surrounding local tissues, thus leading to freezing of free extracellular and intracellular molecular water, and consequent cellular destruction. Cryotherapy has been described as a safe and effective adjunct to endobronchial resection for TC tumors and, unlike other proposed treatments, it has not been associated with bronchial stenosis or other long-term complications. 15\nThis retrospective, observational study, aimed to uniquely examine the role of cryotherapy as /uniFB01 rst-line treatment for bronchial carcinoid tumors. Our analysis shows how cryotherapy in selected patients can result in de /uniFB01 nitive management or be part of a cytoreductive strategy in preparation for parenchymal sparing surgery. We provide supplementary evidence on the safety and ef /uniFB01 cacy of this technique to encourage wider adoption.",

      "content": "Patients received cryotherapy under general anesthesia and muscle relaxation. The procedure was routinely performed using /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopy through a Negus rigid bronchoscope with jet ventilation. Alternatively, /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopy was performed through an endotracheal single-lumen tube or laryngeal mask airway.\nWith the lesion in direct vision, the distal tip of the probe was placed on or within the tumor bulk and cryotherapy was applied typically for 4 minutes, with the number of applications depending upon the size, site and macroscopic characteristics of the lesion. During the initial procedure, tumor biopsy was taken for histologic con /uniFB01 rmation, either by means of cryoextraction (achieved by rapid withdrawal of the cryoprobe after freezing part of the lesion for ∼ 3 s or until evidence of visible freezing) or with the use of biopsy forceps, depending on individual operator ' s clinical judgment and/or preference. In general, we advocate the use of cryoprobe extraction over biopsy forceps, because it reduces the risk of yielding small specimen samples with severe crush artefacts in which mitotic count may be dif /uniFB01 cult to evaluate. 16 -18 Intraoperative bleeding occurring at the tumor site was controlled with boluses of 10 ml of adrenaline 1:100,000 solution and/or use of the cryoprobe at the bleeding point.\nRepeat bronchoscopy was normally scheduled within 4 to 6 weeks, to observe response to cryotherapy and reassess resectability. Further repeat procedures were performed as indicated, with tumor cryodebulking undertaken for cytoreduction and cryorecanalization undertaken for symptomatic relief. Postoperative prescription of antibiotics was tailored to individual patient ' s symptoms and signs of infection.",

      "title": "Lessons Learned Over the Years",
      "content": "As a high-volume tertiary cardiothoracic center, we have extensive surgical experience in management of thoracic tumors. Patients referred to our center for management of carcinoid are primarily offered surgical resection, as per published guidelines. 34 During the early years examined in the study, patients had been offered cryotherapy with a mainly palliative intention and with the possibility of improving the prospect of a surgical resection; the potential for a curative outcome was not an a priori factor at the onset of endobronchial treatment.\nFor patients diagnosed with TC, encouraging results from our own experience and other case studies generates interest and optimism in the possibility that cryotherapy could be curative for a subgroup of patients, especially those with purely intraluminal lesions measuring less than 20 mm. 12,35 Even though it can be argued that it may not be suf /uniFB01 cient to rely on endobronchial biopsies to exclude the possibility of residual microscopic disease, it is important to emphasize that all biopsies had been performed by experienced bronchoscopists who could accurately identify the previous site of the tumor. Complete resolution is also supported by the negative histopathologic /uniFB01 ndings in patients who underwent subsequent resections, for tumors previously treated with cryotherapy.\nFor patients with larger tumors, or evidence of extraluminal growth, a cytoreductive strategy was applied in preparation for surgery, allowing those previously considered inoperable to undergo curative procedures. As per common surgical practice, the bronchial resection line had to be de /uniFB01 ned by the tumor existent margin. In larger lesions, where obstructive phenomena can lead to formation of granulation tissue, it was not always possible to correctly identify the limits of the tumor within the airway at the time of\npresentation. In some cases, the intraluminal component of the lesion was large enough to misleadingly appear to be arising from a wider area of the airway when it was in fact only in contact with its surface and the tumor origin was evidently found to be considerably smaller. Preoperative cryotherapy resulted in successful elimination of granulation tissue and reduction of tumor size, allowing more accurate assessment of the tumor ' s exact bronchial margin (as shown in Fig. 4), thus facilitating parenchymal sparing resections. During the later years of the study, this cytoreductive approach has been extended to surgical candidates with localized central disease and no evidence of nodal involvement or distant spread, /uniFB01 t enough to undergo extensive resections, in order to avoid unnecessary loss in lung function. The addition of initial bronchoscopic cryotherapy treatments did not affect surgical outcomes and our long-term results are in keeping with similar reports in the literature. 11,36 -38\nPatients diagnosed with AC /uniFB01 t enough to undergo general anesthesia and lung resection proceeded to have surgery at earliest possible, while patients un /uniFB01 t for surgery continued to receive cryotherapy to achieve symptomatic relief and disease control. Cryotherapy alone or in combination with other nonsurgical treatments helped in alleviating symptoms but failed to provide a curative outcome to three inoperable patients with AC, while surgery provided the desired curative outcome to the two patients /uniFB01 t enough to undergo lung resection. We consider the role of cryotherapy in the management of AC to be strictly palliative with no potential for curative result; patients diagnosed with AC tumors should be surgically managed, whenever possible.",

      "content": "On the basis of these results, we continue to offer /uniFB01 rst-line cryotherapy with curative intent to patients with TC less than or equal to 20 mm and no evidence of nodal involvement or distant spread (Fig. 5). Patients with maximum tumor diameter greater than 20 mm are informed about the current lack of evidence to support successful management with cryotherapy alone and are advised to proceed with surgical resection, when medically /uniFB01 t.\nPatients with suspected nodal disease are also prioritized for surgery to allow accurate staging. Taking into consideration the unexpected /uniFB01 nding of nodal involvement in 2 surgical patients with no previous suspicion of nodal disease, and\nevidence in the literature suggesting nodal upstaging up to 13% for TC, we now offer endobronchial ultrasound lymph node biopsies to all patients with TC managed with\ncryotherapy alone. It is important, however, to note that, even though lymph node disease has been associated with worse survival for TC greater than 20 mm, survival for TC patients with\nlesions less than or equal to 20 mm is not signi /uniFB01 cantly affected by lymph node involvement. 5",

      "content": "Our study is limited by its retrospective design and moderate sample size; it is not a randomized controlled trial and is based on a single-center experience. The approach to performing the procedure is comparable among consultants and surgical trainees within our department but neither universal nor standardized. Patients considered for /uniFB01 rst-line cryotherapy were not screened against previously devised criteria but were individually assessed and discussed in dedicated multidisciplinary meetings. A signi /uniFB01 cant number of patients included in the study underwent cryotherapy procedures primarily with a palliative intent and they were characterized by variability in /uniFB01 tness levels, pulmonary function, and medical co-morbidities at the time of their presentation. Assessment of nodal involvement was not routinely undertaken for patients managed with a nonsurgical technique. Some patients had dif /uniFB01 -culty attending our clinics after completion of their treatment and were discharged to their referring physicians for long-term follow-up.",

      "title": "CONCLUSIONS",
      "content": "We recognize that there are currently no suf /uniFB01 -cient data to support a curative outcome when bronchoscopic treatment is applied to patients with pulmonary carcinoids. The results presented in our study as well as other published reports are encouraging, but further research is warranted. Cryotherapy can be performed in high-oxygen settings, is well tolerated by the patients and rarely results to complications. With our years-long experience, we wish to underline the palliative bene /uniFB01 ts of the procedure and highlight its curative potential in\ncarefully selected cohorts. In the absence of a de /uniFB01 nitive randomized controlled trial comparing bronchoscopic treatment with surgical resection, we provide evidence on the safety and ef /uniFB01 cacy of cryotherapy and encourage wider adoption of this inexpensive and minimally invasive technique for treatment of bronchial carcinoids, especially at a time when advancement of bronchoscopic navigational techniques will allow more patients in the future to undergo diagnostic and therapeutic procedures without being subjected to the risks involved with percutaneous interventions.",
