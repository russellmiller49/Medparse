The data for 100,869 lung cancer cases from 45 sources in 20 countries in Europe, North America, Asia, and Australia that were diagnosed between 1990 and 2000 were submitted to the database at CRAB. 3 Subcommittees of the SPFC analyzed this database to revise the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation system. Recommendations for changes to the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation of lung cancer were developed 4 -7 and submitted to the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) and the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC). All these recommendations were adopted by the UICC and AJCC as their seventh edition of the staging classi /uniFB01 cations for lung cancer, which were enacted in 2010, 8,9 These recommendations were also published in the /uniFB01 rst edition of the IASLC Staging Manual in Thoracic Oncology and the IASLC Staging Handbook in Thoracic Oncology. 10,11\nBecause the globally uniform assessment of nodal status is a pivotal element of the IASLC International Staging Project, a new lymph node map for lung cancer was proposed in 2009 as part of the activity of the IASLC SPFC. This new IASLC lymph node map was created to reconcile differences among maps that had been used at that time and to provide precise anatomical de /uniFB01 nitions for all lymph node stations. 12\nThe second phase of the IASLC International Staging Project began in 2009 and resulted in a new database of 94,708 cases of lung cancer diagnosed between 1999 and 2010. 13 The data were obtained from 35 sources in 16 countries in Europe, Asia, North America, Australia, and South America. Different subcommittees conducted a detailed analysis of the data from the database and proposed recommendations for revision of the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation, 14 -18 which were adopted by the UICC and AJCC as their eighth edition of the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation for lung cancer. 19,20 The changes from the seventh edition to the eighth edition were characterized by segmentation of the T categories and emphasis on the size of the solid component on computed tomography and on the invasive component on pathologic examination (Supplementary Table 1). 14,17 The M descriptor was also\nsubdivided to create the new M1c category to designate multiple extrathoracic metastases, and the seventh edition M1b was rede /uniFB01 ned to code single extrathoracic metastasis. 16 The eighth edition of the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation has been implemented since 2017 worldwide, except in North America, where it was delayed until 2018. Simultaneously, the IASLC produced the second editions of the Staging Handbook in Thoracic Oncology and the Staging Manual in Thoracic Oncology, which included the TNM classi /uniFB01 cations for lung cancer, pleural mesothelioma, thymic malignancies, and carcinoma of the esophagus and the esophagogastric junction. 21,22\nFor the second phase of the IASLC International Staging Project, in addition to the descriptors of the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation, nonanatomical elements were included in the data dictionary to prepare for the development of prognostic groups. The combination of the TNM classi/uniFB01 cation with nonanatomical prognostic factors would help to personalize evaluation of the prognosis in patients with lung cancer.",

For this phase of the project, molecular information has been collected to evaluate both its prognostic value and the feasibility of incorporating this information into the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation. In addition, for the purpose of making the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation available where detailed clinical or pathologic information is not complete, an Essential TNM system has been considered on the basis of a proposal from the UICC. 24",

The deadline for updating the follow-up data of the cases was the end of December 2021. The data sets were submitted to CRAB either by means of batch data sets or by electronic data capture (EDC). This EDC system allows contributors to submit data online and retrieve their own data for their own studies at any time.\nThe EDC system provided by CRAB contains data set elements including T, N, and M descriptors with detailed speci /uniFB01 c reasons for categorizing them in both clinical and pathologic settings. The non-TNM elements included in the database to inform the ninth edition are listed in\nSupplementary Table 2. The status of residual disease has also been a focal point, and its accuracy and availability will be essential to further validate the IASLC de /uniFB01 nitions of completeness of lung cancer resection.

The data came from 25 countries and 75 unique sites. They came from Asia and Australia (69,749 cases, 56.0%), Europe (30,827 cases, 24.7%), North America (19,608 cases, 15.7%), South/Central America (4225 cases, 3.4%), and Africa and the Middle East (172 cases, 0.1%) (Fig. 1). Data sources are found in Supplementary Table 3.\nThe submitted data were mapped to a data dictionary and checked to verify whether they included a valid histologic type, survival time, date of diagnosis window, and clinical and pathologic stages (Fig. 2). Finally, 87,043 cases were enrolled in the analysis. The most dominant source of data was the Japanese Joint Lung Cancer Registry (Japan, 23,663 cases), followed by the University Hospital Heidelberg (Germany, 8840 cases), West China Hospital, Sichuan University (China, 7345 cases), Korean Association for Lung Cancer (Republic of Korea, 4022 cases), and Samsung Medical Center (Republic of Korea, 3645 cases). The number of eligible cases\nsubmitted by each participating institution is found in Appendix 3.\nOf the 87,043 cases enrolled in the analysis, 52,069 (59.8%) were invasive adenocarcinoma, 15,872 (18.2%) were squamous cell carcinoma, 1142 (1.3%) were adenocarcinoma in situ, 1100 (1.3%) were adenosquamous cell carcinoma, 1057 (1.2%) were large-cell carcinoma, 5530 (6.4%) were SCLC, and 689 (0.8%) were large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (Table 1). Of the 87,043 cases, both clinical and pathologic stages were available in 44,831 (51.5%). In 33,268 (38.2%)/8944 (10.3%) cases, only the clinical/pathologic stage was available (Fig. 3).\nApproximately 67% of the cases underwent surgical treatment, with or without chemotherapy or radiotherapy (Table 1). Of the 77,811 cases in which clinical staging was available, the most dominant clinical stage according to the eighth edition of the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation was stage IA2 (10,402 cases, 13.4%), followed by stage IVB (9236 cases, 11.9%) and stage IA3 (7357 cases, 9.4%) (Supplementary Table 4). Of the 54,248 cases in which pathologic staging was available, 22,206 cases (40.9%) were stage IA, 9021 cases (16.6%) were stage IB, 8246 (15.2%) were stage IIIA, and 7625 (14.1%) were stage IIB according to the eighth edition of the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation (Supplementary Table 5). Numbers of cases in each stage group categorized by geographic regions are found in Supplementary Figure 1. Of the 47,933 surgical cases in which data were available,\nR0 resection was achieved in 42,623 (88.9%) (Supplementary Table 6).

The impact of molecular markers on the prognosis will be analyzed using the collected data.\nTable 2 provides the basic characteristics of the IASLC databases used to inform the seventh, eighth, and ninth editions of the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation of lung cancer. In the latter, although more patients were collected in comparison with the other two databases, more patients had to be excluded. This is due to the fact that, for this edition, international participants contributed more batch databases. These often lacked some of the essential elements needed for revision of the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation and, therefore, patients had to be excluded. This emphasizes the importance of submitting data through the EDC online system, because these data are often more complete and accurate.\nContributions from Asia/Australia have replaced Europe as the leading geographic region participating in this project, mainly because of the huge contribution from Japan. It is also important to note that the number of cases from South/Central America has increased from a mere, almost symbolic, 0.3% (190 patients) in the eighth edition to 3.4% (4225 patients) in the ninth, which is a very substantial increase. For the /uniFB01 rst time, the IASLC database has data from Africa/Middle East, 172 (0.1%) patients, which we hope will increase in future editions of the IASLC International Staging Project.\nThe number of cases with Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is about the same, but that of SCLC is slightly lower. Nevertheless, among\nthe 8357 cancers classi /uniFB01 ed as ' other, ' there are typical and atypical carcinoids, large-cell neuroendocrine carcinomas, and 1577 multiple synchronous primary tumors. These will be very useful for validating the classi /uniFB01 cation of lung cancers presenting with multiple lesions proposed in the eighth edition of the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation. 25\nMultifaceted analyses of the database will be performed on the basis of the strategic method designed by the validation and methodology subcommittee of the SPFC. 26 This analysis of the database should provide /uniFB01 ndings that will be re /uniFB02 ected in the proposals to change the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation system. The main proposals will be published in the Journal of Thoracic Oncology in 2023. They will be submitted to the UICC and AJCC as recommendations for the ninth edition TNM staging system, which is scheduled to be in use in 2024.\nThe IASLC SPFC will continue its activities to improve the staging systems and re /uniFB01 ne the prognostic information of thoracic malignancies, while constantly building an up-to-date and comprehensive database. The database is also expected to be a resource for additional research studies on further detailed or focused issues.",
