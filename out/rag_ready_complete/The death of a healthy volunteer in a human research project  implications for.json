      "content": "The proximate cause of death was considered to be a toxic lignocaine blood concentration, although this must remain somewhat speculative. The lignocaine level in the emergency department blood sample was 12.9mg/L (56/lmol/L); the maximum safe concentration is less than 5-6 mg/L (22-26 umol/L). 2 This concentration was measured about three hours after the bronchoscopy, and a back-extrapolation suggests a possible maximal lignocaine blood level of about 36mg/L (l55/lmol/L). It was calculated she had been administered about 1200mg.\nThe study protocol did not specify an upper dose limit (nor did professional guidelines for the bronchoscopy pro› cedure\"), although the original study protocol of 1981 had specified a maximum dose of 300 mg. Between 1981 and 1995, the study protocol had been amended a number of times on many occasions with Institutional Ethics Com› mittee (IEC) and National Institute of Environmental Health approval but the deletion of the upper dose limit of lig› nocaine had not been submitted specifically as an amend› ment.

      "content": "A healthy 19-year-old female university student underwent a bronchoscopy at University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York, in early 1996 as part of a research investigation into the function of lung cells. Topical lignocaine was sprayed on her upper and lower respiratory tract, as is usual to allow passage of the bronchoscope, but she required considerable amounts of spray to decrease discomfort. She was discharged from the centre after a 60-minute observation period, although she complained of chest discomfort. Fifteen minutes later, her boyfriend noted that she was very uncomfortable and could barely talk. He left her at his apartment so that she could have a nap, but when he returned an hour later she was having an epileptic fit. On admission to the emergency department, she was in cardiac arrest, and she died two days later. T here was a large out-of-court settlement (perhaps approaching US$ I 00 million) between the University Medical Center and the fami ly.'\nthat deleting the upper dose limit had safety implications, reflecting contemporary practice and guidelines.\"\nThis procedure for protocol alteration was in keeping with the university's clinical research regulations (ie, minor alter› ations without safety implications did not require formal approval by the IEC). However, epileptic fitting and severe cardiac arrhythmias are well known serious adverse effects of excessive blood concentrations of lignocaine, knowledge that appeared to have become less influential or compelling up to the time of this incident.f\nThere was no record of the dose of lignocaine spray admin› istered, although Medical Center officials noted that this could be an estimate only given the expected removal by suc› tion of the drug from the airways during the procedure.\nThe young woman had been discharged 60 minutes after the procedure, although she complained of chest pain. There was no record of her being reviewed before discharge by a physician, although her routine observations were presum› ably satisfactory.",

Although the consent form made it clear that sub› jects could withdraw at any stage without prejudice to their medical care, it was not clear whether the honorarium (US $150) would be paid in this event, creating a potentially pow› erful inducement to a student to continue despite possible adverse events.\nThe IEC. Although the IEC had discharged all its statutory obligations, it had not performed an \"in-depth\" or \"com› plete\" re-review of the protocol and its alterations over the protocol's 14-year life.'\nThe protocol. Protocol violations were discovered during the NY State Department of Health investigation of the inci› dent and the IEC's procedures.' The lignocaine solution used was a higher concentration than that specified in the protocol, and 28 \"bronchial brushings\" were done, whereas the protocol specified \"about 10\". It was contended by the university that this latter violation could be classed as \"minor\". Yet, apart from indicating a level of researcher non-compliance, these violations also illustrated that the IEC had not reviewed the procedural aspects of the study closely. However, annual reports had been submitted by the researchers to the IEC, appropriately fulfilling the univer› sity's statutory \"review\" obligations.",

Regular education is needed about protocol alterations, the min› imising of risk to subjects, the methodology for obtaining informed consent, the recognition and reporting of adverse events, and the question ofhonorariums. These issues need to be discussed frequently by the research community.\nResearch project annual reports would be improved by incorporating all protocol amendments and procedural alter› ations, plus comments on how these might impinge on sub› ject safety.\nAll protocol amendments need to be reviewed and approved by IECs (this is generally the case in Australia).",

The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Statement on human experimentation' requires that an IEC be satisfied that the consent of a research subject is not influenced by any financial inducement (or by any other improper pressure).\nPayments to research subjects may affect consent and the validity of the results. Paul Dansker, a partner in the US law firm representing the family of the student who died, sug› gests that such payments may also lead to a contemptuous attitude to the research participant,' suggesting that \"inves› tigators simply don't care as much about the wellbeing of volunteers as they would if the subjects were actual patients and there existed a true physician-patient relationship\". He also contends that \"when a facility is paying a volunteer, a certain casualness can creep into the investigator's regard for the subject's welfare, leading in extreme cases to lack of compassion or even cold-bloodedness\" an attitude of \"we're paying them so what's a little discomfort?\". This remark brings into stark focus concerns about payments to research subjects and the difficult job an IEC has in deter› mining whether payments are in keeping with NHMRC principles.",

Under current NHMRC guidelines, all IECs are obligated to ensure appropriate mon› itoring of research projects until their completion.\" The guidelines establish minimum requirements, but an IEC may introduce further procedures when considered necessary.\" However, in practice, most Australian IECs comply with the minimum requirements set out in the monitoring guidelines by relying on the principal investigator'swritten reports and notification of any adverse or unforeseen consequences of the project.\" Very few IECs have any systematic methods for monitoring, and only a handful report the use of site visits. 6 This reflects, in large part, the lack of resources available to IECs to undertake more monitoring work.\nThe Australian clinical research and IEC community recognises the importance of monitoring, noting that it \"... is essential if there are to be any teeth to the public watch› dog role [of an 1EC]\". 4 The 1996 review of the role and functioning of IECs recommended that an IEC has the responsibility when approving a research protocol to ensure that appropriate and adequate monitoring arrangements are in place consistent with the level of risk involved in the pro› ject to research subjects, are in place before the com› mencement of the project and that the annual compliance information form tabled by IECs with the Australian Health Ethics Committee (AHEC) includes confirmation of due monitoring procedures in place and any problems encoun› tered.!\nThis increased monitoring will place further strain on resources, a fact recognised by the review.\nHowever, monitoring by an IEC is only one aspect of the\noverall strategy to ensure protection of research subjects' interests. Peer review of research proposals and protocols, institutional supervision, researchers' individual professional ethical standards, education of researchers about ethical issues, and effective information and complaints mechanisms all promote the earliest possible detection of potential harm in research projects. Again, these activities require consid› erable commitment, organisation and resources.",

Not less than half the committee should con› sist of non-institutional, non-medical members.\n· The AHEC was advised to revise its current compliance information form to collect more detailed information so that it could meet its statutory accountability responsibility. For example, greater detail will be required on the actual documenting procedures of an IEC, the type of research considered by the IEC, and how complaints are handled.\n· The NHMRC Statement on human experimentation' needs substantial revision to apply to \"research involving humans\" rather than experimentation, and to be sub› stantially more prescriptive and detailed.\nThese recommendations are aimed at improving IEC pro› cedures and reporting to reduce the risk of similar events occurring in Australia.",
