    "abstract": "The breadth of knowledge regarding IPCs has increased substantially in the last decade. Available research has established that IPCs are effective at improving patient symptoms and minimizing hospitalization rates and lengths of stay, but are associated with a risk of potential complications. Fortunately, recent research has shown that the complication rates are relatively low, albeit not negligible. Pleurodesis rates achieved with IPCs are lower when compared with chemical or surgical pleurodesis, but IPCs are associated with a decreased need for repeat pleural procedures and similar quality of life. Understanding individual patient preferences and utilities is essential when determining optimal management for a recurrent, symptomatic pleural effusion and this information should influence treatment decisions. The future of MPE management likely lies in combined therapies, such as IPC plus a pleural sclerosant, at least in patients whose lung expands with drainage. This combination therapy may provide more optimal benefits than each individual procedure, although further research is needed. Effective pleurodesis and subsequent IPC removal is important, especially in regard to cost effectiveness and burden of catheter-related care, but future research should ideally focus on patient-centered outcomes. 15 Consistency of measurements between studies would also allow for a more direct comparison of results and add to the current body of knowledge.

      "content": "Pleural effusion is a common clinical problem estimated to affect 1.5 million people in the United States each year. 1 A large proportion are either nonmalignant or related to infection, 2 but malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) may also lead to significant health care resource use with an estimated 150,000 cases annually. 3,4 Lung cancer is the leading cause of MPE and is present in up to 15% of patients at diagnosis, with an even greater proportion of patients developing MPE at some point in the course of their disease. 5 MPE can complicate almost any cancer 6 and may also develop as the primary manifestation of a disease, as is the case with malignant mesothelioma.\nAfter the identification of a symptomatic pleural effusion, a thoracentesis is typically performed for cytologic and laboratory evaluation of pleural fluid, as well as for assessment of symptom improvement and lung re-expansion. Despite initial drainage, more than one-half of MPEs will recur within 90 days. 7 Recurrent effusions may cause significant dyspnea, cough, and chest discomfort,\nresulting in a poor quality of life for these patients. A definitive pleural procedure is recommended for patients with recurrent, symptomatic MPE, 3,6,8 except in cases of slow fluid reaccumulation, an expected rapid and marked response to treatment, or a very short life expectancy. Several options are available for the definitive management of MPE.\nIndwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) are one option for definitive MPE management. IPCs are being placed with increasing frequency since their introduction more than 30 years ago 9 and the body of evidence pertaining to their use continues to grow. Initially, observational studies and retrospective reviews comprised the majority of publications, but several larger, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are now available. Many compare IPC placement to chemical pleurodesis, either thoracoscopic or via chest tube, but the primary outcomes between studies are inconsistent, making direct comparison of results difficult. Until recently, most of the available literature on IPCs pertained to patient selection, indications, and postprocedural outcomes; however, guidelines\n* Corresponding author.",

      "title": "THERAPEUTIC OPTIONS",
      "content": "Before discussing IPCs in greater detail, it is important to review available options for the management of recurrent, symptomatic MPE. Historically, definitive treatment involved a surgical procedure and hospitalization, with a median length of stay ranging from 5 to 10 days depending on the specific procedure performed. 5 Thoracoscopic talc pleurodesis may be performed by an interventional pulmonologist in an endoscopy suite using one access port with local anesthesia and moderate sedation. A video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) pleurodesis procedure, however, is usually performed by a thoracic surgeon in an operating room. This procedure is more invasive because it typically requires multiple access ports, a double-lumen endotracheal tube, and general anesthesia. Both procedures allow for biopsy of the parietal pleura, evaluation of full lung re-expansion, lysis of simple adhesions, and adequate instillation of pleural sclerosants, but VATS may allow for improved visualization of the pleura given the lung is fully deflated. 5 VATS also provides the ability to perform complementary procedures such as mechanical abrasion, lysis of more complex adhesions, decortication for treatment of nonexpandable lung, and parietal pleurectomy, which may be beneficial in certain clinical scenarios. 5 VATS is typically reserved for patients with good functional status who are deemed acceptable surgical candidates, but for those not meeting these criteria, alternative treatment methods are typically pursued.\nChest tube drainage followed by pleurodesis with a sclerosing agent is another option for the management of recurrent, symptomatic MPE. This method may be an option for patients who are not surgical candidates or for patients who already have a chest tube in place; however, similar to VATS pleurodesis, it requires an inpatient hospital stay of several days. 10-13\nIPCs are now commonly being offered as an alternative to surgical pleurodesis and other definitive procedures. 9,14 This change is likely secondary to the ease of placement and lack of need for hospitalization and sedation, 9,10 while still providing improvement in symptoms. 15 IPC placement may be performed by a variety of practitioners, such as pulmonologists, surgeons, and interventional radiologists. The administration of talc and other sclerosants through an IPC is also\na viable treatment option in some patients and has been the focus of recent publications. 16",

Insurance often covers IPC drainage bottles and related supplies, but this factor should also be confirmed before catheter placement to avoid any interruptions in patient care.",

      "content": "Several IPC options are available and the decision to use one catheter over another depends on local availability as well as patient and provider preference. Each of the catheters have slight differences, but all are made of soft silicone and have multiple fenestrations to allow for the drainage of pleural fluid. The Merit Medical Aspira pleural drainage system is designed to drain pleural fluid with low pressure via gravity, 18 whereas the PleurX and Rocket pleural drainage systems are designed to drain pleural fluid via a vacuum bottle. 19,20\nThe details of IPC placement may vary between institutions and depending onwhatspecificcatheter is being placed, but generally are quite similar. One approach to IPC placement is provided in Box 1 . Videos for PleurX, Aspira, and Rocket catheter placement may be viewed at: https://www.bd. com/en-us/company/video-gallery?video 5 903266 637001 (procedure begins at 3:46 minutes), https:// www.myaspira.com/videos/ (insertion of a peritonealcatheter, althoughsimilarkit contents and technique), and https://sales.rocketmedical.com/ products/indwelling-drainage-catheters, respectively.\nComplications during IPC placement are rare but should be recognized because they can occur in 2.8% to 6% of procedures. Complications are similar to those encountered with any pleural procedure and include pneumothorax (generally not clinically significant because these usually arise from the entry of atmospheric air as opposed to visceral pleural injury and there will now be a catheter in the pleural space), bleeding, subcutaneous\nemphysema, pain, and unintended mispositioning of the catheter ( Fig. 1 ). 21 Postprocedure chest radiography is often obtained to document proper IPC placement and the patient is typically discharged the same day.",

Remove the guidewire introducer, leaving the guidewire in place.\n11. Use the scalpel to make an approximate 1cm incision around the wire in the patient's skin and subcutaneous tissue. This is the pleural entry site. Make a second incision approximately 5 cm from the pleural entry site. This will serve as the catheter exit site.\n12. Attach the metal tunneler to the fenestrated end of the pleural catheter and tunnel the catheter under the skin and subcutaneous tissue, entering at the catheter exit site and directing the tunneler toward the pleural entry site. Pass the tunneler out through the pleural entry site (where the guidewire is located).

It is important to acknowledge that many patients with cancer report a substantial time burden related to treatmentandfollow-upappointments 22 ; therefore,\npersonalized decision-making should be used when determining the optimal follow-up plan.\nDrainage protocols and algorithms for IPC removal vary between institutions. General recommendations are to decrease drainage frequency when output decreases to less than a certain volume, often 50 to 100 mL. 14 One example of a conservative IPC drainage and removal algorithm is provided in Fig. 2 . The reported incidence of successful pleurodesis allowing IPC removal is variable, but seems to be less than 50%. 15,23,24 Before removal, patients should be made aware of the potential need for future pleural interventions because up to 10% of pleural effusions may recur after IPC removal. 15,25",

      "title": "CONSIDERATIONS Nonexpandable Lung",
      "content": "An IPC may be placed in almost any patient and allows for regular home drainage of pleural fluid with resultant improvement in symptoms and quality of\nlife. 10,15,23,24 Specific patient populations may benefit more from IPC placement when compared with other definitive management approaches. In patients with a nonexpandable lung, where adequate apposition of the parietal and visceral pleura are not achieved after pleural fluid drainage, guidelines recommend the placement of an IPC over chemical pleurodesis. 6-8 One of the first publications to report the use of IPCs for MPE and nonexpandable lung was by Pien and colleagues in 2001, 26 when they described their experience with 11 patients, 3 of whom had previously been treated with radiation therapy, attempted talc pleurodesis, or decortication without successful resolution of symptoms. Although the specific details regarding how symptom and radiographic improvement were determined were not provided, all patients were reported to have symptomatic benefit in cough, dyspnea, and exercise tolerance. 26 Several larger observational studies on the use of IPC for patients with nonexpandable lung have since been published, each reporting various patient outcomes, including symptom improvement, pleurodesis rate, median survival after IPC placement, and complications. 27-32 It is difficult to directly compare results from these studies because the units of measurement for the outcomes are quite variable, but most studies report symptomatic improvement in the majority of patients. More recent RCTs have shown improvement in dyspnea and quality of life that is comparable with that achieved in patients with a fully expandable lung after talc pleurodesis. 10 It should also be noted that, in the AMPLE-2 trial, approximately 50% of patients with a nonexpandable lung achieved pleurodesis at 6 months. 23 In addition to patients with a nonexpandable lung, IPC placement may be the best treatment strategy for those with interconnected pleural loculations, especially if deemed a poor surgical candidate. 7",

Swimming, submerging in bath water, diving, or otherwise performing activities that may result in soaking of the IPC dressing are not recommended for some of the IPCs owing to fears of an increased risk of infection; however, there are no data to support this supposition.

More recent publications, however, emphasize patient-centered outcomes such as dyspnea, quality of life, complications, and hospital length of stay. 10-12,23 It is from these studies that we know IPCs improve patient symptoms, but are only associated with modest improvements in quality-adjusted lifedays and utility. The greatest improvements are seen in patients with worse baseline shortness of breath and those who pursue systemic chemotherapy or localized radiation after placement. 15 There are also potential disadvantages to treatment with an IPC, including complications, cost, and the need for regular drainage procedures.

      "title": "CLINICAL OUTCOMES Pleurodesis Rates",
      "content": "Because IPC use is increasing and drainage may be performed at the convenience of the patient, investigations to identify optimal drainage regimens\nhave been conducted. Two RCTs, ASAP (Impact of Aggressive vs Standard Drainage Regimen Using a Long Term IPC) and AMPLE-2 (Australasian Malignant PLeural Effusion-2) evaluated patient outcomes with various drainage regimens. The ASAP trial compared daily with every other day drainage of the same volume of fluid, 24 whereas the AMPLE-2 study compared daily with symptom-guided IPC drainage. 23 Both studies defined pleurodesis as pleural fluid drainage of less than 50 mL on 3 consecutive drainage attempts and improved radiographic scores, but the ASAP trial also specified a lack of patient symptoms. 23,24 Each study determined that daily IPC drainage was more likely to result in either complete or partial pleurodesis after IPC placement, with associated fewer catheter-days, when compared with a less aggressive drainage regimen, although pleurodesis rates were not the primary outcome in the AMPLE-2 trial. 23,24 Most cases of pleurodesis and catheter removal occurred in the first 60 days after placement. 23,24 If IPC removal is a patient priority, then an aggressive drainage regimen should be used, but in instances when this is not a strong consideration, symptom-guided drainage is reasonable. 4\nThe pleurodesis rates of IPC in conjunction with pleural sclerosants has also been evaluated. Bhatnagar and colleagues 16 randomized patients to IPC plus talc slurry or placebo and found those treated with IPC plus talc slurry achieved pleurodesis at a significantly higher rate, at least during the initial follow-up period. A small study evaluating the safety of silver nitrate-coated IPCs also reported high pleurodesis rates with a median time to pleurodesis of 4 days. No formal conclusions can be drawn from this study given the small sample size, but results from a larger, multicenter RCT should be available in the near future. 36\nWhereas patient-centered outcomes should be a priority when managing recurrent MPE, pleurodesis rates are important from a cost perspective. A recent analysis evaluating the cost effectiveness of various drainage regimens and IPC plus talc administration determined daily IPC drainage was not cost effective in any clinical scenario. 37 Symptom-guided IPC drainage was most cost effective for patients with a life expectancy of less than 4 months or an expected probability of pleurodesis greater than 20%. 37 Considering individual patient-related factors such as life expectancy and desire to minimize catheter-days, IPC plus pleural sclerosant administration may provide a palliative and cost-effective option for the treatment of recurrent, symptomatic MPE. 37\nThe optimal IPC drainage regimen in patients with a nonexpandable lung is less clear than in\nthose with a fully expandable lung because of a lack of formal studies evaluating this topic. Approximately one-third of the patients included in the AMPLE-2 trial had nonexpandable lung. Although patients with a nonexpandable lung had an overall lower pleurodesis rate than patients whose lungs expanded, aggressive IPC drainage was still associated with a higher pleurodesis rate when compared with symptom-guided drainage in patients with nonexpandable lung. 23 Although this data may provide insight as to the effect of daily drainage on patients with a nonexpandable lung, it should be interpreted with caution because it was obtained after a post hoc analysis of very few patients. If catheter removal is a priority, then an aggressive IPC drainage strategy can be considered, even in the setting of a nonexpandable lung, but in patients who experience significant discomfort with daily drainage, this regimen is not recommended. 4\nChemical pleurodesis rates are variable and depend on the sclerosing agent as well as the underlying method of instillation. 25,38 IPC-related pleurodesis rates are typically lower when compared with chemical or surgical pleurodesis performed as a slurry via chest tube or via poudrage, but as discussed elsewhere in this article, patient-centered outcomes, rather than the achievement of pleurodesis, may be the best measures of successful MPE management. 15,25",

Both groups experienced an improvement in dyspnea and there was no significant difference between the 2 groups at 3 months, but at 6 months patients with an IPC had less dyspnea than patients who underwent talc pleurodesis. 10 A second, smaller RCT compared IPC with talc pleurodesis with the primary end point being improvement in the baseline Modified Borg Score. Again, dyspnea improved in both groups after the intervention, but the magnitude of improvement was not significantly different between the 2 groups. 12 Twoother RCTsevaluated both dyspnea and quality of life improvement in patients with IPC compared with chemical pleurodesis. 11,13\nWhereas the measurements of breathlessness and quality of life were different in the 2 studies, both reported high baseline breathlessness scores and poor quality of life that improved after the respective interventions. Putnam and colleagues 13 noted that patients with IPC had significantly improved Borg scores after exercise at 30 days when compared with the doxycycline pleurodesis group, but this difference was not sustained throughout the follow-up period. No other significant between group differences were identified in breathlessness or quality of life in either study. 11,13 Onepropensitymatched observational study compared symptom palliation in patients with IPC versus VATS talc pleurodesis. Although the long-term follow-up was poor, no significant difference in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was identified. 39 A review of the available data shows that IPC placement leads to an improvement in breathlessness and quality of life comparable with that achieved with chemical pleurodesis. In addition, the combination of IPC plus talc slurry administration further improves patient breathlessness and quality of life scores at various timepoints when compared with IPC alone. 16 The usefulness of other pleural sclerosants in conjunction with IPCs is currently being evaluated.\nIPC drainage regimens have also been evaluated for their effect on symptom improvement. In the AMPLE-2 study comparing daily versus symptom-guideddrainage,therewasnosignificant difference in the mean daily breathlessness or quality of life as measured on a 100-mm visual analog scale between the 2 groups; however, patients in the daily drainage group reported a better quality of life than patients in the symptom-guided group as measured by the EuroQoL-5 Dimensions-5 Levels. 23 Similar improvements in both the Karnofsky Performance Score and the RAND 36-Item Short Form Health Survey scores were obtained in the ASAP trial comparing daily versus 3 times a week drainage. 24 IPC drainage regimen does not seemtohaveasignificanteffectonbreathlessness, but there are conflicting data on whether quality of life is impacted by drainage strategy.",

      "content": "Patients with MPE spend a substantial amount of time in the hospital, and decreased hospitalization rates and shorter lengths of stay are a priority for many, especially near the end of their life. 11 Two RCTs have compared IPC placement with chemical pleurodesis and evaluated hospital length of stay as the primary study outcome. The AMPLE (Australasian Malignant PLeural Effusion) trial found that, in those treated with an IPC, there\nwas a significant decrease in total hospitalization days within the first year after the initial procedure, including the initial hospitalization. Putnam and colleagues 13 also determined that the initial hospital length of stay was significantly shorter for the IPC group when compared with the pleurodesis group. Two other studies have evaluated hospital length of stay in patients undergoing IPC placement versus talc pleurodesis as a secondary outcome and also found an IPC shortens the duration of the initial hospitalization. 10,12 A smaller observational study came to the same conclusion as these larger RCTs when comparing IPC versus VATS talc pleurodesis. 39 Overall, it is clear from the literature that IPC placement is associated with fewer hospitalization days when compared with chemical pleurodesis using either chest tubes or thoracoscopy.\nAlthough the need for additional procedures has not been the primary outcome of any available study, IPC placement is associated with a significantly decreased need for ipsilateral pleural fluid drainage when compared with either chest tube or thoracoscopic chemical pleurodesis, and this difference becomes more evident the longer patients are followed. 11,12,39,40\nFrom a health care cost perspective, the initial hospitalization required for thoracoscopic or chest tube pleurodesis is more costly, but a comparison with IPC requires consideration of life expectancy and total cost over the life of the patient to manage the problem of MPE. For patients with a shorter expected survival duration, the total costs of IPC strategies may be lower, whereas for those expected to live longer, chemical pleurodesis may prove to be less expensive because the cost for supplies related to continued IPC use would be less. 37 These cost considerations must be balanced against any differences in qualityadjusted survival. 37 Individual patient preferences strongly impact perceived utility and quality of life, so cost-effectiveness analysis should be applied appropriately and with caution, making sure to take into account individual level factors for each decision.",

      "content": "The cause of nonmalignant pleural effusions (NMPEs) is quite variable, but congestive heart failure, hepatic hydrothorax, chylothorax, and\nend-stage renal disease are the most common. Management of the underlying disease process is the mainstay of treatment, but symptomatic NMPEs may persist despite optimal management. It should also be noted that patients with advanced heart and liver disease who have pleural effusions may have similar mortality rates to patients with MPE. 41,42 Whereas IPCs were initially designed for treatment of MPE, their use in patients with NMPEs is increasing. Older publications included patients with a variety of etiologies for their NMPE and are composed primarily of low-quality non-RCTs. Newer studies, however, have evaluated the safety and efficacy of IPCs for NMPEs from specific etiologies. This finding is important because the efficacy and complication rates of IPCs varies significantly based on the underlying cause of the effusion.\nComplication rates of IPCs when used for hepatic hydrothorax are indeed higher than with MPE. Shojaee and colleagues 43 published a multicenter retrospective evaluation of IPC use in patients with refractory hepatic hydrothorax. No specific information regarding symptom improvement was provided, but 28% of patients experienced pleurodesis, allowing for IPC removal. However, the observed infection rate in this population was 10% with an associated 2.5% mortality rate. 43 Other studies of drainage procedures for patients with hepatic hydrothorax have reported even higher infection rates ranging from 16% with IPCs up to almost 50% with chest tube placement and hospitalization. 44,45 Infectious complications are nottheonlyconcernwithIPCuseforhepatichydrothorax. Electrolyte disorders, renal failure, and protein loss are other things to consider when placing anIPCfortreatment of refractory hepatic hydrothorax. In contrast with hepatic hydrothorax, IPCs are generally well-tolerated and associated with a relatively low risk of infection in patients with congestive heart failure, with most studies reporting empyema rates between 0% and 4%. 45 Pleurodesis rates in patients with congestive heart failurerelated effusions may also be higher compared with those with hepatic hydrothorax. 46 Reported pleurodesis rates range from 25% to 44% and even higher when combined with talc administration. 45,47\nOnly small case series are available for IPC use in patients with chylothorax or end-stage renal disease-related NMPEs; therefore, we cannot draw strong conclusions. Potechin and colleagues 48 reported the outcomes of 8 patients with end-stage renal disease-related pleural effusions treated with IPC and found that all patients experienced significant improvement in dyspnea with 37.5%, achieving pleurodesis allowing for\nsuccessful IPC removal. No cases of empyema or other serious complications were reported. Small retrospective case series describing the use of IPC for refractory chylothorax report pleurodesis rates up to 64% with no significant infectious or nutritional complications reported. 49,50 Because the use of IPCs for NMPEs may continue to increase over time, well-designed RCTs will be necessary to determine how suitable they are for long-term use in specific patient populations.",

      "title": "COMPLICATIONS",
      "content": "Despite all the highlighted benefits of IPCs, there are potential complications. The most common long-term complications include a nondraining catheter, tract metastasis, and infection, but each of these are relatively rare occurrences. Removal of an IPC in response to any complication occurs in fewer than 10% of patients. 25\nAnondraining catheter may be a sign of successful pleurodesis, but may also be related to catheter malfunction, an issue reported to occur in 5% to 14% of patients. 4 Evaluation of the pleural space with chest imaging as well as a review of patient symptoms is indicated when catheter drainage ceases, especially when it occurs suddenly. Catheter malfunction is likely in the presence of a persistent pleural effusion and respiratory symptoms. Occlusion of the IPC with a fibrin clot may occur and symptomatic pleural loculations may also develop. Flushing the IPC with saline is the recommended first step for treatment of catheter malfunction. If pleural fluid drainage does not improve after the saline flush, administration of intrapleural fibrinolytics may be indicated. Several studies have evaluated the use of intrapleural fibrinolytics via IPC for the treatment of symptomatic pleural loculations, with a variety of medications and dosages being reported. 4,51,52 Moststudies show fibrinolytic administration may be successful in improving IPC drainage after a dwell time of 60 to 120 minutes, but many patients will require repeat administration. 4 Alteplase is the most commonly reported fibrinolytic, usually at a dose of 2 to 10 mg. A recent consensus statement from Gilbert and colleagues recommends alteplase to reestablish IPC patency, whereas guidelines from Miller and colleagues do not recommend any particular fibrinolytic or dose. 4,14 Although reported to occur in less than 3% of patients with a nondraining catheter, bleeding is the most common complication of fibrinolysis and, therefore, individual bleeding risk must be considered before use. 4,51,52\nInfections, particularly empyema, are the most worrisome potential complications associated with IPC use. Cellulitis and exit site infections\noccur slightly more frequently, but pleural space infections are reported to occur in less than 5% of patients with an IPC for MPE. 4,7 The largest study evaluating clinical outcomes of patients with IPC-related pleural infections reported an associated mortality rate of 6%, suggesting that the outcomes are much better than previously reported. 53 Recent guidelines and expert panel recommendations for the management of IPC-related infectious complications are now available. 4,14 Specific recommendations depend on the individual process ( Table 1 ), but despite previous notions, removal of an IPC is often not required.\nCellulitis, exit site, and tunnel tract infections can usually be managed with outpatient antibiotics that adequately cover skin pathogens, although longer courses of treatment may be necessary for tunnel tract infections. When a pleural space infection is suspected, pleural fluid cultures should be obtained, although the ideal method for obtaining the fluid (via the catheter or a thoracentesis) has not been evaluated formally. Broad spectrum intravenous antibiotics, including consideration of anaerobic coverage, should be started while awaiting culture results. Continuous or increased frequency of pleural fluid drainage should also be\nData from Miller RJ, Chrissian AA, Lee YCG, et al.

If drainage is incomplete or significant loculations are present, intrapleural fibrinolytics and DNase are recommended in an attempt to prevent the need for lung decortication. There are several instances where the removal of an IPC and the placement of a chest tube may be necessary. These circumstances include concomitant tunnel tract and pleural space infection, poor pleural fluid drainage despite fibrinolytic administration, or a poor clinical response to aggressive treatment. 4,14 Historically, there have been concerns that patients actively treated with chemotherapy may be at increased risk of IPC-related infectious complications, but current evidence suggests otherwise. 4,54 There are currently no recommendations for prophylactic IPC removal before chemotherapy administration or to withhold placement in preparation for systemic treatment. 4\nTunnel tract metastasis is an uncommon occurrence seen in less than 5% of patients with an IPC ( Fig. 3 ). It is thought to occur from migration of tumor cells from the pleural space through the subcutaneous tissue and is most common in patients with mesothelioma. Diagnosis can be obtained with a percutaneous biopsy and treatment generally consists of localized radiation. 21",

      "content": "The breadth of knowledge regarding IPCs has increased substantially in the last decade. Available research has established that IPCs are effective at improving patient symptoms and\nminimizing hospitalization rates and lengths of stay, but are associated with a risk of potential complications. Fortunately, recent research has shown that the complication rates are relatively low, albeit not negligible. Pleurodesis rates achieved with IPCs are lower when compared with chemical or surgical pleurodesis, but IPCs are associated with a decreased need for repeat pleural procedures and similar quality of life.\nUnderstanding individual patient preferences and utilities is essential when determining optimal management for a recurrent, symptomatic pleural effusion and this information should influence treatment decisions. The future of MPE management likely lies in combined therapies, such as IPC plus a pleural sclerosant, at least in patients whose lung expands with drainage. This combination therapy may provide more optimal benefits than each individual procedure, although further research is needed. Effective pleurodesis and subsequent IPC removal is important, especially in regard to cost effectiveness and burden of catheter-related care, but future research should ideally focus on patient-centered outcomes. 15 Consistency of measurements between studies would also allow for a more direct comparison of results and add to the current body of knowledge.",
