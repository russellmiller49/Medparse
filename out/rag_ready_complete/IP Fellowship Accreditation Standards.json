IP focuses on the evaluation and management of thoracic diseases primarily involving the airways, lung parenchyma, and pleural space, while emphasizing minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Although IP techniques such as rigid bronchoscopy and pleuroscopy have been practiced for more than a century, the last 20 years have seen a rapid and marked growth in available IP techniques and equipment. During this same time, professional organizations in both North America and Europe have recognized the unique skill set germane to IP and have taken steps to further de /uniFB01 ne its indications, desired outcomes, and training requirements. 1,2 Survey data indicate that pulmonary procedures and the management of complex pleural and airway diseases are not uniformly emphasized in contemporary pulmonary medicine training 3,4 ; however, other studies con /uniFB01 rm that the knowledge and skill to practice IP are measurably enhanced by additional, concentrated training and mentorship beyond that offered within a standard pulmonary medicine curriculum. 5\nAs a result, there has been rapid growth of dedicated 12-month IP fellowship training programs intended to solidify advanced pulmonary procedural knowledge and skill and to prepare trainees to become leaders in pulmonary procedural practice, education, and research. In 2007, /uniFB01 ve dedicated IP fellowship programs existed; in the last 8 years, that number has grown to > 30 such programs in the United States and Canada. To help facilitate quality training, the Association of Interventional Pulmonology Program Directors (AIPPD) was established in 2010, and now the majority of IP fellowship programs select their trainees through the National Resident Matching Program. 6 Validated IP in-service and board certi /uniFB01 cation examinations also now exist, with > 180 interventional pulmonologists across the United States and Canada certi /uniFB01 ed by the American Association for Bronchology and Interventional Pulmonology (AABIP). 5 A survey of\ngraduates found that 89% of IP fellowship graduates work directly in IP, with most (75%) holding academic appointments. 7\nDespite practice guidelines outlining the desired objectives, structure, and curriculum of IP fellowship programs, there is still considerable variability between IP training programs, 8,9 and to date, there has been no recognized fellowship accreditation process. To address this situation, the AABIP and the AIPPD established the Joint Interventional Pulmonology Fellowship Accreditation Committee with the mandate to construct a uniform accreditation standard for IP fellowship programs in the United States. This standard has now been reviewed and edited and was approved in June 2016 by the AABIP and AIPPD as well as by the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST), the American Thoracic Society (ATS), and the Association of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine Program Directors (APCCMPD). It is published in full (e-Appendix 1, www.aabronchology. org, www.aippd.org), and the present article serves as an executive summary.\nIt is important to note that the accreditation standard as summarized here or in its full length is intended solely for the standardization of IP fellowship programs within the United States, with the intent to ensure that all IP fellowship training programs have the resources, expertise, facilities, curriculum, and caseload for adequate training. It is not intended to limit the current or future practice of pulmonologists who have not participated in IP fellowship training, nor is it intended to limit patient access to necessary procedures in the absence of a fellowship-trained interventional pulmonologist should those procedures be available through another competent provider. As such, the accreditation standard is intended to have no bearing on current or future reimbursement schedules for the procedures outlined, nor is it to be used in any way to limit reimbursement to physicians credentialed to perform those procedures even in the absence of formal IP fellowship training.",

      "content": "In 2014, the AABIP and AIPPD created a committee with the mandate to establish accreditation standards for IP fellowship programs in the United States. The initial framework of the accreditation document was constructed by using existing Accreditation Council for\nGraduate Medical Education (ACGME) accreditation standards for medicine subspecialty fellowships, anesthesia, and thoracic surgery. This also included but was not limited to examining educational standards, faculty/institution requirements, fellowship appointment, and evaluations. Deliberation and voting were conducted by using Delphi methods. The draft accreditation standard was reviewed and\nrevised by the CHEST, ATS, and APCCMPD; input was also received from the CHEST Training and Transitions Committee and the Interventional Chest/Diagnostic Procedures NetWork Steering\nCommittee. The /uniFB01 nal multisociety accreditation standard was approved in June 2016 by the AABIP, CHEST, AIPPD, APCCMPD, and ATS.",

The /uniFB01 nal document outlines the minimum requirements for accreditation of a fellowship program and is intended to ensure that all accredited programs have adequate resources, facilities, expertise, curriculum, and procedural volumes with which to train a fellow in IP. The standard, as a whole or in part, is not intended to ascribe any speci /uniFB01 c level of competence to the individual IP fellowship graduate or other practitioners but rather to ensure the existence of an environment in which competence can be achieved. The determination of competence to practice independently as an interventional pulmonologist remains the responsibility of the IP fellowship program director and faculty, IP board certi /uniFB01 cation process, and institutional credentialing committees. The following is a summary of program attributes needed to satisfy accreditation requirements. The attributes outlined here represent the consensus of all /uniFB01 ve contributing societies. The actual accreditation process and adjudication to include the decision to grant full accreditation, accreditation with warning, or withhold accreditation entirely will be the responsibility of the AABIP and AIPPD via a Joint Accreditation Committee.",

      "content": "The medical profession in the United States has the responsibility for self-regulation. Two primary mechanisms are used to ensure patient safety, as well as quality and uniformity of care. First, accreditation standards de /uniFB01 ne the training, skills, knowledge, and competencies speci /uniFB01 c to a medical specialty or subspecialty. Second, certi /uniFB01 cation boards administer independent assessments of individual practitioner knowledge and skill within that specialty or subspecialty. Since 2014, the AABIP has conducted an IP board certi /uniFB01 cation examination with a dual track eligibility process that permits both IP fellowship graduates and practicing interventional pulmonologists to qualify for the examination. Beginning in 2017, only IP fellowship graduates will be eligible for board certi /uniFB01 cation, with an estimated 30 to 40 new matriculates per year depending on the number of accredited fellowships.\nEven as the number of IP fellowships grows each year, a uniform accreditation standard outlining the required curriculum and fellowship environment has not existed. This document summarizes just such a standard with the full accreditation standard available online at the AABIP and AIPPD websites and in e-Appendix 1 and e-Table. The standard has been constructed by using existing literature and guidelines and through a formal process with representation from the major professional organizations representing IP and pulmonary medicine in the United States. The intent of this multiyear and multisociety endeavor is to more speci /uniFB01 cally de /uniFB01 ne the training of IP practitioners in the United States and thereby better assure quality of care and standardization of the IP skill set. A formal accreditation process will further safeguard the expectations of fellowship applicants, patients, and potential employers.\nIt should be clearly stated that the goal of this accreditation standard was not to exclude fellowship programs but to raise the quality of all programs to a common level of excellence, and it is the stated intent of the AABIP and AIPPD to make every effort to assist programs in their pursuit of accreditation. Furthermore, because IP is an evolving subspecialty of pulmonary medicine, there remain many pulmonary practitioners who perform various procedures and techniques outlined in this standard as core IP procedures.

      "content": "This accreditation standard is the product of a joint multisociety effort. The document and standard itself will, by design, evolve as the practice of IP evolves. Any additions, deletions, or edits to the current accreditation standard will likewise be the action of a joint multisociety effort. The actual process of accreditation, however, will remain the responsibility of the AABIP and AIPPD via the assessments and recommendations of a Joint Fellowship Accreditation Committee.\nThere are still challenges facing this /uniFB01 eld, which is in its infancy. Within academic circles, it is unclear how practitioners of IP hired with the expectation of carrying a heavy clinical load can advance in the traditional academic setting. Furthermore, because IP training programs are structured largely based on providing fellows with a clinical exposure and limited dedicated research time, it is unclear how they will develop the research skills to elevate the profession and prepare a portion of those interested in pursuing an academic career. Some programs have already recognized this concern and have instituted a second year of fellowship training to incorporate a more robust research exposure into the IP fellowship.\nPriority must be given to research regarding competency to perform the procedures germane to this /uniFB01 eld. Traditional metrics such as individual procedural volume have largely been opinion-based and do not account for the intangibles such as an understanding of the indications, contraindications, risks and bene /uniFB01 ts to the patient, and alternative treatment options. In addition, there is variation in learners ' psychomotor coordination such that reaching a target volume for some will not ensure competency while others may master that same procedure much more ef /uniFB01 ciently. Finally, how new procedures will be introduced into the /uniFB01 eld has largely been a haphazard exercise. New technologies may be costly, can incur patient risk, and at times do not contribute meaningfully to patient care. IP practitioners must take a leadership role in the evaluation of new technologies and the incorporation of new technology, when appropriate, into the pulmonary practitioner ' s armamentarium.\nHowever, standardizing fellowship training requirements so that there is uniform training in IP is an important /uniFB01 rst step in the continuing evolution of this specialty within a specialty. This document should be considered a starting point that will evolve over time and result in better training for practitioners and better care for the patients.",
