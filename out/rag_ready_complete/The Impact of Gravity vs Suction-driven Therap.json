      "content": "Between October 11, 2018, and April 5, 2019, a total of 201 patients were screened and 142 were randomized to undergo thoracentesis with gravity or suction drainage (Fig 1). Two subjects in the gravity group were withdrawn by investigators before any pleural /uniFB02 uid was removed or outcome data obtained; one was withdrawn for discovery of a non-free/uniFB02 owing effusion requiring an alternative procedure and the other\nbecause equipment to perform the study procedure was unavailable. The /uniFB01 nal analysis included 62 patients who underwent gravity drainage and 78 who underwent aspiration via suction. This imbalance resulted from 10 sites enrolling simultaneously from distinct permuted block randomization schedules. Once the recruitment target was met, all sites immediately stopped enrolling; this imbalance represents a swing of eight allocations across all sites.\nPatients assigned to each group were well matched on baseline characteristics (Table 1). Average chest discomfort on the day of the procedure did not differ between groups (mean difference in VAS scores, 3.9 mm; 95% CI, -5.6 to 13.5). Current chest discomfort immediately prior to procedure start differed between groups (suction VAS score, 22.9 /C6 25.0 mm; gravity VAS score, 12.3 /C6 18.1 mm).\nThe primary outcome of overall procedural chest discomfort measured by VAS 5 min postprocedure did not differ between the suction and gravity groups (mean difference in VAS scores, 5.3 mm; 95% CI, -2.4 to 13.0; P ¼ .17) (Fig 2, Table 2). Likewise, there was no difference between the suction and gravity groups for any patient-reported secondary outcome, including intraprocedure or postprocedure VAS discomfort scores (Fig 3), postprocedure VAS and Borg dyspnea scores (Fig 4, Table 3), or pre-to-post procedure differences in VAS discomfort and dyspnea scores. Two post hoc analyses of the primary outcome were performed: one adjusting for current chest discomfort preprocedure and the other a per-protocol analysis excluding 11 suction procedures performed with continuous wall suction instead of protocoldictated manual syringe aspiration. These analyses also found no difference between suction and gravity groups (e-Figs 1-3, e-Tables 2-3).\nPrimary and secondary outcomes were similar when the Wilcoxon rank sum test was used (e-Table 4). More than 1,500 mL was drained in 31 procedures (17 gravity, 14 suction) with no difference between groups on any outcome measures within this subset, and no complications occurred in these patients.\nThe volume of /uniFB02 uid drained in each group was equivalent (mean, 1,264 /C6 724 mL suction vs 1,165 /C6\nData are presented as mean /C6 SD unless otherwise indicated. a\nb Other known effusion etiologies preprocedure: nonspeci /uniFB01 c pleuritis according to results of previous pleural biopsy (2), postcardiac surgery (1), and drug induced (1).\n543 mL gravity; mean difference, 99 mL; 95% CI, -113 to 310; P ¼ .89).

In both groups, drainage stopped spontaneously in approximately\none-half of procedures; the other one-half were stopped early for chest discomfort, and a small minority were stopped for other reasons. Postprocedure ultrasound revealed more than scant residual pleural /uniFB02 uid in approximately one-half of patients in each arm, with similar reasons for drainage discontinuation between groups (e-Table 5).\nNo signi /uniFB01 cant adverse events were observed. One pneumothorax was documented on a postprocedure chest radiograph in the suction group, with approximately 2 mm of apical pleural separation. During this procedure, a small amount of air was noted to be entrained via the thoracentesis catheter while attaching the drainage apparatus, and the pneumothorax had resolved several hours later. There were no instances of pneumothorax ex vacuo, expanding pneumothorax, REPE, or bleeding complication.",

In both groups, chest discomfort increased during the procedure then returned to preprocedure baseline approximately 24 h later (Fig 3), and breathlessness continued to improve through 48 h postprocedure (Fig 4). The only signi /uniFB01 cant difference between groups was the time required to drain equivalent volumes of /uniFB02 uid, with gravity drainage requiring a mean additional 7.4 min. There were no signi /uniFB01 cant\ncomplications in either group. Both methods of pleural /uniFB02 uid drainage seemed safe and resulted in comparable levels of procedural comfort and improvement in dyspnea, with active aspiration requiring less overall time.\nMajor complications of therapeutic thoracentesis, including chest discomfort, pneumothorax ex vacuo, and REPE, have been associated with increasingly negative pleural pressures, occurring when /uniFB02 uid is excessively aspirated in the setting of nonexpandable lung. 3,6-10 The presence of nonexpandable lung, with a prevalence of 40% in a recent similar trial, 13 is dif /uniFB01 cult to predict prior to therapeutic thoracentesis. Recent work has focused on whether direct monitoring of pleural pressures via manometry might prevent pressure-related complications. This recent randomized trial found that routine use of a digital pleural manometer during therapeutic thoracentesis conferred no bene /uniFB01 t. 13 The current study sought to evaluate whether changing the degree of negative pressure applied to the pleural space during therapeutic thoracentesis would improve patient comfort.\nDespite the frequency with which thoracentesis is performed, and the association between pleural pressure and complications, optimal drainage methods have not been extensively studied. As a result, there is signi /uniFB01 cant variation in drainage techniques, with intermittent suction via manual syringe aspiration, continuous suction via vacuum bottle or wall-based suction, and drainage to gravity all considered standard-of-care. These methods all apply negative pressure to the pleural space but to different and often variable magnitudes. Kelil et al 24 measured ex vivo pressures generated by evacuated bottle, 60-mL Luer Lock syringe, and wall suction with the regulator turned to maximal continuous suction. Maximum negative pressures measured were -963 cm H2O, -802 cm H2O, and -706 cm H2O, respectively. Alraiyes et al 25 measured negative pressures during therapeutic thoracentesis using digital manometers positioned in-line between the thoracentesis catheter and drainage line; they noted maximal negative pressures of approximately -250 cm H2O aspirating with a 60-mL syringe and -115 cm H2O with an evacuated bottle. The gravity drainage method used in this study generated constant negative pressure of approximately -17 cm H2O, signi /uniFB01 cantly lower than all active-suction pleural /uniFB02 uid aspiration methods (e-Figs 4-5).\nNo previous studies have compared pleural /uniFB02 uid drainage by gravity vs active aspiration. Senitko et al 4 randomized 100 patients to undergo drainage by manual\nTime Point\nsyringe aspiration or evacuated bottle and found more complications in the latter group, although some questioned whether this study was adequately powered. Sagar et al, 26 in a brief letter, reported a complication rate of 0.012% using maximal wall suction to aspirate pleural /uniFB02 uid. Kim et al 27 reported no increase in complication rates following the switch from evacuated container to wall suction in a prospective observational series involving 421 thoracenteses; objective chest discomfort measurements were not reported, however.\nWe hypothesized that gravity drainage would result in less chest discomfort. One criticism of intermittent\npleural manometry-guided thoracentesis is the signi /uniFB01 cant ' blind time ' between pleural pressure measurements, when highly negative pressures might be generated by active aspiration methods if the lung reaches its limit of normal expandability between measurements. 13,28 Excessively negative intrapleural pressures might be avoided by an aspiration mechanism that does not use a degree of suction in the excessively negative range. However, our /uniFB01 ndings suggest that this strategy does not protect against chest discomfort. There are several potential explanations for this /uniFB01 nding. Although gravity drainage involves a signi /uniFB01 cantly lower degree of suction, it still applies negative pressure to the\nData are presented as mean /C6 SD. VAS ¼ 0-100 mm. See Table 2 legend for expansion of abbreviation.\na Suction minus gravity.\nb On the day of the procedure.\n]\npleural space, and despite the studied gravity apparatus exerting negative pressure ex vivo below the threshold of ' excessively negative, ' excessively negative pleural pressure could still develop in the breathing patient with nonexpandable lung due to swings in pleural pressure with respiration. In addition, the relation between intrapleural pressure and chest discomfort is inconsistent. In a large prospective series, FellerKopman et al 7 noted that only 22% of patients who developed chest discomfort had excessively negative pleural pressure, and 9% of patients with excessively\nnegative intrapleural pressure had no symptoms. Others have noted the development of pneumothorax ex vacuo despite use of pleural manometry with avoidance of excessively negative pleural pressure. 21,29 Heidecker et al 21 suggested that local nonuniform stresses exerted on the visceral pleura, rather than global pressure within the pleural space, might explain these /uniFB01 ndings.\nOf paramount importance in considering a randomized trial in which no difference was found between groups is whether a type II error has occurred. This trial was appropriately powered using a superiority design to detect a clinically meaningful difference in VAS discomfort score, with planned enrollment of at least 64 patients in each arm. Variability of the primary outcome did not exceed variability assumed for the power calculation (actual overall SD of 22.9 vs assumed SD of 30). We did note an imbalance in allocation away from the planned 1:1 ratio due to 10 sites enrolling simultaneously from distinct permuted block randomization schedules. Repeat power calculation using the /uniFB01 nal allocation numbers con /uniFB01 rms that this trial remains appropriately powered (power of 83%). There were very few postrandomization exclusions, and complete outcomes data were available on all patients. Among 201 screened patients, only 47 (23%) were excluded prior to randomization, the majority of which (37 of 47) for effusions that were too small according to objective radiographic criteria, supporting the external validity of our /uniFB01 ndings.\nBaseline characteristics were similar between groups, except for lower immediate preprocedure chest\nb Other etiologies included (n ¼ 1 each): trapped lung with ex vacuo transudative effusion, multifactorial volume overload, drug-induced (dasatinib), and paramalignant in /uniFB02 ammatory.\nData are presented as mean /C6 SD unless otherwise indicated.\na Suction minus gravity.\nb More than scant residual pleural /uniFB02 uid on postprocedure thoracic ultrasound.\ndiscomfort in the gravity group. If gravity drainage was more comfortable within the prede /uniFB01 ned time points, as hypothesized, we should have seen lower chest discomfort scores on the primary outcome after starting at a lower baseline level of discomfort, and post hoc analysis adjusting for immediate pre-procedure chest discomfort concurred with the primary analysis. Furthermore, all secondary outcomes related to discomfort, including pre-to-post change in discomfort, failed to identify a difference between groups. Eleven thoracenteses allocated to suction were accomplished with continuous wall suction rather than protocoldirected manual syringe aspiration. Both methods have been shown to produce comparable levels of negative pressure as reviewed earlier, with one study associating continuous suction with more discomfort and a higher incidence of other complications. 4 If true, this scenario should also have biased toward /uniFB01 nding a difference between these groups, which we did not, and post hoc per-protocol analysis excluding wall suction cases concurred with the primary analysis. Thus, we are con /uniFB01 dent on the basis of the data integrity that this study represents a true negative for the primary outcome analysis.\nThis study has several limitations. It was not powered to detect differences in REPE or pneumothorax ex vacuo, which would require prohibitively large sample sizes. Manometry was not used during thoracenteses in this trial, and thus the precise negative pressures being applied in vivo by the two studied methods is not known; however, based on\nprevious data, this has not been shown to affect symptomatic outcomes and thus was deemed an unnecessary measurement. The most pertinent intraprocedure pressure measurement would be the pressure within the pleural space measured via independent catheter or channel from the drainage catheter, which was not practically feasible. It is possible that the postprocedure time points selected for discomfort measurements did not fully capture the degree of procedural discomfort experienced, although our data with highest discomfort just prior to catheter removal with a downward trend in discomfort scores thereafter suggest we are not missing a later peak in discomfort.",

      "content": "We conclude that pleural /uniFB02 uid drainage via suction and gravity drainage are equivalent in terms of patient comfort, with both methods increasing discomfort and relieving dyspnea by comparable magnitudes. Both also appear safe, with no signi /uniFB01 cant complications occurring in this trial. Gravity drainage did require additional time to accomplish drainage, although proponents of gravity drainage note that this is ' hands-off ' time that some /uniFB01 nd more convenient. These two aspiration methods, one faster but ' handson ' and the other slower but more ' hands-off, ' can be used interchangeably by individual providers according to their personal preferences and the clinical setting.\n]",
