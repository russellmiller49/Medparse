    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is debate regarding the ideal instrument for medical thoracoscopy. The authors compared rigid mini-thoracoscopy with semirigid thoracoscopy for thoracoscopic pleural biopsy. METHODS: Consecutive subjects with undiagnosed exudative pleural effusion were randomized (1:1 ratio) to mini-thoracoscopy or semirigid thoracoscopy groups. The primary objective was a comparison of the diagnostic yield of pleural biopsy. Key secondary outcomes were the comparison of sedative/analgesic dose, operator-rated and patient-rated pain on visual analog scale (VAS), operator-rated overall procedural satisfaction (VAS), pleural biopsy size, and complications between the groups. RESULTS: Of the 88 screened subjects, 73 were randomized: 36 to mini-thoracoscopy and 37 to semirigid thoracoscopy. Diagnostic yield of pleural biopsy in the mini-thoracoscopy (69.4%) and semirigid thoracoscopy groups (81.1%) was similar on intention-to-treat analysis (P=0.25). Although the operator-rated overall procedure satisfaction scores were similar between groups (P=0.87), operator-rated pain [VAS (mean±SD), 43.5±16.7 vs. 31.7±15.8; P<0.001] and patient-rated pain (VAS, 41.9±17.3 vs. 32.1±16.5; P=0.02) scores were greater in the mini-thoracoscopy group. Mean dose of fentanyl and midazolam received was similar between the 2 groups (P=0.28 and 0.68, respectively). Biopsy size was larger in the mini-thoracoscopy group (16.1±4.5 vs. 8.3±2.9 mm; P<0.001). Three minor complications occurred in the mini-thoracoscopy group and 6 in the semirigid thoracoscopy group (P=0.11). There were no serious adverse events or procedure-related mortality. CONCLUSION: Diagnostic yield of rigid mini-thoracoscopy is not superior to semirigid thoracoscopy. Use of semirigid thoracoscope may provide greater patient comfort.",

The most common etiologies are malignancy and tuberculosis (TB). 1 It is dif/uniFB01 cult to differentiate tuberculous and malignant pleural effusions on a clinicoradiologic pro /uniFB01 le. The diagnostic yield from thoracentesis and/or closed pleural biopsy is suboptimal, leaving ~25% to 40% of these patients undiagnosed. 2,3 Medical thoracoscopy or pleuroscopy is the preferred modality for the evaluation of undiagnosed exudative pleural effusions as it allows pleural visualization and pleural biopsy under direct visualization and has excellent diagnostic yield. 4\nThere is debate regarding the ideal instrument for performing thoracoscopy. 5 The most commonly used is the conventional rigid thoracoscope (10-mm external diameter with a 5-mm working channel), though this may be an unfamiliar tool for many pulmonologists. 6 Asemirigid/ /uniFB02 exi-rigid thoracoscope (Olympus LTF-160; 7.0-mm outer diameter with 2.8-mm working channel) is also available that is similar in design to a /uniFB02 exible videobronchoscope. 7 The utility of a semirigid thoracoscope has been previously reported. 8,9\nReceived for publication April 11, 2019; accepted July 29, 2019.\nFrom the Departments of *Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine; † Pathology; ‡ Medical Oncology; and §Biostatistics, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India.\nS.B.: collected data, data analysis, prepared the manuscript.

All rights reserved. DOI: 10.1097/LBR.0000000000000620\nTwo previous RCTs have compared the diagnostic yield of conventional rigid thoracoscope versus the semirigid thoracoscope and found that the diagnostic yield of both the instruments is similar if an adequate pleural biopsy is obtained. 5,10 However, there is a concern that the use of a semirigid thoracoscope may be associated with a greater incidence of inability to obtain an adequate pleural biopsy. 10 The potential advantage of rigid thoracoscope to obtain an adequate pleural biopsy more consistently is offset by greater procedurerelated pain and higher requirement of sedation/ analgesia with its use. Therefore, each instrument has its advantages and limitations.\nMini-thoracoscope (Richard Wolf GmbH, Germany) is a relatively newer rigid thoracoscopy instrument that has an external diameter smaller (5.5 mm) than the conventional rigid and semirigid thoracoscopes and a working channel (3.5 mm) larger than the semirigid thoracoscope. However, there is scant literature available on its diagnostic yield and no previous study has compared its performance characteristics with the semirigid thoracoscope. We performed a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare the diagnostic yield of mini-thoracoscopy with semirigid thoracoscopy in patients presenting with undiagnosed pleural effusion.",

      "content": "Baseline investigations included complete blood count, liver and renal function tests, coagulation pro /uniFB01 le, an electrocardiogram, and computed tomography scan of the thorax in all subjects. Diagnostic thoracentesis results (including pleural /uniFB02 uid analysis for pH, total and differential cell count, protein, glucose, adenosine deaminase, acid-fast stain, Gram stain and bacterial cultures, and 3 pleural /uniFB02 uid cytology examinations) were available before the enrollment in the study. Pleural effusion was classi /uniFB01 ed as exudative according to Light ' s criteria. Three operators performed the procedures in both the groups. The use of semirigid thoracoscope was more common at the center before initiation of the study.\nFor performing procedures in the semirigid thoracoscopy group, the autoclavable semirigid thoracoscope LTF-160 (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), was used. For entry port, a 10-mm diameter plastic trocar was used. Flexible forceps (2.8 mm) with alligator jaw and spike was used for pleural biopsy in this group. In the minithoracoscopy group, the rigid mini-thoracoscope (Richard Wolf GmbH, Germany) was utilized. It is a 5.5-mm diameter operating metallic laparoendoscope with a 3.5-mm internal working channel. The direction of view is 0 degrees and a 3.5-mm rigid biopsy forceps with spoon jaws was\nused for pleural biopsy. For entry port, a 5.5-mm diameter metallic trocar was used.\nBefore thoracoscopy, nil per oral status was ensured. The subject was positioned in the lateral decubitus position with the procedure side up. Clinical examination and thoracic ultrasound were performed in all to evaluate the rib spaces, amount of pleural /uniFB02 uid and for selection of the thoracoscope port site. Hemodynamic monitoring included monitoring of vital parameters: blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. Supplemental oxygen was administered to maintain oxygen saturation > 90% during the procedure. Procedures were performed under moderate conscious sedation using a combination of intravenous benzodiazepine (midazolam) and opioid (fentanyl). The initial doses of midazolam and fentanyl administered were 0.015 mg/kg and 1.5 µ g/kg, respectively. Doses were escalated targeting a sedation level where the patient was sedated and verbal contact was possible at all times. A sedation scale was not used. The procedure site was exposed and prepared using chlorhexidine and 10% povidone iodine. The skin, subcutaneous tissue, and parietal pleura were anesthetized using in /uniFB01 ltration with 1% lignocaine solution (10 mg/ mL), at the incision site. An incision was subsequently made at the preselected site. Blunt dissection was performed and after pleural puncture, trocar was introduced. Preparation steps were similar in both groups. After port creation, the thoracoscope was then inserted through the trocar. Pleural /uniFB02 uid was aspirated and a systematic examination of the pleural surfaces was performed. Minimum of 6 to 8 pleural biopsy samples were obtained with semirigid thoracoscope (owing to the smaller size of biopsies with /uniFB02 exible forceps) and at least 4 with minithoracoscopy. Switching to alternative thoracoscope was performed in case of dif /uniFB01 culty/inability in obtaining pleural biopsy with 1 instrument. Histopathologic examination, mycobacterial cultures, and Xpert MTB-Rif test were performed on all pleural biopsy specimens. Upon procedure completion, a chest drain was inserted. A chest radiograph was obtained in all subjects following the procedure. Subjects were followed-up to 6 months in case a de /uniFB01 nite diagnosis was not obtained on pleural biopsy.",

Fifteen were excluded (6 had minimal effusion on thoracic ultrasound and 9 had extensive rib crowding on clinical examination) and /uniFB01 nally, 73 subjects were randomized: 36 to mini-thoracoscopy group and 37 to semirigid thoracoscopy group. Two subjects from minithoracoscopy group were crossed over to\nsemirigid thoracoscopy because the presence of thick adhesions and dif /uniFB01 culty in scope maneuverability with mini-thoracoscope necessitated an attempt with the semirigid thoracoscope. In 2 subjects (one from each group), the procedure was abandoned because of limited pleural access because of dense adhesions. The /uniFB02 ow of subjects in the study is shown in the CONSORT diagram (Fig. 1). Baseline clinical characteristics were comparable (Table 1). The mean age of the overall cohort was 50.1 ± 13.9 years. There was no difference between symptoms, duration of symptoms, smoking status, preprocedure clinicoradiologic diagnosis, and comorbidities between the groups. Hypertension and diabetes mellitus were the most common comorbid conditions. Most of the pleural effusions were moderate to large sized. The proportion of patients with the presence of pleural thickening, pleural nodularity, or pleural loculations on thoracic computed tomography scan was similar between the groups. The pleural /uniFB02 uid characteristics were also similar between the groups. The proportion of inconclusive/suspicious cytologic /uniFB01 ndings for\nmalignancy on pleural /uniFB02 uid examination was similar between the groups.\nThe proportion of procedures performed by trainee fellows and a specialist consultant was not different between the 2 groups ( P = 0.69). The procedural dose of lignocaine and the incision size was similar in both the arms. On thoracoscopic visualization, abnormal /uniFB01 ndings were found in 65 of 73 subjects (89.0%). Normal/shiny pleura was seen in 5 (13.89%) and 3 (8.11%) subjects in the mini-rigid thoracoscopy group and semirigid thoracoscopy group, respectively. The distribution of various /uniFB01 ndings observed during thoracoscopy has been summarized in Table 2. There was a signi /uniFB01 cant difference between the size of nodules between the 2 groups ( P = 0.03) and small nodules were present in more subjects in the semirigid thoracoscopy group.\nThe study outcomes are summarized in Table 3. On intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, the diagnostic yield of pleural biopsy was 69.4% in mini-rigid thoracoscopy arm and 81.1% in semirigid thoracoscopy arm ( P = 0.25). Adequate biopsies were obtained in all subjects in both groups.\nOn ' as-treated ' analysis (analyzing the number of subjects who underwent the actual procedure as per the group analyzed), the diagnostic yield was 75.6% and 84.2% in the mini-thoracoscopy and semirigid thoracoscopy groups, respectively ( P = 0.30) and was similar between the groups. Overall, a de /uniFB01 nitive histopathologic diagnosis (either malignancy or TB) was achieved in 48 of 71 subjects (67.6%). Malignancy was found in 37 subjects (52.1%) and TB was diagnosed in 11 subjects (18.2%). NSP was found in 21 (29.6%) and normal pleura were diagnosed in 2 (2.8%) subjects. Adenocarcinoma was the most common primary malignant etiology (28/37) (75.7%). Subjects with nondiagnostic pleural biopsy (n = 23) were followed-up for 6 months. On follow-up, 9 pleural biopsies were found to be diagnostic. Patients who were lost to followup/expired pending a /uniFB01 nal diagnosis or an\nalternative diagnosis were analyzed as a nondiagnostic pleural biopsy.\nThe dose of midazolam and fentanyl used was comparable between the 2 groups (Table 3). Biopsy size was signi /uniFB01 cantly larger in the minithoracoscopy group (16.1± 4.5 mm) as compared with the semirigid group (8.3 ± 2.9 mm) ( P < 0.001). Operator and patient-rated pain during the procedure (VAS), and operator-rated pain during scope manipulation (VAS) was signi /uniFB01 cantly greater in the mini-thoracoscopy group. The ease of maneuverability was better with semirigid thoracoscope ( P = 0.003). The ease of taking biopsy, quality of image, and the expectation that the biopsy will yield histologic diagnosis was similar in both the groups. There were no major complications during the study and no procedure-related death. Nine minor complications occurred -3 in mini-thoracoscopy arm and 6",

Therefore, the results may not be generalizable to populations or settings with a higher incidence of malignant mesothelioma. In such situations, there may be a difference in the yield of 2 instruments and a larger RCT may bring more clarity in this regard.

However, this is unlikely to be signi /uniFB01 cant as the proportion of procedures performed by a fellow or consultant were similar between the groups. No conclusion can be drawn regarding the comparative characteristics of the 2 instruments for advanced thoracoscopy procedures like adhesiolysis as this was not the primary aim of this study. 12 Although successful performance of adhesiolysis has been reported with a semirigid thoracoscope, the rigid thoracoscope is an intuitive choice in this regard.\nMalignancy was the most common etiology in our study and the most common histopathologic diagnosis was adenocarcinoma lung that was consistent with the previous studies. 13,14 The incidence of TB was lower (18% vs. 25%) than the other studies from similar settings. 10 This is likely a referral bias as ours is a tertiary care referral institute. Subjects with clinically suspected tubercular pleural effusion are often started on empirical ATT, may improve subsequently and are less likely to present to a tertiary care facility.\nAn observation in our study was the need for conversion of procedure from rigid to the semirigid instrument in 2 subjects. This was required because of presence of thick adhesions wherein excessive manipulation with the rigid instrument was considered risky. The procedure could be performed successfully after conversion to a semirigid thoracoscope and the observed advantage included better image and angulation capability because of /uniFB02 exibility at the tip. This is contrary to the observation in a previous RCT wherein 7 procedures were converted from semirigid to rigid thoracoscopy because of dense adhesions. 10 The angulation capability of the semirigid thoracoscope is especially important as it also prevents injury to the ribs and decreases procedurerelated pain. Pain during scope manipulation was also signi /uniFB01 cantly lower in the semirigid group. The overall maneuverability as assessed by VAS score was also easier with the semirigid thoracoscope. However, the possibility of bias cannot be excluded entirely in the interpretation of these observed bene/uniFB01 ts with the semirigid thoracoscope as the operators were not blinded for pain and procedure satisfaction assessments. Incision size was also observed to be larger in the mini-thoracoscopy group (though statistically nonsigni /uniFB01 cant). Despite biopsy size being smaller, semirigid thoracoscopy was able to provide diagnostic yield in most of the patients. This agrees with the previous studies. 5,8 -10 The choice of instrument may eventually depend upon the operator and\nthe prevalence characteristics of mesothelioma in the population. In case of the high prevalence of mesothelioma in the population, rigid thoracoscopy may be preferred owing to its ability to take deeper pleural biopsies. Operator experience is important regardless of the instrument used to ensure the correct sites for obtaining pleural biopsy while performing thoracoscopy. The overall yield of thoracoscopy was lower in our study than the previous RCTs. 5,10 A greater number of subjects who had NSP were considered as diagnostic pleural biopsy in a previous study and loss to follow-up or any mortality during the study were not reported. 10 These are possible reasons for a lower overall diagnostic yield of thoracoscopy in our study. The observed difference in the lower biopsy yield in our study as compared with other studies may be attributed to smaller sample size. In our study, subjects who expired without a diagnosis or lost to follow-up or subjects who improved on empirical treatment were considered nondiagnostic.\nThis is the /uniFB01 rst RCT comparing the minithoracoscope with the semirigid thoracoscope for pleural biopsy in undiagnosed pleural effusions. The strength of the study was the rigorous follow-up. Second, an aggressive effort was made to establish the diagnosis in subjects with NSP. We did not /uniFB01 nd a superiority of rigid mini-thoracoscopy over semirigid thoracoscopy for performing a thoracoscopic pleural biopsy in undiagnosed exudative pleural effusions.",
