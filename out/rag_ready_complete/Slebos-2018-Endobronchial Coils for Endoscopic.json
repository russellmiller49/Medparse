      "title": "Introduction",
      "content": "Endoscopic lung volume reduction is a realistic treatment option for selected patients with severe emphysema [1,  2].  Different  endoscopic  lung  volume  reduction  approaches have been developed to accommodate the different emphysema phenotypes, with both endobronchial oneway valve treatment and endobronchial coil treatment being the most intensively investigated [3-6]. These therapies are also recognised in the recent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) GOLD recommendations [7]. The endobronchial coils are 'non-blocking' devices which are delivered by bronchoscopy into the sub-segmental airways. Unlike one-way endobronchial valves, the endobronchial coils are also effective in patients with interlobar collateral ventilation and, thus, work independent of this phenomenon. Furthermore, endobronchial coils do not induce lobar atelectasis and, hence, cause minimal reduction on the gas exchange area of the treated lobe. The coils are made from shape memory nitinol (a nickel-titanium alloy) wire (Fig. 1). About 10-14 coils are placed at each treatment under fluoroscopic guidance, with the objective of treating 2 contralateral lobes in 2 separate procedures, with the contralateral lobe being treated 4-8 weeks later. The procedure is preferably performed under general anaesthesia, and the patients are hospitalized for at least 1 night for observation after the procedure. However, this can vary widely with local practice. This article provides detailed guidance by an international panel of experts experienced in this therapy regarding patient selection, peri-procedural care and technical guidance on performing the procedure. We have also addressed the management of procedural complications.",

      "title": "Mechanisms of Action",
      "content": "Understanding the mechanisms of action is important, as this may facilitate better patient selection, enable optimization of the implantation technique and drive the de-\nvelopment of new coils, perhaps even adjusted to the individual needs and characteristics of a patient. Differing views exist, and one possibility is that the nitinol wires, following  deployment,  return  to  their  predetermined shape, distorting the airways and thereby compressing the diseased tissue and achieving re-tensioning of the diseased airway network to decrease air-trapping and hyperinflation. Additionally, improved elastic recoil and hyperinflation are thought to improve diaphragm and inspiratory muscle function [18]. Finally, well-placed coils may theoretically improve elastic recoil forces locally and, thus, reduce overall inhomogeneity of ventilation. Unfortunately, no study has so far systematically investigated these different  mechanisms  of  action.  One  computed  tomography\n(CT) scan study measured in- and expiratory lobe volumes and luminal areas of segmental bronchi, before and after coil treatment, in 30 severe emphysema patients [19]. In the treated segmental bronchia, the cross-sectional lumen decreased significantly during inspiration and tended to increase during expiration. Volumes of the treated segments correlated with the treated segmental bronchial lumina in expiration ( r = 0.80, p < 0.001). The authors suggest that the data of the study are in support of the current understanding of coil effects, which claim that they stabilise and stiffen the lung parenchyma, thus compensating for the loss of elasticity in the lung interstitium and consequently reducing bronchial motility and collapsing. A further study by Palamidas et al. [20] evaluated lobar volumes in a randomised controlled study. Target lobar volumes were decreased, and compensatory hyperinflation\nof  the  untreated  ipsilateral  lobes  was  observed.  Hence, there  was  no  dramatic  reduction  in  total  lung  capacity (TLC). There were strong correlations between reduction in volumes of the treated lobes and changes in pulmonary function. The greatest effects appeared to occur in patients who  developed  inflammatory  coil-associated  opacities. This inflammatory process itself induces localised fibrosis and, hence, volume reduction with improvements in pulmonary function.",

Severe panlobular emphysema, giant bullae and paraseptal emphysema are morphological patterns of emphysema that are not suitable for treatment with endobronchial coils. Computerised quantitative CT analysis using densitometry  should  be  utilised  to  more  accurately  assess  the amount of parenchymal destruction and guide optimal selection of the treatment site. Potential sites of treatment are where there is lobar destruction of 20-80% at the -950 HU threshold on a low (or 'soft') kernel reconstructed thin-slice (1 mm) high-resolution CT. The lobes with the greatest degree of destruction should be targeted. Endobronchial coils can be used independent of collateral ven-\ntilation, and, hence, fissure integrity is not a crucial assessment. However, the authors recommend a more holistic approach  when  assessing patients  and  would recommend a full evaluation followed by a multi-disciplinary discussion to ensure that the patient receives the best treatment option for their individual situation [4]. Furthermore, emphysema patients with both a homogeneous or heterogeneous emphysema distribution can be treated. Similarly, both upper lobe or lower lobe emphysema may be treated.",

      "title": "Coil Placement",
      "content": "The lung volume reduction coil placement is preferably performed under general anaesthesia, and the patients are generally hospitalized for 1 night of observation following  the  procedure  (this  can  vary  widely  with  local practice,  however).  The  coil  procedure  is  a  sequential treatment, with 1 lobe treated initially and the target lobe in the contralateral lung treated 4-8 weeks later. About 10-14 coils are placed in the target lobes under fluoroscopy (Fig. 2). The procedure is performed under fluoroscopic guidance.\nFirst, the flexible guidewire, which has an atraumatic tip that serves as a guide for the delivery catheter, is used to  identify  suitable  airways  for  treatment.  It  has  radio opaque markers that correspond to the 3 different coil sizes  and  facilitate  the  choice  of  the  appropriate  coil length. The guidewire and catheter are inserted together into the instrument channel of the bronchoscope. The bronchoscope is advanced to the ostium of one of the sub-segmental airways in the treatment lobe (Fig. 3a). Afterwards, the guidewire is advanced into one of the sub-segmental airways and advanced as far as the pleura. This allows estimation of the target airway length. The wire is then withdrawn back from the pleural edge until a safe distance is guaranteed (best 25-40 mm). The catheter  is  then  gently  advanced  over  the  guidewire,  again under fluoroscopy. In the majority of patients, it is only necessary to advance the catheter over the guidewire un-\ntil  just  over one visible marker (Fig. 3b). This distance comfortably allows the placement of a 125-mm length coil and ensures that wherever possible the coil is placed in  the  mid  third  of  the  lung  and  not  in  the  periphery (Fig. 4). The catheter should not be advanced against resistance. Once the catheter has been advanced to the desired  position,  the  guidewire  is  withdrawn  until  it  is aligned with the catheter to measure the optimal coil size. The guidewire can then be withdrawn and the fluoroscopy switched off.\nAfter loading the cartridge with the right sized coil, the cartridge is coupled with the catheter. The forceps and coil  are  then  advanced  through  the  catheter.  A  guide mark on the catheter advises the operator when the coil is approaching the distal end of the catheter, and the fluoroscopy should be recommenced at this stage. The coil is advanced until the ball and the first half loop of the coil are protruding from the catheter. This allows the coil to be anchored into position, and then the coil is deployed by withdrawing the catheter. As the coil is withdrawn, it reverts to its original shape, and once both the coil and the distal end of the grasping forceps are outside the catheter sheath, a small amount of reverse tension is placed on the grasping forceps, after which they are opened to release the coil: the coil will then jump out of the forceps (Fig. 5 shows all coil deployment steps). The coil placement process can be reversed to reposition or retrieve the coil, if necessary (Fig. 6). The authors believe that this is only necessary at max for 1 or 2 coils and best to be performed at the end of the procedure if a coil sticks out of the individual segmental or lobar airways. Fluoroscopy is again terminated after verifying that the coil has been appropriately deployed. The whole process is repeated until 10-12 coils have been deployed for upper lobe treatment and 10-14 coils for lower lobe treatment. The coils are preferably not placed in the segments RB4/5 and LB5 for safety reasons and lack of efficacy and safety data for these positions.\nThe absolute DON'Ts of this procedure are:\n1.  Use the catheter to push the guidewire forward or advancing  the  catheter  distally  beyond  the  guidewire (Fig. 7).\n2.  Advance the catheter against significant resistance.\n3.  Placing the coil too distally (outside ball within 25 mm of the pleura), or proximally (inside ball outside the segmental ostium).\n4.  Trying  to  release  the  coil  by  unlocking  the  forceps, while the forceps are still inside the catheter.\n5.  Placing 2 coils in the same segmental bronchus.\n6.  Losing the position of the tip of the catheter (by moving to a more central position) during the deployment phase of the coil.\n7.

A multi-disciplinary team (pulmonology, radiology,  thoracic  surgery  and  pulmonary  rehabilitation knowledge) should be involved in selecting the most appropriate treatment for an individual patient. Frequently, pharmacological  and  non-pharmacological  treatment need to be optimized, substantially delaying or preventing the start of a coil treatment. It is important to ensure that the patient is not a frequent exacerbator, particularly due  to  infectious  bronchitis;  hence,  new  patients  may need to be monitored for a period prior to being considered for treatment.\nThe  patient  should  continue  their  routine  medications. The procedure is best performed under general anaesthesia  using  local  guidelines  on  both  airway  access (flexible  endotracheal  tube  +  positive  pressure  ventilation, or rigid bronchoscopy + jet ventilation) and anaesthetics used. Intubation with an un-cuffed endotracheal tube (Rusch or Portex) is recommended when the procedure is being performed under conscious sedation.\nAfter introduction of the bronchoscope, the airways are inspected, and bronchial secretions are collected for microbial cultures. Coils are placed according to the stepby-step procedure described above. After disconnecting the forceps from a coil, leave the catheter in the entrance of the treated segmental bronchus, ready to support the next coil placement nearby that position, with as little manipulation as possible, in this way avoiding oedema, secretions, haemorrhage and bronchoconstriction. Sometimes, mild or moderate haemorrhage may occur, which mostly responds well to gentle suction.  The  procedure time varies between 20 and 45 min and a fluoroscopy time of 5-15 min, depending on patient factors, anaesthesia technique and physician experience with the technique.",

The RENEW trial reported a 15% excess incidence\nof pneumonia in the coil versus usual care group, which is identical to earlier reports [17, 23]. A number of these pneumonias appeared to be non-infectious in nature and are now considered secondary to the force of the coils on the lung tissue causing an inflammatory response. This response results in dense consolidations, mimicking an organizing pneumonia, and are referred to as 'coil-associated opacity' (CAO) (Fig. 8). CAO thus behaves as a pneumonia, with chest discomfort, dyspnoea, low oxygen saturation,  cough,  elevated  inflammatory  markers  and consolidations around some of the coils on a chest X-ray. Fever and purulent sputum are less prominent and may be absent. Patients should be treated for pneumonia, with the addition of oral corticosteroids (0.5 mg/kg). After re-\ncovery, the patients who experienced a CAO normally are the best responders to the coil treatment due to significant reduction in treated lobar volume.\nIn the RENEW trial, there were 2 direct procedureassociated deaths; one patient died because of an intraprocedural pulmonary haemorrhage, and another patient died of respiratory failure 6 days following the second coil procedure  [11].  In  a  1-year  single-centre  retrospective analysis of 86 patients with severe Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), totally 4 patients  passed  away  within  the  first  3  months  after  the treatment due to complications [24]. All 4 patients suffered from severe pneumonia of the treated lung that was followed by sepsis and finally death; 2 of them also developed abscesses surrounding some of the coils, as was evi-\ndent on CT. The authors suggested that we need to further elucidate possible aggravating factors and reduce the number of adverse events.\nIn this respect, we recommend the following precautions:\n-  careful selection of patients avoiding a high risk for respiratory infections;\n-  routine  culture  of  bronchial  secretions  during  the bronchoscopy procedure;\n-  a low threshold for collecting microbiological cultures of sputum, and starting antibiotics in case of potential respiratory infections after the coil placement;\n-  and a low threshold to admit patients to the hospital once complications after the coil placement seem to occur, and to instruct treated patients about this.",

Treatment using regular pneumothorax  guidelines. Video-assisted thoracic surgery might be necessary if caused by a pleural tear due to inadvertent distal coil placement.\n-  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations 10%: can be managed by regular care.\n-  Pneumonia 10%: can be managed by regular care, be aware of CAO occurrence.\n-  Minor haemoptysis 50%: just post-procedure up to a few  days  after  a  tablespoon  amount  of  haemoptysis might  be  produced,  requiring  no  intervention.  It  is good to inform the patient about this.\n-  Major haemoptysis 1%: has been reported after treatment  in  patients  with  pulmonary  hypertension  or maintenance  anticoagulants  (not  aspirin).  Management using local guidelines.\n-  CAO 10-50%: very different incidence possibly due to a wide variety of coil placement techniques and patient selection. See above for treatment guidance.\n-  Avoid lung volume reduction coil treatment for patients with lifelong indications for systemic anticoagulants (except aspirin/ascal/carbasalate-calcium).",
