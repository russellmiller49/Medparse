Pulmonary carcinoid tumors are rare and account for 1% to 2% of adult lung malignancies. 2\nAlthough pulmonary carcinoid tumors are often visualized by bronchoscopy, bronchoscopic biopsy raises concern for bleeding complications because of their vascular appearance. The majority of studies pertaining to pulmonary carcinoid tumors are surgical case series without detailed analysis of bronchoscopic data. Reported incidence of moderate to severe hemorrhage associated with bronchoscopic biopsy of carcinoid tumors has been as high as 52%. 3 On the other hand, some studies have reported bronchoscopic biopsy of carcinoid tumors to be relatively safe. 4 -6\nOur study objective was to analyze the diagnostic yield and bleeding complications of bronchoscopic biopsy in patients with bronchial carcinoids in the current era. In addition, we sought to correlate diagnostic and bleeding rates with patient and tumor characteristics.",

The median age was 55 years (interquartile range: 38 to 66); 7 (15%) were active smokers, and 13 (28%) were former smokers. Seventeen patients (35%) had hemoptysis during the 12 months before procedure.\nEndobronchial biopsies consisted of 26 forceps biopsies, 6 electrocautery loop snares, 6 cryobiopsies, 14 endobronchial needle aspirations, and 6 rigid bronchoscopies with the intention of complete resection (9 patients underwent combined biopsy modalities in 1 procedure). Debulking was performed in 6 patients who underwent rigid bronchoscopy and 4 additional patients during /uniFB02 exible /uniFB01 beroptic bronchoscopy.\nTumor appearance on bronchoscopy was described as hypervascular in 25 patients (51%). Thirty/uniFB01 ve patients (71%) had centrally located tumors (mainstem and lobar bronchi) whereas 14 (29%) were located in segmental or subsegmental bronchi. Median tumor size at resection was 2.2 cm (interquartile range: 1.6 to 3.6). Among 43 patients with assessed histologic differentiation, 34 (79%) were typical and 9 (21%) were atypical carcinoid tumors; 6 patients did not have de /uniFB01 nitive resection at our institution to determine /uniFB01 nal classi /uniFB01 cation.\nBronchoscopic biopsy was diagnostic of carcinoid in 45 (92%) patients (Table 2).

Subsequent carcinoid diagnosis was con /uniFB01 rmed on surgical resection for all 4 patients.\nThirteen (27%) patients experienced moderate to severe bleeding at the time of bronchoscopic sampling. Only 1 patient (2%) experienced severe bleeding and required an intensive care unit (ICU) stay. There were no procedure-related deaths (Table 3). These 13 bleeding complications were caused by 7 endobronchial forceps biopsies, 3 electrocautery loop snares, 4 cryobiopsies (resulted in the case of severe bleeding from attempted debulking of an obstructing tumor), and 3 endobronchial needle aspirations (4 patients had combined biopsy modalities).

      "content": "In our study, bronchoscopic biopsy of endobronchial carcinoid tumors was associated with a high diagnostic yield (92%) and acceptable bleeding risk. Most patients had none to only mild bleeding which ceased spontaneously. Interventions for postbiopsy bleeding were needed in 27% of cases and only 1 patient (2%) experienced severe bleeding\nresulting in ICU stay without transfusion; there was no procedure-related mortality. No presenting clinical-related or tumor-related characteristics, including tumor vascularity or recent history of hemoptysis, correlated with increased bleeding risk. However, we acknowledge that our study is likely underpowered to detect important difference in the factors associated with bleeding. We were also unable to identify clinical-related or tumor-related characteristics that correlated with diagnostic yield.\nThe diagnostic yield for bronchoscopic biopsy in our study compares favorably to prior studies with reported diagnostic rates ranging from 48% to 100% (Table 4). 3 -6,9 -14 This broad range of diagnostic rates is explained, in part, by selection bias, including ours, which were all retrospectively compiled. Patients who underwent bronchoscopy but did not undergo bronchoscopic biopsy for various reasons would have been excluded from analysis. In addition, our study included only bronchoscopically visible endobronchial carcinoid tumors, where in recent years nonvisible pulmonary carcinoid tumors may be located and accessed using newer technologies such as endobronchial ultrasound. 19\nIn general, diagnostic /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopy is considered a safe procedure with low incidence of\nP -value: comparison between diagnostic and nondiagnostic groups.\nIQR indicates interquartile range.\nsigni /uniFB01 cant bleeding ranging from 0.2% to 5.0%. 20 -25 For the carcinoid patients in our cohort, by contrast, the incidence of moderate to severe bleeding was higher, although no or minimal bleeding was evident for the majority. The reported bleeding incidence in carcinoid patients undergoing bronchoscopic biopsy\nvary signi /uniFB01 cantly, ranging from 0% to 52%, in part, due to divergent criteria in de /uniFB01 ning bleeding severity and differing biopsy techniques (Table 4). 3 -6,9 -17 For example, some studies reporting absence of bleeding complications only accounted for ' signi /uniFB01 cant ' or ' appreciable ' hemorrhage without de /uniFB01 ning their\nP -value: comparison between NM (no or mild) group and MS (moderate or severe) group. IQR indicates interquartile range.\ncriteria. 4 -6 The hypervascular appearance of carcinoid tumors in combination with history of recent hemoptysis may cause hesitation in performing bronchoscopic biopsies in such patients. However, our study suggests moderate to severe bleeding requiring speci /uniFB01 c intervention is not common. Most moderate to severe bleeding if occurred was immediately controlled, with only 1 patient requiring ICU level monitoring postprocedure and with no long-term sequelae.\nIn general, /uniFB01 ne needle aspiration is believed to be safe and less traumatic. 19,20,26 In our cohort, it seemed to be associated with lower yields (2 nondiagnostic in 4, 50%) compared with other bronchoscopic biopsy techniques (forceps: 91%, cryo:100%) allowing larger samples. Cryobiopsy of endobronchial lesions yields larger biopsy specimens and provides better diagnostic yield compared with traditional forceps biopsy, both for assessing benign and malignant disease, but may increase bleeding risk. 27 -30 However, some authors argue the cold probe may exert a vasoconstrictive effect leading to decreased bleeding. 31,32 In our cohort, 67% of patients undergoing cryobiopsy experienced moderate (n = 3) to severe bleeding (n = 1), although diagnostic yield was 100%.\nOur study cohort of patients with endobronchial carcinoid tumors shared similar clinical and epidemiologic features to those generally attributed to patients with bronchopulmonary carcinoid tumors. These features include a mean age at diagnosis in the sixth decade of life, a slight prevalence in females over males, and high proportion of centrally located tumors, all of which are consistent with previous studies. 4,6,14,18,33 To the best of our knowledge, this is the /uniFB01 rst study to explore potential correlations between diagnostic and bleeding rates with patient and tumor characteristics in those undergoing bronchoscopic biopsy for endobronchial carcinoids.\nThere are several limitations of our study. First, a retrospective approach with limited sample size may introduce selection and information bias, with missing or incomplete data and inability to establish causation. Second, our samples do not represent the total population of pulmonary carcinoid patients, with diagnostic yield applicable only to those endobronchially visible at bronchoscopy. Although not common in clinical practice, the scenario of endobronchial carcinoid adds insights into procedurally related complications and yield in diagnostic management plans.\nIn conclusion, bronchoscopic biopsy of endobronchial carcinoid tumors is associated with high diagnostic yield and serious bleeding complications\nare rare. Hypervascular appearance or prior history of hemoptysis does not seem to predict higher risk of bleeding from bronchoscopic biopsy of carcinoid tumors.",
