    "abstract": "Background: No currently approved intervention counteracts airway metaplasia and mucus hypersecretion of chronic bronchitis in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, metered cryospray (MCS) delivering liquid nitrogen to the tracheobronchial airways ablates abnormal epithelium and facilitates healthy mucosal regeneration. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and safety of MCS in chronic bronchitis. Methods: Patients with a forced expiratory volume in 1 s of 30 -80% predicted who were taking optimal medication were recruited. Primary outcomes were feasibility (completion of treatments), efficacy (3-month change in St George ' s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)) and safety (incidence of adverse events). Secondary outcomes were lung function, exercise capacity and additional patient-reported outcomes. Results: 35 patients, 19 male/16 female, aged 47 -76 years, Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease grade I (n=3), II (n=10) and III (n=22), underwent staggered liquid nitrogen treatments to the tracheobronchial tree. 34 patients completed three treatments, each lasting 34.3±12.1 min, separated by 4 -6 weeks; one withdrew after the first treatment. ∼ 1800 doses of MCS were delivered. Clinically meaningful improvements in patient-reported outcomes were observed at 3 months: change in SGRQ -6.4 (95% CI -11.4 to -1.3; p=0.01), Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Assessment Test (CAT) -3.8 (95% CI -6.4 to -1.3; p<0.01) and Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) 21.6 (95% CI 7.3 to 35.9; p<0.01). Changes in CAT were durable to 6 months ( -3.4, 95% CI -5.9 to -0.9; p=0.01); changes in SGRQ and LCQ were durable to 9 months ( -6.9, 95% CI -13.0 to -0.9; p=0.03 and 13.4, 95% CI 2.1 to 24.6; p=0.02, respectively. At 12 months, 14 serious adverse events were recorded in 11 (31.4%) subjects; six (43%) moderate and eight (57%) severe. Nine were respiratory-related: six exacerbations of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), two pneumonias and one case of increased coughing; all recovered without sequelae.

      "title": "Introduction",
      "content": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a complex inflammatory lung condition characterised by airflow limitation, cough, dyspnoea and impaired quality of life [1]. Chronic bronchitis, defined as chronic cough and sputum production occurring on most days for ⩾ 3 months of two consecutive years [2], is a common clinical phenotype of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [3], and is associated with accelerated lung function decline [4 -6], worse health-related quality of life [7 -9], increased rate of exacerbations [7, 10, 11] and hospitalisations [5, 10] and reduced life expectancy [6, 12 -14].\nThere is no currently approved therapy that reverses the airway metaplasia and mucus hypersecretion of chronic bronchitis in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and restores the integrity and functionality of the respiratory tract epithelium. However, a novel approach is suggested by the observation that selective cellular ablation preserving extracellular structures is followed by rapid replacement with healthy tissue [15, 16]. Flash-freezing at -196°C induces intracellular ice crystal formation, disrupting cellular structures, but sparing the extracellular matrix, facilitating epithelial regrowth [17]. The RejuvenAir system (CSA Medical, Lexington, MA, USA) consists of a console which stores liquid nitrogen, and a disposable catheter with a radial spray head inserted through the working channel of a flexible bronchoscope. Using a specially developed algorithm, programmed doses of liquid nitrogen are delivered in a radial spray, termed metered cryospray, to the bronchial airways. It is designed to cryoablate abnormal epithelium and excessive mucous-producing goblet cells to a depth of 0.1 -0.5 mm and a width up to 10 mm [18]. Re-epithelialisation with healthy mucosa has been demonstrated within 48 h of cryospray treatment, and with durability to 106 days [19].\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy and safety of MCS therapy to treat patients with chronic bronchitis in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This report documents the outcomes at 12 months after the last delivered MCS treatment.",

The multicentre study was conducted in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Canada, and was approved by the respective competent authorities, institutional review boards or ethics committees at each site; all participating subjects provided written informed consent. The trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02483637). We recruited patients aged 47 -76 years with an established diagnosis of chronic bronchitis in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (defined as chronic cough and sputum production occurring on most days for ⩾ 3 months of two consecutive years) who had ceased smoking for ⩾ 2 months prior to enrolment and had not experienced a respiratory exacerbation in the past 6 weeks, but were persistently symptomatic despite guideline-approved therapy. The extensive inclusion and exclusion criteria were designed to maximise patient safety (supplementary table S1).",

Following receipt of a satisfactory report on the findings by the data safety monitoring board (DSMB), an additional 24 subjects were enrolled and underwent the three scheduled MCS treatments; 12-month follow-up was completed in February 2019.",

Details of the device and procedure have been published [17] and are outlined in the supplementary material (sections 2.3 and 2.4). General anaesthesia, sedative and associated medications were administered as per institutional guidelines and routine clinical practice.\nThe first treatment delivered MCS to the right lower lobe and main stem bronchus, the second to the left lower lobe and main stem bronchus, and the third to both upper lobes, any residual main stem bronchus and the distal end of the trachea. Precautionary measures were employed to avoid barotrauma and asphyxia: before each spray the cuff of the endotracheal tube was deflated, and the ventilator disconnected briefly. Chest radiography was performed 1 h post-procedure to exclude pneumothorax. The right middle lobe was omitted from the procedure on account of the perceived increased risk of barotrauma in a small structure. Endobronchial biopsies were obtained from the right lower lobe in the initial 11 patients at baseline and at day 60.\nIntervals of 30 -45 days were imposed between each of the three MCS treatment sessions, and progression to the next treatment was contingent on the subject remaining stable without evidence of a recent acute exacerbation.",

      "content": "We have shown that MCS administered to patients with chronic bronchitis in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) produced statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in patient-reported outcomes at 3 months. The\nreduction in total SGRQ score was driven by ' symptoms ' and ' impact ' domains and was durable at 9 months. The symptoms domain includes the assessment of cough and sputum production, which the RejuvenAir system is designed to ameliorate, and has been suggested as a robust descriptor of the chronic bronchitic phenotype prone to exacerbations [24]. The reduction in SGRQ total score was accompanied by clinically relevant gains in CAT and LCQ scores at 6 and 9 months, respectively, reinforcing the beneficial impact of MCS treatment on multidimensional disease-specific and treatment-responsive patient-reported outcomes evaluating cough and sputum production. Subjects with poorer baseline health status (defined as a total SGRQ score of >50 points) experienced substantially greater benefits in these domains that persisted out to 12 months and which may inform future patient selection.\nThe use of MCS therapy was safe and feasible. All but one subject completed the three treatments and the ratio of full-dose sprays exceeded 84% at each of the procedures. None of the device observations resulted in an adverse event and the majority were resolved by replacing the catheter. All patients were fit for discharge on the day of their treatment. The treatment was safe, with 2.4% of adverse events related to the device and 15.9% to the procedure, all were mild or moderate, and resolved without sequelae. There were no deviceor procedure-related serious adverse events. The RejuvenAir system is intended to induce a regenerative endobronchial tissue effect by 1) destroying abnormal surface epithelium with mucin-producing goblet cell hyperplasia; 2) promoting normal ciliated bronchial epithelium regrowth without globlet cell hyperplasia; and 3) reducing chronic inflammation and associated airway constriction. The modest decline in FEV1 observed might reflect the epithelial-focused nature of this treatment to airways that have since remodelled on a background of natural disease progression [25].\nMost of the safety events were related to natural progression of their disease or unrelated medical disorder. Post-treatment exacerbation frequency increased with GOLD grade, consistent with the experiences of others in the literature [26]. From completion of treatment 1 to 12 months, the exacerbation rates of subjects classified as GOLD grades II and III were 1.29 and 2.10 per patient-year, respectively. These rates compare favourably to those reported in untreated similarly matched individuals: 2.68 per patient-year in GOLD grade II and 3.43 per patient-year in GOLD grade III [27]. Higher baseline total SGRQ score was associated with an increased exacerbation rate and this mirrors a large dataset of 12043 patients in whom a higher SGRQ total score predicted increased risk of an adverse Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) outcome (exacerbations, hospitalisation or death) [28]. A reduction in SGRQ achieved using the RejuvenAir MCS treatment may translate to a reduction in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations, particularly in more symptomatic individuals [24], although this is speculative.\nThe study had some limitations. In the interest of risk adversity, there was a prolonged interval of 9.4 (8.7 -10.8) months between the first and third treatments in the initial 11 (phase A) patients, which may have influenced the efficacy of the therapy and skewed the overall 12-month outcomes, potentially diluting the effects on patient-reported outcomes demonstrated in this study. Multiple validated, but nevertheless subjective, disease-specific instruments (SGRQ, CAT and LCQ) were necessary to characterise complex symptoms such as cough, sputum production, breathlessness and health-related quality of life and their responses to a therapeutic intervention that could not be achieved using any one physiological correlate [29]. The sample size was small, the treatment was unblinded, and a control group was lacking. Moreover, there were no consistent historical data on pre-treatment exacerbation rates. Lastly, no definitive histological differences were observed between baseline and day 60 endobronchial biopsies and may reflect nonuniform sampling as cryothermic sites were not directly marked or grossly identifiable. The forceps biopsies were obtained from the right lower lobe segmental carina and were of varying quality, with crush artefacts. Furthermore, the samples were obtained from mucosal tissue at the carina where there tend to be fewer goblet cells. A more standardised approach within a sham controlled study and sampling using endobronchial cryobiopsies has been initiated and should provide more informative results (ClinicalTrials. gov NCT03892694).\nBronchial rheoplasty is an alternative novel bronchoscopic therapy using pulsed electric fields to ablate the mucosal lining and is currently under investigation [30]. However, no comparable treatment option exists in the mainstream management of chronic bronchitis and current therapeutic modalities are principally pharmacology based. The effects of RejuvenAir MCS on health-related quality of life may be superior compared to mucolytics [31], prophylactic antibiotics [32], inhaled bronchodilators and steroids [33]. Future studies including a randomised sham-controlled trial are advocated to confirm the benefits and durability of this treatment in a larger population of patients.",
