      "content": "In this trial of patients with malignant pleural effusion, treatment with an indwelling pleural catheter vs talc pleurodesis resulted in fewer hospitalization days from treatment procedure to death (or 12-month follow-up), but the magnitude of\nthe difference was of uncertain clinical importance. The data alsoshowedthatpatientstreatedwithindwellingpleuralcatheter over talc pleurodesis experienced fewer hospital days related to pleural effusion management and required fewer further invasive pleural drainages. Both indwelling pleural catheter and pleurodesis provided significant improvements in breathlessness and QoL; however, there were no significantdifferences betweenthe2groups.Thesefindingsmayinform patients and clinicians in deciding management.\nIndwelling pleural catheter and pleurodesis are 2 strategies with advantages and disadvantages 22 ; existing literature suggests equipoise. 8 Todate, 3 RCTs 9,10,23 have compared indwelling pleural catheter with talc pleurodesis (n = 106 and n = 57) or doxycycline pleurodesis (n = 144). Both indwelling pleural catheter and pleurodesis provided comparable symptomatic benefits in these studies; neither was found superior. This trial confirmed these findings and provided new data showinganadvantageofindwellingpleuralcatheterinreducing hospitalization. This study, to our knowledge, was the first to measure total days spent in hospital in patients' remaining lifespan as a principal outcome in malignant pleural effusion management.Malignantpleuraleffusionsheraldlimitedprognosis. The management goals are to relieve symptoms with minimal intervention and maximize time outside hospital. Post-hoc analysis showed that the use of indwelling pleural catheter significantly reduced the amount of time in trial patients spent in hospital (median, 6.2% vs 11.1% of their days in trial) over conventional pleurodesis.\nIndwelling pleural catheter provided several advantages over talc pleurodesis that would have contributed to the reduction in the total hospitalization days before death. First, patients randomized to indwelling pleural catheter treatment had shorter initial hospital admissions because indwelling pleural catheters were placed as day-case or overnight procedures whereas pleurodesis required chest tube insertion, complete evacuation of fluid, talc instillation, and hospitalization until fluid drainage ceased. Second, talc pleurodesis failed and necessitated further drainage interventions in 23% of patients in the trial, most of whom required admissions for further interventions. This failure rate is in keeping with other trials. 6,24 Conversely, only 4% of indwelling pleural catheter-treated patients required further pleural drainages. The lower reintervention rate with indwelling pleural catheter is an important consideration and benefit for patients with advanced cancer.\nThe data also showed that indwelling pleural catheterspecific complications (eg, empyema) were relatively uncommon, consistent with other longitudinal studies, 25-27 and did not increase the median hospitalization days. Both QoL and breathlessness significantly improved from baseline in the indwelling pleural catheter and pleurodesis groups; however, there was no difference between the groups, a finding consistent with another previous RCT. 9\nThe shortening of total hospitalization time by a median of 2 days is of uncertain clinical importance because there are no established minimal clinically important differences for this end point. This difference may be important to the hospital care system because it frees up substantial hospital beds",

The AMPLE-2 trial is an RCTcomparingaggressive (daily) indwelling pleural catheter drainages with symptom-guided 'as-required' approach for dyspnea relief and likelihood of spontaneous pleurodesis 28 (trial registration: ACTRN12615000963527). Whether talc instillation via an indwelling pleural catheter can improve pleurodesis rate is the subject of the recently completed IPC-PLUS trial 29 (trial registration: ISRCTN73255764). Indwelling pleural catheter coated with a sclerosant (silver nitrate) has shown promise in animal studies 30 and in a pilot clinical study. 31\nTalc can be administered as slurry via a chest tube or as dry powder via thoracoscopic poudrage. Previous RCTs showed that talc slurry and poudrage have similar failure rates 6,7 ; whether the different delivery methods affect lifetime all-cause hospitalization has not yet been studied. Australia has one of the world's highest incidences of mesothelioma. 32 This study therefore included more patients with mesothelioma than would otherwise be expected in many countries. The study randomization did stratify patients by mesothelioma (vs other cancers) and subgroup analyses showed benefits in reducing hospitalization days.",

      "content": "This study has several limitations. First, no health economic analyseswereconducted.Thisdecisionwastakenasthecosts of hospital days, indwelling pleural catheter equipment and drainage kits, and pleurodesis vary vastly worldwide, 33,34 including at the participating centers of this study. The investigators therefore made a decision at the start of the study not to proceed with cost analyses. However, based on the rough costs provided by the participating centers, there is a reasonable likelihood that savings from the reduction in the small number of hospitalization days found in this study will not meettheusualstandardsofcost-effectiveness.Cliniciansneed\nto translate the reduction of hospital days into local cost currenciestoestablishthehealthcaresavingsinindividualhealth systems.\nSecond, variations are common on talc pleurodesis protocolsandnouniversallyacceptedstandardexists.Inthispragmatic study, treating clinicians were allowed to perform talc pleurodesis following their center's routine practice (including drain size). A recent study suggested that pleurodesis via a 24F chest drain can improve the failure rate over 12F drains (24%vs30%,respectively). 7 However,themarginofimprovement was relatively small and unlikely to affect total hospitalization days.\nThird,therateratiosfor(serious)adverseeventshavelarge confidence intervals because of the small numbers of adverse events and should be interpreted carefully. There were morenonseriousadverseeventsintheindwellingpleuralcathetergroupcomparedwiththepleurodesisgroup.Manyofthese complications (eg, blocked catheters or cellulitis) needed interventions, although not necessarily hospitalizations; nonetheless, they may reduce the advantage of reducing hospital days indwelling pleural catheter has over talc pleurodesis.\nFourth, although indwelling pleural catheter provided an advantage in reduction of hospitalization days, the magnitude of difference was below the 5 days used for power calculation. Both this and a prior study 9 found that indwelling pleural catheter and talc pleurodesis provided significant QoL improvement but neither was significantly better than the other. These factors should all be incorporated in the clinical decision-making process for the individual patient.",
