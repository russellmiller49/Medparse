      "content": "Flexible bronchoscopy is commonly used for the diagnosis and management of a variety of pulmonary diseases. However, it is an invasive procedure that can induce coughing, pain, dyspnea and other adverse effects (1,2). The use of sedatives not only can increase patients' safety and comfort (3) but also can make it easier for the bronchoscopist to perform the procedure and thus avoid extending its duration (4). In addition to alleviating the physiological response to airway irritation during the procedure (5), the proper sedatives should have a rapid onset and a short duration of action, in addition to allowing rapid recovery.\nPropofol,  a  non-opioid  and  nonbarbiturate  sedative hypnotic agent, is frequently used in the induction and maintenance of anesthesia. The properties of rapid onset and offset of action and of smooth recovery (6) make propofol an appealing agent alone or in combination with an opioid for procedural sedation (7-10). However, dose-dependent respiratory depression and hypoxemia are possible, owing to interactions and synergism between sedatives and opioids (11-13).\nDexmedetomidine, a highly selective α2 -adrenoceptor agonist, has an affinity for α 2 -adrenoceptors that is 8-fold greater than that of clonidine  (14). In addition to providing sedative and analgesic effects (15), dexmedetomidine can be applied generally during fiberoptic intubation or other difficult airway procedures without respiratory depression (16-18). Research has revealed that dexmedetomidine alone is inferior to a combination of propofol and fentanyl for maintaining hemodynamic stability during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (19). However, few data are available regarding the effectiveness of a combination of dexmedetomidine and fentanyl for bronchoscopy. Therefore, the present prospective, randomized study was conducted to test the hypothesis that dexmedetomidine-fentanyl is as effective as propofol-fentanyl for providing satisfactory peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) and maintaining hemodynamic stability in patients undergoing flexible bronchoscopy.",

This study (registration number: ChiCTR-TRC-13003904) enrolled 100 patients undergoing flexible bronchoscopic procedures (for example, bronchoalveolar lavage or transbronchial biopsy) who provided written evidence of informed consent. The patients, whose ages ranged from 20 to 75 years (mean, 60.11 years) and who had an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status of I-III, received treatment at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University at some point between December 2013 and May 2014. They were initially randomized to either of two groups, namely a propofol-fentanyl group (PF group; n=50) or a dexmedetomidine-fentanyl group (DF group; n=50), on the basis of a computer-generated randomization list. Exclusion criteria included the following items: Psychological disorders, hypersensitivity or allergy to the study drugs, uncontrolled hypertension (uncontrolled blood pressure >140/90 mmHg), major abnormalities of liver function, ischemic heart disease and severe respiratory disease.\nWhen patients arrived in the operating room, they underwent insertion of a peripheral intravenous cannula for fluid and drug administration. Their electrocardiograms and SpO 2 were monitored continuously during the procedure, and blood pressure was automatically and noninvasively measured every 5 min. At least 5 min prior to the initiation of fentanyl administration and during the entire bronchoscopic procedure, each patient received supplemental oxygen at a rate of 4 l/min via nasal cannula. When SpO 2 was <90% for >30 sec, which was defined as oxygen desaturation or hypoxemia, oxygen delivery was increased to 6 l/min (20) and airway assistance maneuvers or devices were used, including verbal and tactile stimulation, chin lifts, jaw thrusts, a face mask and manual ventilation.\nFlexible bronchoscopy. Any one of four experienced bronchoscopists used a bronchoscope of the same diameter to perform transnasal bronchoscopy in all patients, who were placed in a semi-recumbent position. Topical anesthesia was provided by spraying 2% lidocaine into the nasopharynx and oropharynx. In addition, 3-ml aliquots of 1% lidocaine were sprayed over the vocal cords, onto the trachea, and onto the right and left main bronchi. Supplemental local anesthesia was given as deemed necessary by the bronchoscopist. No inhaled lidocaine was administered prior to the procedure (21).\nPropofol was infused in a target-controlled manner. However, to guarantee the patients' safety, a dose of 1 µg/kg dexmedetomidine was used for at least the initial 10 min, and then a continuous intravenous infusion rate of 0.2-0.7 µg/kg/h was used, which is in line with the guidelines set forth in 1999 by the US Food and Drug Administration (22).\nBefore starting sedation, patients in both groups received an infusion dose of 1 µg/kg fentanyl (batch no. 1130506; Yichang Humanwell Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Yichang, China). Thereafter, the patients in the DF group received a  loading  dose  of  1  µg/kg  dexmedetomidine  (batch  no. 13031516: Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co., Ltd., Jiangsu, China), infused continuously for ~12 min, and the loading dose was followed by a continuous intravenous infusion at a rate of 0.5 µg/kg/h (23). The three-compartment pharmacokinetic model was used, with the infusion of propofol administered via a target-controlled syringe infusion pump (Injectomat TIVA Agilia; Fresenius Kabi, Paris, France), according to\neach patient's age and weight. The initial effect-site target for propofol (batch no. JV642; AstraZeneca, Basiglio, Italy) concentration was 4 µg/ml in the PF group. Subsequently, the concentration of propofol was maintained at a level between 2 and 4 µg/ml (24) during the 12-min infusion period. Loading doses of dexmedetomidine or propofol were observed to achieve adequate conscious sedation, indicated by the onset of ptosis. Whenever indications of insufficient sedation were observed, including signs of pain or discomfort, agitation, a persistent cough, and inadequate motor or verbal response to manipulation, an additional 2 ml of 2% lidocaine was administered into the trachea through the side hole of a flexible bronchoscope. The number of times that additional lidocaine was administered was recorded.\nOutcome variables. The primary study objectives were the mean SpO2 and hemodynamic variables. During the proce dure, the SpO 2 and hemodynamic variables, including heart rate (Hazard ratio (HR)), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), were recorded for both groups at the following time points: 1 min before initiation of fentanyl administration (T1 ), at the initiation of flexible bronchoscopy (T 2 ), 1 min after initiation of bronchoscopy (T 3 ), 5 min after initiation of bronchoscopy (T 4 ) and at the end of bronchoscopy (T 5 ).\nSecondary objectives were cough scores and discomfort scores as assessed by the patients themselves and also by the bronchoscopists. At the end of the procedure, bronchoscopists were asked to record their perception of the patient's cough during the procedure, using a 10-point visual analog scale (VAS) on which 0 represented no cough and 10 represented incessant coughing. Two hours after bronchoscopy, patients were asked to record their perception of their own coughing associated with the procedure, using the same 10-point VAS. Patients and bronchoscopists were asked to use a 10-point VAS to rate patients' discomfort associated with the procedure, where 0 represented no discomfort and 10 represented the greatest possible discomfort. Willingness to undergo repeat bronchoscopy was also recorded.\nThe level of sedation was assessed at T 2 and  T 4 using the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) scale, detailed in Table  I (25). Indications for flexible  bronchoscopy, type of bronchoscopy, duration of\nReproduced with permission from Drake et al (25).\nprocedure, and elapsed time until recovery were recorded for all patients. Recovery time was defined as the time (min) elapsed between withdrawal of a flexible bronchoscope and the moment that the patient was fully awake and conversant.\nAdverse events. Hypotension (SBP <90 mmHg or mean arterial pressure <60 mmHg) was treated with an infusion of 10 mg ephedrine. Bradycardia (Hazard ratio (HR) <60 beats/min) was treated with an infusion of 0.3 mg atropine. Hypertension (SBP >180 mm Hg or DBP >100 mm Hg) and tachycardia (Hazard ratio (HR) >100 beats/min and/or variation of >20% from baseline value) were treated by administering an additional 2 ml of 2% lidocaine into the trachea.\nStatistical  analysis. In  a  large  study,  Grendelmeier et  al investigated the safety of sedation with propofol in flexible bronchoscopy and reported a mean SpO2 of 93% [standard\ndeviation (SD), 4.3%] in their propofol group  (26). For the present smaller study, it was determined that a sample size of 44 participants per group was necessary for a two-sided significance level (α) of 0.05 and a power of 0.9 to detect a 3% difference in the mean SpO 2 between the two groups. Assuming a 10% dropout rate, the actual size needed for each group was 50 participants. The formula used to calculate the sample size that was required was the following: n=2 [(µα/2+µβ) σ/δ] 2 , in which δ=3, σ=4.3, α=0.05 and β=0.1. According to the µ  value table, µ 0.05/2 =1.96 and µ 0.1 =1.282, which were added into the formula (n=44).\nThe data are presented as mean ± SD, or as number with the percentage of patients in parentheses. Repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to test between-group differences in SpO2 , Hazard ratio (HR), SBP and DBP over time. Continuous outcomes were analyzed with the Student's t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test as appropriate in terms of data distribution. Categorical data were examined with the χ 2 test, Fisher's exact test, or Mann-Whitney U test as appropriate. Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS for Windows, version 18.0; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A P-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.",

      "title": "Discussion",
      "content": "The results of the present study show that a combination of dexmedetomidine and fentanyl is superior to a combination of propofol and fentanyl, the reasons for which are discussed below.\nA variety of sedatives, including benzodiazepines, opioids and propofol, have been used for bronchoscopy. However, certain studies have shown that following the use of sedatives,  recovery  times  are  longer  and  more  desaturations occur (27,28). Although dexmedetomidine produces sedative, analgesic and hypnotic affects, unlike other sedatives it provides respiratory stability and does not cause any clinically relevant respiratory depression (29). This finding has also been confirmed by further research, which showed that dexmedetomidine safely produces satisfactory sedation during fiberoptic intubation or other difficult airway procedures  (16-18,30). Moreover, dexmedetomidine has no effect on end-tidal carbon dioxide (31), preserves better arterial saturation  (32) and improves oxygenation (33).\nIn the present study, the incidence of hypoxemia in the patients treated with dexmedetomidine was much lower than in the patients treated with propofol. This is in agreement with the results of a study by Liao et al (34). This trend has previously been explained as being due to the addition of an opioid to propofol resulting in oxygen desaturation in patients undergoing bronchoscopic procedures (35).\nAccording to a study by Adachi et  al ,  hemodynamic responses during flexible bronchoscopy reflect an increase in Hazard ratio (HR) and blood pressure (36). In the present study, a greater increase in Hazard ratio (HR) and blood pressure at initiation of bronchoscopy were observed among patients who were given propofol compared with those who were given dexmedetomidine. These findings show that a combination of dexmedetomi dine and fentanyl is superior to a combination of propofol and fentanyl in attenuating hemodynamic responses during flexible bronchoscopy and that specifically, the former combi -nation maintained hemodynamic stability in the early stage of the procedure. This was a better result than that reported by Ryu et al for a dexmedetomidine group compared with a remifentanil group during flexible bronchoscopy  (37); they found no differences between outcomes for those two sedatives.\nNotably, VAS scores for patients' coughing and discomfort,  as  recorded  by  patients  and  bronchoscopists  were no  different  between  the  dexmedetomidine  and  propofol groups. These results differed from those of He et al (38) and Hendrickx et al (39) who found that dexmedetomidine had a less pronounced amnesic effect, which might have occurred because dexmedetomidine interacted synergistically with fentanyl to produce deep hypnosis (38,39). This might also explain why dexmedetomidine was associated with a longer recovery time. However, on the basis of the present research methodology, the current study focused on numbers of patients who were given additional lidocaine two or more times. The\nexact amount of lidocaine administered was not recorded. As a result, whether the total amount of additional lidocaine correlated with the effects of propofol or dexmedetomidine administration was not determined; thus, it is not possible to directly draw conclusions regarding the influence of propofol compared with dexmedetomidine on cough and discomfort scores. Therefore, the amount of lidocaine spray used should be recorded in future investigations.\nThe main adverse effects of dexmedetomidine include bradycardia, hypotension, and hypertension (40). Bradycardia was observed more often in the dexmedetomidine group than in the propofol group. Although the two groups displayed both hypotension and hypertension, the incidence of these conditions did not differ between groups.\nThe present study had the following limitations. First, it was not a blinded study. Patients' level of sedation was assessed by MOAA/S at only two time points during flexible bronchoscopy. That might have influenced the results. To remove sedation level as a confounding factor in future studies, depth of anesthesia should be assessed by monitoring equipment at additional time points, along with mean SpO 2 values and hemodynamic variables. Second, aside from bradycardia, hypotension and hypertension, other adverse effects of dexmedetomidine that have been observed in other studies, such as delirium, nausea, vomiting, and shivering, were not recorded. Future studies must address those additional effects.\nIn conclusion, with the exception of a longer recovery time and higher incidence of bradycardia, the present study found  that  dexmedetomidine-fentanyl  was  superior  to propofol-fentanyl  in  providing  satisfactory  sedation  and peripheral oxygen saturation during flexible bronchoscopy. Furthermore, dexmedetomidine-fentanyl attenuated hemodynamic responses and maintained hemodynamic stability in the early stage of bronchoscopy.",
