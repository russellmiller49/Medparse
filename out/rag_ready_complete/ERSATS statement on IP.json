E-mail: ctb@gerga.sun.ac.za\nThe purpose of this European Respiratory Society/ American Thoracic Society (ERS/ATS) Task Force position paper is to define the field of interventional pulmonology as well as to describe the minimal requirements in methodology and logistics, the indications, contraindications, outcome and training requirements for each interventional procedure. This position paper has been prepared by a group of European and North American experts.\nInterventional pulmonology can be defined as \" the art and science of medicine as related to the performance of diagnostic and invasive therapeutic procedures that require additional training and expertize beyond that required in a standard pulmonary medicine training programme \" . Disease processes encompassed within this discipline include complex airway management problems, benign and malignant central airway obstruction, pleural diseases, and pulmonary vascular procedures. Diagnostic and therapeutic procedures pertaining to these areas include, but are not limited to, rigid bronchoscopy, transbronchial needle aspiration, autofluorescence bronchoscopy, endobronchial ultrasound, transthoracic needle aspiration and biopsy, laser bronchoscopy, endobronchial electrosurgery, argon-plasma coagulation, cryotherapy, airway stent insertion, balloon bronchoplasty and dilatation techniques, endobronchial radiation (brachytherapy), photodynamic therapy, percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy, transtracheal oxygen catheter insertion, medical thoracoscopy, and imaging-guided thoracic interventions. The latter two topics are not dealt with in this paper, as they have recently been covered by extensive reviews elsewhere in this journal [1, 2].",

      "title": "Preprocedure evaluation",
      "content": "Before any procedure, the patient 9 s history must be taken and a thorough physical examination must be given. For appropriate patient selection, the physician must obtain information on previous therapies and current performance status. Laboratory tests ( e.g. complete blood count, electrolytes, coagulation\nprofile, electrocardiogram, chest radiograph) are recommended. Additional studies such as computed tomography (CT), pulmonary function tests, and assessment of arterial blood gases may be required depending on the nature of the procedure.\nIndications for therapeutic endoscopic treatment are mainly palliation of advanced cancerous lesions, but increasingly also a cure of early lung cancer. The former is mainly indicated for the relief of dyspnoea due to central airway obstruction, and the preoperative evaluation should ideally establish that the lung beyond the obstruction is viable and that dyspnoea is effectively related to the obstruction. Figure 1 schematically illustrates the three main types of malignant airway obstruction. Curative treatment of early lung cancer is an area in full development and clear guidelines cannot be given at this stage. For clarification of the terminology in this field, the various endoscopically-visible lesions from normal tissue to invasive carcinoma are defined as follows: 1) normal tissue: normal epithelium without significant histological change; 2) inflammation: characterized by marked infiltration of acute and chronic inflammatory cells, without significant atypia/dysplasia; 3) metaplasia/hyperplasia: mucus cell hyperplasia, basal cell hyperplasia without atypia (two to three layers maximum); 4) mild atypia/dysplasia: basal cell hyperplasia with nuclear atypia, three or more layers confined to the lower one-third of stratum, slight nuclear enlargement, rare mitotic figure; 5) moderate atypia/dysplasia (abnormal/premalignant change): basal cell hyperplasia with nuclear atypia, basal cells extending into the lower two-thirds of stratum, slight nuclear enlargement with loss of polarity, occasional mitotic figure; 6) severe atypia/dysplasia (abnormal/ premalignant change): basal cell hyperplasia with nuclear atypia, basal cells extending to upper onethird of full thickness of stratum, nuclear enlargement, loss of polarity, uneven chromatin disbursement, frequent mitotic figures, keratinization; 7) carcinoma in situ (abnormal/premalignant change): polyhedral cells with variably-sized nuclei, loss of polarity, uneven chromatin disbursement, frequent mitotic figures, keratinization; 8) microinvasive carcinoma (abnormal/ premalignant change): infiltration of cancer within the bronchial mucosa, but not extending any deeper into the wall; and 9) invasive carcinoma (abnormal/ premalignant change): infiltration of cancer into the bronchial cartilage and bronchial wall.",

Once the trachea is entered, the bronchoscope is rotated back 90 u and advanced toward the lower airways. To examine one of the bronchial trees, the bronchoscopist rotates the patient 9 s head toward the contralateral shoulder.\nIn an intubated patient, the bronchoscope is advanced along the endotracheal tube to the level of the vocal cords. The endotracheal tube is then removed and the bronchoscope passed into the trachea. Another technique of intubation involves the use of a laryngoscope to lift the epiglottis anteriorly and allow passage of the bronchoscope to the level of the vocal cords. At this point, the operator looks through the bronchoscope and guides it through the vocal cords. A telescope is used through the bronchoscope to provide adequate visualization to the level of the segmental airways. A number of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures can be performed through the rigid bronchoscope.",

The chest radiograph and the CT of the chest should be thoroughly reviewed to locate the lesion precisely before elective TBNA. For peripheral lesions, TBNA should be performed with fluoroscopic guidance. When staging lung cancer, contamination of samples with bronchial secretions should be avoided. The flexible bronchoscope can be introduced into the bronchial tree without using suction. Tracheobronchial secretions covering the target site should be washed off. TBNA can be performed before the endobronchial examination and prior to obtaining any endobronchial specimens. Syringe suction, applied at the proximal end of the TBNA catheter, should be ceased before the needle is withdrawn from the tracheobronchial wall. In patients with multiple lymph node station involvement, the nodes with the worst prognosis (N3) are sampled first. Two satisfactory specimens should be obtained from each target site. Each disposable needle should be used in one patient only.\nCytological specimens can be prepared immediately by spraying the sample on a slide for on-site inspection or for fixation. Flushing the sample into a preservative solution for a cellblock is also acceptable and is the preferred method for histological specimens. Cytological specimens must be read by an experienced cytopathologist. Rapid on-site evaluation of the specimen improves the diagnostic yield. Each specimen should be clearly classified as definite, malignant, or negative. Staging of bronchogenic carcinoma should not be based on a small number of tumour cells. The presence of a large number of lymphocytes in the specimen establishes that it is adequate for a lymph node sample. Respiratory epithelial cells in the sample should raise concern about possible contamination. A true positive sample exhibits a large\nnumber of tumour cells in clumps or gland formation. A true negative sample should have a large number of lymphocytes. A negative TBNA does not rule out malignancy. Every positive result should be interpreted individually, using a team approach of the clinicians involved.",

      "content": "Laser bronchoscopy can be performed with flexible or rigid bronchoscopes. Most experts prefer the rigid bronchoscope technique for four reasons: 1) the use of general anaesthesia is more comfortable for the\npatient and the physician; 2) the open tube allows the laser fibre, suction catheters, and forceps to be used simultaneously; 3) ventilation and excessive bleeding are more easily controlled with the rigid bronchoscope; and 4) the bronchoscope can be used to perform dilatation and mechanical resection, thus shortening procedure time, diminishing the amount of laser exposure, and providing more complete relief of obstruction. Furthermore, if indicated, silicone stent placement can be performed during the same procedure. Among the relative disadvantages of the rigid technique are the increasing cost of the procedure, resulting from the need for general anaesthesia, operating room time and personnel, as well as the fact that upper lobe lesions are not easily treated. The flexible bronchoscope can be used through the rigid bronchoscope in conditions when increased manoeuvrability is required.\nSafe laser resection depends on maintaining ventilation, preventing haemorrhage, and minimizing laser exposure. The nonobstructed airways must be inspected frequently and kept clear of debris, clots and bloody secretions. To minimize the risk of haemorrhage, it is important to coagulate the lesion with low laser power ( e.g. 30-45 watts (W), pulse duration of 1 s, fibre distance at 1 cm) before resection. If the fibre is too close to the target ( e.g. within 3 mm), the tissue will be charred and vapourized. Laser exposure should be minimized by using mechanical resection whenever possible. Continuous suction is recommended to remove smoke. Oxygen saturation should be continuously monitored. Inspired oxygen concentration should not be w 40% in order to minimize the risk of igniting flammable devices ( e.g. suction catheters, laser fibres, flexible endoscopes).",

      "title": "Rationale",
      "content": "The various endoscopic treatment modalities are fairly new, and many therapeutic endoscopists are familiar with only a few of them. Therefore, reports comparing various endoscopic techniques for identical indications are rare. Some of these techniques are almost exclusively competitive, such as laser and endobronchial electrosurgery; therefore, most specialists will use either the one or the other. Some techniques are complementary ( e.g. stents and laser or stents and endobronchial electrosugery); they are classically combined in mixed lesions (fig. 1) that have an endoluminal component, amenable to resection and an extraluminal component that needs dilatation and stent insertion to maintain airway patency. The relative values of each technique for a certain type of airway lesion are listed in table 3, which provides guidance for selecting treatment combinations.\nA topic that has not been extensively investigated is the combination of endoscopic with nonendoscopic treatment modalities. This combination is mainly\nused in the treatment of inoperable malignancies of the central airways. In practical terms, multimodality treatment in these situations means the combination of radiochemotherapy with one or more endoscopic treatment modalities. The term multimodality, as used by oncologists, usually refers only to radioand/or chemotherapy as well as surgery. It is the opinion of this task force that the term should be expanded to encompass endoscopic treatment.\nIt is very important to decide what form of treatment should be used, and in what situation. Figure 2 shows a recently proposed algorithm for the management of malignant central airway obstruction. The choice of the initial treatment largely depends on the urgency of the situation as well as on previous treatment. High-grade obstructions at the level of the trachea, of the main carina, or of both main bronchi often must be relieved by emergent endoscopic treatment in order to guarantee survival. To assess the technical feasibility of endoscopic treatment and to plan treatment, diagnostic bronchoscopy must be performed, most often (in nonvital situations) with a flexible bronchoscope. If a lesion is resectable, as most benign lesions are, surgery is the treatment of choice. For unresectable central airway lesions (usually defined as up-to-lobar level) that cause symptoms or reduce the airway diameter by w 50%, many endoscopists prefer to relieve the obstruction endoscopically before proceeding to nonendoscopic modalities. Airway obstruction of w 50% seems a reasonable indication for performing endoscopic treatment, as patients with obstruction to this degree are usually symptomatic or can become symptomatic when nonendoscopic treatment ( e.g. radiotherapy) causes\nAPC: argon plasma coagulator; PDT: photodynamic therapy. # : contraindicated in impending respiratory failure; } : indicated if postinterventional airway lumen is v 50% of normal.\ntissue swelling. The decision to select endoscopic treatment will always have to be individualized. In malignancies, it also depends on the tissue diagnosis. Small cell carcinomas and lymphomas are chemosensitive, so they can be treated nonendoscopically even when they cause w 50% obstruction. In reality, however, the majority of patients with malignant disease who are referred for endoscopic treatment have already exhausted all nonendoscopic options.",

Multimodality treatment has also been shown to extend the duration of local tumour control. However, to date, there are no data unequivocally showing what endoscopic treatment to use as well as what multimodality approach might be best to use in a particular situation. Therefore, it is clear that prospective outcome studies are needed.\nThe suggested reading for this section is [51, 79-83].",
