However, no studies have reported prospective 24-month follow-up from a large, multinational, generalizable cohort. This study evaluated ENB safety, diagnostic yield, and usage patterns in an unrestricted, real-world observational design. Methods: The NAVIGATE single-arm, pragmatic cohort study (NCT02410837) enrolled subjects at 37 academic and community sites in seven countries with prospective 24-month follow-up. Subjects underwent ENB using the superDimension navigation system versions 6.3 to 7.1. The prespeci /uniFB01 ed primary end point was procedurerelated pneumothorax requiring intervention or hospitalization. Results: A total of 1388 subjects were enrolled for lung lesion biopsy (1329; 95.7%), /uniFB01 ducial marker placement (272; 19.6%), dye marking (23; 1.7%), or lymph node biopsy (36; 2.6%). Concurrent endobronchial ultrasoundguided staging occurred in 456 subjects. General anesthesia (78.2% overall, 56.6% Europe, 81.4% United States), radial endobronchial ultrasound (50.6%, 4.0%, 57.4%), /uniFB02 uoroscopy (85.0%, 41.7%, 91.0%), and rapid onsite evaluation use (61.7%, 17.3%, 68.5%) differed between regions. Pneumothorax and bronchopulmonary hemorrhage occurred in 4.7% and 2.7% of subjects, respectively (3.2% [primary end point] and 1.7% requiring intervention or hospitalization). Respiratory failure occurred in 0.6%. The diagnostic yield was 67.8% (range: 61.9% -70.7%; 55.2% Europe, 69.8% United States). Sensitivity for malignancy was 62.6%. Lung cancer clinical stage was I to II in 64.7% (55.3% Europe, 65.8% United States). Conclusions: Despite a heterogeneous cohort and regional differences in procedural techniques, ENB demonstrates low complications and a 67.8% diagnostic yield while allowing biopsy, staging, /uniFB01 ducial placement, and dye marking in a single procedure. /C211 2021 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer",

      "content": "Although lung cancer is the leading cause of cancerrelated death in the United States, 5-year survival is substantially higher for cancers diagnosed at localized stages (59%) compared with late-stage diagnoses (6%). 1 Lung cancer screening may further reduce mortality rates 2,3 ; however, optimal patient management would ideally minimize the number of invasive procedures conducted for benign disease. In an era of increased scrutiny over resource utilization, technologies with the ability to perform multiple procedures in the same setting and accelerate treatment are also critical to improve the ef /uniFB01 -ciency and effectiveness of lung nodule evaluation. Clinical practice guidelines recommend diagnosis and staging of the mediastinum in a single setting to improve coordination of care and reduce time, cost, and risk. 4\nImage-guided techniques have advanced the /uniFB01 eld of bronchoscopy in the past 20 years. 5 Minimally invasive options such as radial endobronchial ultrasound (rEBUS) and electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) improve the diagnostic accuracy of bronchoscopy for early stage lung cancer and reduce the need for more invasive surgical procedures. 6 ENB also allows for lung biopsy, tissue collection for molecular testing, mediastinal staging, and /uniFB01 ducial or dye marking to facilitate treatment in the same procedure. Despite those advantages and a reduced complication risk compared with percutaneous lung biopsy, 7 the lower diagnostic yield of ENB is a limitation.\nNew imaging techniques and robotic navigation platforms have recently emerged with the goal of improving the localization accuracy of ENB and other forms of advanced bronchoscopy. 8 -14 As these technologies mature, there is a need to identify which outcomes are generalizable across diverse settings. This requires a solid foundation of evidence in a real-world population against which to compare new devices. Although the safety and effectiveness of ENB-guided\nbiopsy have been evaluated in more than 40 clinical studies, 15 most have been small ( < 100 patients), single center, and retrospective (Fig. 1).\nNAVIGATE is the largest multicenter ENB study to date and the only study with prospective 24-month follow-up in a multinational cohort. 16 -18 The objective of this report is to describe the /uniFB01 nal global data with a focus on safety, diagnostic yield, and usage patterns across Europe and the United States.",

      "content": "NAVIGATE (NCT02410837) is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm, pragmatic cohort study of ENB using the superDimension navigation system, versions 6.3 to 7.1 (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota). Consecutive adult subjects presenting with lung lesions requiring evaluation and judged by physicians as suitable for an ENB procedure were enrolled. The pragmatic, observational design intentionally placed no restrictions on patient or lesion selection, procedural technique, complementary tools or imaging, concurrent /uniFB01 ducial marker or pleural dye placement, molecular testing, or lymph node staging (method or timing). Follow-up through 24 months was prespeci /uniFB01 ed at all sites. All follow-up procedures (e.g., surgical tissue biopsy, repeat\nENB, computed tomography [CT]-guided transthoracic needle biopsy or aspiration [TTNA], serial CT imaging, and lung health visits) were prospectively captured. Independent source data veri /uniFB01 cation was conducted in 33.3% of data, and all safety end points and procedurerelated adverse events were adjudicated by an independent medical monitor.\nThe primary end point was the incidence of procedure-related pneumothorax grade 2 or higher (requiring intervention or hospitalization), according to the validated Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. 18 The primary end point was chosen as a safety end point applicable to ENB-guided lung lesion biopsy, /uniFB01 ducial placement, or dye marking. Pneumothorax grade 2 or higher could also include subjects kept overnight in the hospital for observation only, without requiring a chest tube. Secondary end points were the overall incidence of ENB-related pneumothorax, ENB-related bronchopulmonary hemorrhage grade 2 or higher, ENBrelated respiratory failure grade 4 or higher, subject health status and quality of life evaluated by the threelevel version EQ-5D questionnaire, 19 subject satisfaction at 1 month, and subject productivity and activity at 1 month. Other secondary end points were captured on the basis of the purpose of the individual procedure performed and included diagnostic yield, sensitivity,\nspeci /uniFB01 city, positive predictive value, negative predictive value (NPV), the repeat biopsy rate, adequacy of samples for molecular testing and mutation type, diagnosis, stage at diagnosis, accurate /uniFB01 ducial placement as evaluated by follow-up imaging, the success rate of pleural dye marking revealed by surgical resection, and the success rate of obtaining a lymph node biopsy. 18 ENB-aided diagnostic yield, sensitivity, speci /uniFB01 city, positive predictive value, and NPV were evaluated with respect to malignancy in subjects undergoing ENB-guided lung lesion biopsy. Diagnostic yield at 24 months was calculated as the rate of true positives (for malignancy) plus true negatives (TNs) (for malignancy) out of all attempted lung lesion biopsies. All ENB-aided results other than a malignant diagnosis (including histologic con /uniFB01 rmation of benign disease) were considered negative for malignancy and then followed for 24 months to\nestablish true versus false negative (FN) status. For the calculation of diagnostic yield in biopsy subjects who died or exited the study before 24 months, the last established diagnosis on the basis of follow-up data was carried forward. Negative cases with insuf /uniFB01 cient information to evaluate diagnostic yield were included in a sensitivity analysis, assuming all were FN or TN, to provide low and high estimates. Additional details have been published. 16 -18\nNo formal sample size estimates or statistical power calculations were conducted for this single-arm, observational study. Analyses were performed using SAS Version 9.4 (SAS Inc., Cary, NC). Data are summarized by descriptive statistics, including frequency distributions and cross-tabulations for discrete variables and median and interquartile range for continuous variables. Univariate and multivariate logistic\nregression models were conducted to determine predictors of diagnostic yield. After selecting candidate variables, multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted using stepwise selection procedures with an entry signi /uniFB01 cance level of 0.20 and an exit signi /uniFB01 cance level of 0.05.\nThis study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and all local regulatory requirements.

Malignancy was diagnosed in 42.6% (537 of 1260), and 57.4% (723 of 1260) were negative for malignancy on the basis of the ENBaided procedure (Table 2).\nThese initial outcomes were then evaluated over 24 months by the decision pathway in Figure 3. There were no false positives. Of the 723 cases initially considered negative for malignancy, 285 were TN, 321 were FN, and 117 remained indeterminate at 24 months (Fig. 3). The global diagnostic yield was 67.8% (822 of 1212). The\ndiagnostic yield denominator was the total number of biopsy subjects (1329) minus the 117 indeterminate cases. In a sensitivity analysis, the diagnostic yield ranged from 61.9% to 70.7% assuming all 117 indeterminate cases were FN or TN, respectively. Diagnostic yield was 69.8% (range: 63.3% -72.6%) in the United States and 55.2% (range: 52.3% -57.5%) in the EU. In the global, U.S., and EU cohorts, sensitivity for malignancy (TP/TP þ FN) was 62.6% (range: 55.1% -62.6%), 65.6% (range: 57.2% -65.6%), and 44.7% (range: 41.7% -44.7%) whereas NPV (TN/FN þ TN) was 47.0% (range: 39.4% -55.6%), 49.6% (range: 40.8% -58.5%), and 34.6% (range: 31.9% -39.8%), respectively. The sensitivity for malignancy in the global cohort was 70.4% (range: 62.3% -70.4%) in lesions greater than or equal to 20 mm and 51.8% (range: 45.2% -51.8%) in lesions less than 20 mm. Speci /uniFB01 city for malignancy and positive predictive value were 100%. Results on the basis of pretest probability of malignancy are detailed in\nSupplementary Data 6.

A personal history of cancer and average lesion size less than 20 mm were statistically signi /uniFB01 cant multivariate predictors of lower diagnostic yield. Diagnostic yield was 73% versus 62% in lesions greater than or equal to 20 mm and less than 20 mm, 73% versus 62% in lesions with and without a bronchus sign, and 75% versus 67% in lesions with and without ROSE use, respectively. Bronchus sign presence was the only signi /uniFB01 cant factor in the European cohort. Notable candidate variables found to be not signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with diagnostic yield included the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, rEBUS use (67.9% with versus 67.7% without), and the physician-estimated pretest probability of malignancy.",

      "content": "As with all procedures in medical practice, the choice of a diagnostic biopsy technique requires a tradeoff between risks and bene /uniFB01 ts. Although ENB has traditionally had a lower diagnostic success rate than percutaneous biopsy, it has a lower complication risk and also allows for the biopsy of multiple nodules and mediastinal staging in the same procedure. NAVIGATE was designed as an observational study to provide real-world data on the safety and effectiveness of ENB across a heterogeneous cohort. As such, the primary safety end point (pneumothorax) and the secondary effectiveness end points (e.g., diagnostic yield, sensitivity for malignancy, success rates of /uniFB01 ducial placement or dye marking) evaluated the risk-to-bene /uniFB01 t tradeoff in community and academic practices across seven countries. The NAVIGATE results reveal the utility of ENB as a minimally\ninvasive platform to support a safe, multimodal approach to lung cancer and facilitate the diagnostic decision-making process. As this article is the /uniFB01 rst presentation of the global primary and secondary end point results, it reports both the safety and the 24-month diagnostic utility of the ENB procedure. When analyzed closely, several important themes emerge.",

      "content": "Minimally invasive bronchoscopic biopsy of any kind is not necessarily an end point, but rather a step in the diagnostic process to inform the probability of malignancy and the next step forward. Furthermore, when evaluating a suspicious lung lesion, any diagnostic result other than malignancy requires diligent follow-up to con /uniFB01 rm or refute the negative outcome. For example, even an ENB-aided histologic con /uniFB01 rmation of infection, such as Aspergillus , can sometimes grow adjacent to malignancy. NAVIGATE used prospective 24-month follow-up with a prede /uniFB01 ned algorithm for the hierarchy of certainty to determine true negative versus FN diagnoses. These decisions are rarely straightforward, and the interpretation of pathologic results may not be binary (cancer versus not cancer). Although not a prespeci /uniFB01 ed objective of the study, NAVIGATE sheds light on how the navigation platform is used in the diagnostic process.\nAlthough previous single-center studies by expert users have observed higher diagnostic yields, 25 -28 the 67.8% diagnostic yield in NAVIGATE elucidates how the technology performs in the general community. 29 The lack of real-time image guidance and the occurrence of CT-to-body divergence may also prevent the diagnostic yield from routinely approaching that of CT-guided TTNA. 30 Compared with historical rates, technologies with real-time guidance and intraprocedural location correction have revealed higher diagnostic yields than the ENB system versions used in NAVIGATE. 8,11,31 Nonetheless, ENB remains a useful tool to aid in lung cancer diagnosis and management by providing a minimally invasive method to safely inform the probability of malignancy while allowing biopsy, staging, tissue collection for molecular testing, and /uniFB01 ducial or dye marking in the same procedure.",

      "title": "ENB Usage Patterns",
      "content": "NAVIGATE suggests that ENB is used more broadly than previously expected in patients with higher pretest probability of malignancy, in late-stage disease, to localize tumors for treatment, and in the same setting as mediastinal staging. For example, 61% of NAVIGATE subjects had a pretest probability of malignancy greater than 65%. Although these patients would typically be considered for surgery, 32 patients and surgeons increasingly require a con /uniFB01 rmed diagnosis and stage before resection, preferably during the same minimally invasive procedure as suggested by guidelines. 4 Among all NAVIGATE patients undergoing a surgical lung resection, 40.5% (139 of 343) received an ENB-aided malignant diagnosis before surgery with a 39-day median time to resection, suggesting obtaining a diagnosis did not signi /uniFB01 cantly delay treatment.\nLinear Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided staging was performed concurrently with ENB in 456 NAVIGATE subjects. The order of lung lesion biopsy and lymph node staging was not prescribed or captured in NAVIGATE, although any patient who obtained a diagnosis by linear Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) that precluded the need for ENB would not have been enrolled. 16 Although guidelines recommend that patients with suspected mediastinal involvement undergo nodal sampling /uniFB01 rst, increased awareness of the causes and sequelae of iatrogenic atelectasis has prompted some operators to instead sample lung nodules /uniFB01 rst. 33,34\nStudies of rEBUS-guided biopsy have suggested a comparable diagnostic accuracy to ENB (72.4% rEBUS versus 76.4% ENB in one meta-analysis) with similar safety pro /uniFB01 les, yet at a lower cost. 35 Notably, rEBUS is not a directional tool but rather is a con /uniFB01 rmatory imaging technology that requires a bronchus sign to access the lesion. In NAVIGATE, concurrent use of rEBUS during the ENB procedure did not affect diagnostic yield, but it was associated with lower pneumothorax rates. rEBUS was used in only 4% of NAVIGATE procedures in Europe, compared with 57% in the United States.\nENB-guided /uniFB01 ducial or dye marking was also conducted in more than 20% of subjects, with success rates of 99% and 91%, respectively, in previously published analyses. 20,21 NAVIGATE also revealed that ENB was used in late-stage disease, possibly in support of tissue acquisition for molecular or mutation analysis, 16 or for contralateral disease in the setting of multiple lesions.",

Future bronchoscopic studies from different countries will need to consider variations in operator experience, access to technology, and reimbursement.
