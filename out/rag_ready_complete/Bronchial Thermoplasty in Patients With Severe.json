RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the 5-year efficacy and safety results in patients with severe asthma who have undergone bronchial thermoplasty? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a prospective, open-label, observational, multicenter study conducted in the United States and Canada. Subjects 18 to 65 years of age who were taking inhaled corticosteroids ≥ 1,000 μg/d (beclomethasone or equivalent) and long-acting beta-agonists ≥ 80 μg/d (salmeterol or equivalent) were included. Severe exacerbations, hospitalization, ED visits, and medication usage were evaluated for the 12 months prior to and at years 1 through 5 posttreatment. Spirometry was evaluated at baseline and at years 1 through 5 posttreatment. RESULTS: A total of 284 subjects were enrolled at 27 centers; 227 subjects (80%) completed 5 years of follow-up. By year 5 posttreatment, the proportion of subjects with severe exacerbations, ED visits, and hospitalizations was 42.7%, 7.9%, and 4.8%, respectively, compared with 77.8%, 29.4%, and 16.1% in the 12 months prior to treatment. The proportion of subjects on maintenance oral corticosteroids decreased from 19.4% at baseline to 9.7% at 5 years. Analyses of subgroups based on baseline clinical and biomarker characteristics revealed a statistically significant clinical improvement among all subgroups. INTERPRETATION: Five years after treatment, subjects experienced decreases in severe exacerbations, hospitalizations, ED visits, and corticosteroid exposure. All subgroups demonstrated clinically significant improvement, suggesting that bronchial thermoplasty improves asthma control in different asthma phenotypes.

Ten percent of patients have severe, poorly controlled disease despite optimal medical therapy. These patients account for > 80% of asthma-related health care costs. 1-3\nBronchial thermoplasty (BT) is the only Food and Drug Administration-approved procedure for the treatment of asthma. It is indicated for patients $ 18 years of age with severe persistent asthma not well controlled with inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) and long-acting betaagonists (LABAs). BT uses radiofrequency energy to heat the airway walls in a controlled manner. The mechanism of action is attributed to a reduction in airway smooth muscle mass after the procedure. 4-9 Reduction in airway smooth muscle has been associated with clinical improvement seen in patients undergoing BT. 5,6 Other structural and immunohistologic changes after BT, including reduction in reticular basement membrane thickness, reduction in collagen type I deposition, and changes in neuroendocrine cells, may also contribute to clinical improvement. 4,6,10,11\nSeveral randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of BT have been carried out in subjects with moderate to severe asthma, including the Asthma Intervention Research (AIR), Research in Severe Asthma (RISA), and Asthma Intervention Research 2 (AIR2) studies. 12-15 These studies demonstrated improvements in asthma control after BT, including decreased numbers of asthma exacerbations, ED visits, and hospitalizations. In addition, subjects experienced improved quality of life as measured by Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQ) scores. 15 These improvements persisted for at least 5 years and side effects were minimal. 14 Nevertheless, data obtained from prospective studies with more clinically realistic eligibility criteria than those de /uniFB01 ned by previous RCTs can provide reassurance that these results can be duplicated in clinical practice, which often includes subjects with more severe disease.\nAfter Food and Drug Administration approval in 2010, the Post-FDA Approval Clinical Trial Evaluating BT in Severe Persistent Asthma (PAS2) was initiated. An interim analysis of data from the /uniFB01 rst 190 PAS2 subjects con /uniFB01 rmed previous reports that BT is safe and effective. 16 Although the PAS2 subjects were sicker than those in the AIR2 trial (94.7% of PAS2 subjects vs 82.1% of AIR2 subjects were classi /uniFB01 ed with severe asthma based on the European Respiratory Society/American Thoracic Society",

Results: Out of 284 subjects enrolled in the PostFDA Approval Clinical Trial Evaluating BT in Severe Persistent Asthma, 227 subjects (80%) completed 5 years of follow-up. By year 5 posttreatment, the proportion of these subjects with severe exacerbations, ED visits, and hospitalizations was 42.7%, 7.9%, and 4.8%, respectively, compared with 77.8%, 29.4%, and 16.1% in the 12 months prior to treatment.

Subgroup analyses based on baseline clinical and biomarker characteristics revealed a statistically signi /uniFB01 cant clinical improvement among all subgroups, including those based on eosinophil and neutrophil counts.\nInterpretation: Five years after treatment, subjects experienced decreases in severe exacerbations, hospitalizations, ED visits, and corticosteroid exposure, indicating clinically relevant improvements in asthma control. The subgroup analyses performed indicate BT may be a valuable add-on therapy for the treatment of subjects with severe asthma including those on oral corticosteroids and omalizumab. BT may also be a treatment option for people with severe asthma who cannot use or do not qualify for biological therapy for asthma (eg, those with noneosinophilic disease).\nBirmingham, AL; the St Joseph Medical Center (N.

      "title": "Discussion",
      "content": "With 284 patients enrolled, PAS2 is the largest study to date designed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of BT and the durability of treatment effect in subjects with poorly controlled asthma despite treatment with the\n]\ncurrent standard of care. Previous clinical trials of BT (AIR, AIR2, and Research in Severe Asthma [RISA]) have shown that the procedure is safe and effective, but subjects enrolled in these clinical trials may not be representative of the most severe asthma cases considered for BT in clinical practice. For example, the AIR2 RCT excluded patients with insulin-dependent diabetes, interstitial lung disease, chronic sinus disease, OSA, and other common comorbidities found in people with asthma, but the PAS2 allowed participation of subjects with these conditions. Publications have reported on BT in people with more severe asthma that were older and had worse baseline lung function and quality of life. 4,6-8,28 These data indicated a clinical improvement post-BT in these subjects and acceptable rates of adverse events. Additionally, Chaudhuri et al 29 recently reported that the clinical improvements after BT can last for $ 10 years after treatment in some subjects. PAS2 adds to the body of evidence demonstrating the long-term safety and effectiveness of BT outside the setting of RCTs.\nAlthough PAS2 is a single-arm study, the /uniFB01 ndings are important and con /uniFB01 rm previously published interim results in this population, 16 indicating that clinically relevant improvements in asthma control (particularly signi /uniFB01 cant reductions in severe exacerbations) are sustainable to 5 years of follow-up.\nThe people with severe asthma in PAS2 had relatively well-preserved pulmonary function (FEV1 in the 75%80% range). 30 People with asthma, particularly those with severe asthma, experience a progressive decline in lung function as measured by FEV1 with time (22.550 mL/y). Subjects who experience more severe exacerbations per year tend to exhibit a more rapid decline in FEV1. 30-33 As shown in previous publications, 14-16 there is no signi /uniFB01 cant decline in FEV1 and FVC up to 5 years after BT, highlighting the longterm safety of the BT procedure.\nIn PAS2, 14.7% of subjects experienced procedurerelated serious adverse events during the treatment period. This was slightly higher than in previously reported trials of BT, 14,34 perhaps because of enrollment of subjects with more severe asthma and more comorbidities in PAS2. The most common periprocedural respiratory serious adverse event was asthma aggravation (77.8%), due in part to the length of the bronchoscopic procedure required and/or the thermal injury sustained during the procedure. Although hospitalization was required for all\nperiprocedural respiratory serious adverse events, intubation and/or mechanical ventilation was reported in only four cases, two because of hemoptysis. One occurred 1 week after the second BT treatment; the subject was intubated, underwent bronchoscopy to suction a blood clot, and had the third BT treatment. The second occurred 1 month after the third BT procedure; the subject was intubated, an embolization procedure was performed, and the subject completed follow-up. A third subject experienced vocal cord spasm 30 min after the /uniFB01 rst BT treatment and required intubation until the spasm resolved; the subject recovered but did not undergo further BT treatments. The last subject experienced an asthma exacerbation requiring intubation in the ED 1 day after the second BT treatment; the subject recovered and completed the third BT treatment, but withdrew before the 3-year follow-up.\nPAS2 subjects were able to reduce exposure to corticosteroid medications, particularly OCSs, after BT. Forty-two percent of subjects on OCSs were able to completely discontinue them after BT treatment while simultaneously improving asthma control. This is encouraging because daily use of OCSs is associated with signi /uniFB01 cant side effects and negative impact on quality of life. 35 This suggests that BT should be considered as a treatment option for patients who are taking systemic corticosteroids and are experiencing or concerned about these side effects. 36\nAlthough we were unable to identify a speci /uniFB01 c subgroup of patients in which BT was most effective using baseline data, BT was effective in all subgroups, including subjects with both /uniFB01 xed and reversible airways and both high and low eosinophil counts. Interestingly, patients with low blood eosinophil counts responded favorably to BT, suggesting that BT can be considered as a treatment option for patients that are not candidates for a biological therapy. 37,38\nOne limitation of the PAS2 study was that it did not include a sham or control group, and the effect of closer follow-up of patients in the setting of a clinical study on potential medication reductions and improvement in asthma control cannot be ruled out. Another limitation is that, as in all open-label extension studies, the subjects who were not followed for the entire 5-year period tended to be people with more severe asthma with worse prognosis, which introduced bias. Although changes in quality of life scores (AQLQ) would have been useful to present, AQLQ scores were only collected at baseline in PAS2 and we were unable to analyze the effect BT had\nthem. The PAS2 subjects were heterogeneous in terms of asthma phenotype, and the subgroup analysis based on asthma phenotype was post hoc and based on counts of blood eosinophils and neutrophils taken at baseline for a subset of subjects. However, it has been hypothesized that sputum cellular pro /uniFB01 les may be a more accurate measure of the type of in /uniFB02 ammation occurring in the airways because blood counts of eosinophils and neutrophils may not always correlate perfectly with sputum cellular pro /uniFB01 les. 37 This limited our ability to accurately phenotype the subjects. Studies in which asthma phenotype is more clearly de /uniFB01 ned are required to determine whether certain types of asthma respond better to BT. Finally, because we did not compare responses after BT to responses to biological medications, it is not known whether the response to biological medications in this study population would have been more pronounced than the response to BT. It is possible that because biological medications selectively target proin /uniFB02 ammatory pathways, and BT largely acts on processes involved in airway remodeling, the two\ntreatments could be complementary in people with severe asthma with evidence of both airway in /uniFB02 ammation and airway remodeling. We did observe that BT was safe and improved clinical outcomes regardless of whether or not biological medications, including those targeting IL-5, were initiated after treatment (data not shown); however, we recognize that the PAS2 study was not controlled and that the asthma treatment landscape is shifting, which is a challenge for all trials involving this disease.",
