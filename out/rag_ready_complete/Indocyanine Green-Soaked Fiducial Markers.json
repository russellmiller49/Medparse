Shah, MD; and Ganesh Krishna, MD\nBACKGROUND: Peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs) are increasingly identi /uniFB01 ed and often require a tissue diagnosis to guide treatment. Although a surgical resection may combine diagnosis and treatment, it may lead to excessive healthy tissue being removed if the lesion is dif /uniFB01 cult to localize. Bronchoscopic PPL marking before surgery facilitates this process, but it is limited by current technologies. Advances in procedural techniques may improve this process.\nRESEARCHQUESTION: What is the impact of using indocyanine green-soaked /uniFB01 ducial markers (ICG-Fs) to mark PPLs before surgery compared with unmarked resected PPLs?\nSTUDYDESIGNANDMETHODS: A retrospective review of patients from 4 institutions with PPLs undergoing bronchoscopy with ICG-F marking (54 nodules) before resection were compared with unmarked nodules (63 nodules). Demographic data, nodule characteristics, procedural and surgical information, and /uniFB01 nal pathology results were obtained.\nRESULTS: Demographics were similar between the groups. PPLs were smaller in the ICG-F marked group (axial: ICG-F marked: 14.39 /C6 5.39 vs unmarked: 20.31 /C6 14.24 mm; P ¼ .0036; coronal: ICG-F marked: 12.66 /C6 5.13 vs unmarked: 16.43 /C6 10.51 mm; P ¼ .0214).

Operative time was increased in the ICG-F marked group (165 /C6 53 vs 136 /C6 43 minutes; P ¼ .0021).\nINTERPRETATION: Our /uniFB01 ndings indicate that ICG-F is a safe and accurate procedure to facilitate lung sparing surgery of otherwise undetectable PPLs immediately after bronchoscopic placement or up to 13 days later.

Although different\ntechniques are used to improve this procedure, 12,13 minimizing healthy lung tissue removal during surgery remains a challenge.\nStudies have shown that minimally invasive lung sparing surgery is noninferior to lobectomy for patients with early stage lung cancer. Compared with lobectomy, patients undergoing sublobar resection had comparable overall survival, 14 fewer postoperative complications, 15 and improved postoperative measures of quality of life. 16 Patients undergoing segmentectomy had a superior 5year overall survival rate compared with those undergoing lobectomy. 17 Thus, there is a growing desire to provide appropriate patients with minimally invasive lung sparing surgery. 18\nOne approach to facilitate surgical wedge resection is to localize the lesion via bronchoscopy. 19,20 Multiple techniques have been used, including pleural marking with stains and dyes and placement of /uniFB01 ducial markers in and around the lesion, 19,20 depending on availability and physician preference without any clear guidelines. Bronchoscopic /uniFB01 ducial marker placement is safe and effective 21 and may reduce time to surgery compared with percutaneous marking. 22 Similar results have been seen with pleural dye marking. 23,24\nSuccessful nodule marking, however, lacks a clear de /uniFB01 nition because it is usually subjectively assessed by the proceduralist. 21 Procedure failure occurs when the surgeon is unable to clearly visualize or palpate the lesion for resection, which may be due to dye dispersion into the pleural space 23 or lack of /uniFB01 ducial marker retention. 25 These errors potentially increase procedural time, change the operative approach, increase the amount of healthy lung tissue resected, and result in failure to remove the diseased portion of the lung. 23\nNodule marking may also be limited by the accuracy of the bronchoscopic portion of the procedure. Previous studies have shown that current electromagnetic navigation-guided bronchoscopy has a limited sensitivity for diagnosing malignancy. 26 Initial studies using shape-sensing robotic-assisted navigational bronchoscopy (ssRANB) technology have shown an improvement in procedural sensitivity for malignancy, including for lesions < 2 cm in diameter. 27-31\nA report has also highlighted the potential to improve the PPL marking process further by coupling dye and /uniFB01 ducial marking together in 1 procedure. 32 Placement of indocyanine green-soaked /uniFB01 ducial markers (ICG-Fs) allowed for surgical resection to occur up to 9 days after",

At each center, all consecutive patients who underwent bronchoscopy with ICG-F before surgical resection were included in the ICG-F marked group.

Matching numbers of consecutive patients, strati /uniFB01 ed by each site, who had undergone robotic surgical resection without marking in the time period immediately prior were selected. This group comprised the unmarked group and consisted of patients who could not undergo ICG-F because this technique was not yet available at the institution.\nDemographic data, nodule characteristics, procedural and surgical information, and /uniFB01 nal pathology results were obtained.

A total of 0.2 to 0.5 mL of a prediluted mixture of ICG (25 mg of ICG dye mixed with 10 mL of sterile water resulting in a 2.5 mg/mL ICG dye concentration; NDC-70100-424-02; HUB Pharmaceuticals) was drawn through a standard 1-mL tuberculin syringe with a Luer lock and injected into a 7 /C2 3 mm in tapering diameter from widest to narrowest /C2 8 cm in length Cook Tornado coil cartridge sheath (Cook Medical LLC). Ten minutes was chosen to prime the sheath of the catheter to allow the ICG solution to reach the /uniFB01 -bers of the coil and soak the synthetic /uniFB01 bers of the coil within it with the ICG dye.

      "content": "We present our initial multicenter experience using ICG-F to mark PPLs. This approach was technically successful with the ability to clearly identify all lesions with ICG-F marking and allowed resection up to 13 days after bronchoscopy. We found that using this novel approach for small PPLs facilitates lung sparing surgery of otherwise undetectable lesions immediately after bronchoscopic placement or up to 13 days later without an increase in duration of chest tube placement or hospital stay; however, there was a statistically signi /uniFB01 cant increase in total surgery time.\nFor pulmonary nodules that are > 5 mm from the pleural surface and < 10 mm in size, the probability of failing to detect the nodule during a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery approach is > 60%. 33 Additionally, pure groundglass opacities, which are being detected with increasing prevalence on outpatient CT scans, 34 are challenging to palpate. When the surgeon cannot visualize or palpate the lesion, conversion from a minimally invasive approach to an open thoracotomy may be required. Although this approach ensures the diagnosis, it also leads to increased postsurgical pain and length of stay. 35 Although conversion rates have decreased over time, a metaanalysis reported a 9.6% median conversion rate with most due to technical issues (eg, dif /uniFB01 cult lymph node dissection, tumor size and/or location, challenging patient anatomy, presence of adhesions). 36 Thus, successful\nlocalization of PPLs before resection may facilitate a minimally invasive surgical approach, which is more germane in an era of increasing interest in the use of sublobar resections for early stage lung cancers or potentially metastatic lesions.\nInitial results with ssRANB for diagnosing peripheral pulmonary nodules have shown increased sensitivity for malignancy, 27-31 including for lesions < 2 cm in diameter. 28-31 As such, we used ssRANB with cone beam CT scan or intraprocedural 3-dimensional mobile /uniFB02 uoroscopy for secondary con /uniFB01 rmation to guide lesion marking. Although mean lesion size in the ICG-F marked group was signi /uniFB01 cantly smaller, both groups contained a similar number of PPLs in the outer third of the lung and in their radiographic bronchus sign distribution (Table 2). Although some of these characteristics are usually associated with poorer diagnostic yields 37-39 and may have impacted our results because only 78% (39 of 50) of the biopsied lesions had a con /uniFB01 rmed bronchoscopic diagnosis, accurately targeting a nodule or another area (eg, pleural surface for dye, distal or proximal location for coil placement) for marking before surgical resection may offer a way to overcome this challenge. After bronchoscopy was completed, all ICG-F marked lesions were able to be clearly visualized with the near-infrared illumination system without broad dye dispersion. Nonpalpable lesions (eg, ground-glass and subsolid lesions) (n ¼ 15, 26%) were marked with similar ef /uniFB01 cacy to solid nodules\n(n ¼ 42, 74%) (Table 2). Additionally, metastatic lesions were also readily marked (n ¼ 10, 18%). These scenarios speak to the broad applicability of this technique in various surgical situations, including lung sparing\nsurgeries in which a wedge resection or segmentectomy may be preferred rather than an upfront lobectomy. In contrast, other scenarios exist in which marking may not be indicated (eg, more central lesions which would\nData are expressed as mean [SD] or as otherwise indicated.

Future studies will thus be important to determine what patients may optimally bene /uniFB01 t from a marking technique.\nThe use of new technologies also presents the possibility of new challenges. Surgical time was signi /uniFB01 cantly increased by an additional 29 minutes in the ICG-F marked group (Table 4). The reason for this /uniFB01 nding is unclear at this point, but may be attributed to the initial subjective assessment that the ICG-F marked nodules were more dif /uniFB01 cult to locate, which is supported by their smaller size in comparison with the unmarked lesions, thus necessitating them to be marked for localization. This increased surgical time could also be attributed to the need to meticulously dissect complex, deeper anatomic structures (eg, bronchovascular planes, lymphatic tissues) while performing segmentectomies and lobectomies for marked PPLs compared with taking a more generous piece of unmarked tissue. 40 This hypothesis may be supported by the smaller size and weight of the marked surgical specimens in our resected segmentectomy and wedge resection subgroups (Table 3). Although we do note the lesions in the ICG-F marked group were signi /uniFB01 cantly smaller (Table 2), thus potentially facilitating resection of less tissue, the limited sample size makes further assessment of this /uniFB01 nding challenging. It is also possible that because more bronchoscopic marking procedures are performed at our institutions and others, the mean surgical time will decrease as seen in other studies. 41,42 Reassuringly, no differences in clinical end points (eg, chest tube duration, length of stay) were found between the groups. Additionally, no patients in the ICG-F marked group required conversion to lobectomy to ensure that the lesion was removed, pointing to the value in accurately marking otherwise obscure lesions that may not be easily found and allowing for this to occur multiple days before surgery. Although our study was not designed to assess this difference in surgical time, future comparisons will need to be performed to determine if this increase persists and if so, elucidate possible explanations for it.\nAlthough there appears to be value in this procedure to facilitate lung sparing surgery, dye and /uniFB01 ducial marking for PPLs are underused. In a prospective\nstudy of 1,215 patients undergoing electromagnetic navigation-guided bronchoscopy in the United States, 258 patients had /uniFB01 ducial markers placed, 9 but only 23 patients had a dye marking procedure. 12 However, the cohort had > 60% of its lesions located in the outer third of the lung with radiographic evidence of a limited disease and 6.3% of the lesions were classi /uniFB01 ed as ground-glass opacity. 14 It is unclear why lung nodule localization is not commonly performed. Potential barriers include access to the procedure/ proceduralist, logistical challenges within institutions, and reliance on an open surgical approach.\nOur initial /uniFB01 ndings showed that ICG-Fs retain their /uniFB02 uorescence-emitting abilities for at least 9 days after implantation at the time of surgery. 20 Our current study increases that time to at least 13 days, thus allowing for even further time between bronchoscopic procedure and surgical resection. This approach may facilitate surgery for patients without ready access to thoracic surgeons, thus potentially solving 1 obstacle and allowing better outcomes at centers of excellence. 43,44 Additionally, it may solve logistical challenges at institutions when trying to coordinate performing both marking and surgery under 1 anesthetic event. Studies identifying the patient groups that will derive maximal bene /uniFB01 t from this approach are needed.\nOur study does have its limitations. These include its design as a retrospective, comparative cohort study rather than a prospective, randomized controlled study and the potential for selection bias. Additionally, the absence of a formal agreed on selection process for patients between institutions may also lead to bias. Selection bias was attempted to be controlled by ensuring that all consecutive patients undergoing ICGF marking from all centers were included and that consecutive unmarked patients were chosen from the time period immediately before a change in surgical approach, rather than by choosing patients at random. There were no signi /uniFB01 cant differences in patient demographics between the 2 groups (Table 1), and the decreased size of the nodules in the ICG-F marked group (Table 2) would have led one to hypothesize that more tissue may need to be removed to ensure that a small, nonvisible, nonpalpable lesion would be appropriately removed. The study is also strengthened by its multicenter design and the elimination of any run-in period, speaking to its broad potential applicability to the evaluation, diagnosis, and management of small PPLs.",

From our experience, bronchoscopic ICG-F marking appears to be a safe and accurate approach to facilitate lung sparing surgery for otherwise undetectable lesions immediately after bronchoscopy or up to 13 days later. Although no increase in hospital length of stay or chest tube duration was identi /uniFB01 ed, there was an increase in surgery duration. The ability for ICGsoaked coils to maintain their /uniFB02 uorescence for multiple days before surgery allows patients without direct access to expert thoracic surgical services to obtain care at centers far from home, with the possibility to improve outcomes. Further studies will\nneed to be performed to determine the optimal patients that would bene /uniFB01 t from this approach.",
