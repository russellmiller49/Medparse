These emergencies can  be  encountered  during  pre-hospital  care,  patient transfer  or  in  the  in-hospital  locations.  Inside  the hospital, majority of AE  are usually  encountered in intensive care unit (ICU), perioperative setting or  emergency  department  (ED).  Situation  is  further complicated by restricted access to the airway, comorbidity  and  unstable  haemodynamic  status. [1,2] Some of the individual emergencies (e.g., trauma, foreign body aspiration, etc.) have been discussed in various contexts in the literature, but comprehensive articles on managing AE are lacking. In this review article, we aim to discuss early diagnosis, correction of the reversible causes and approach to emergency airway management.",

A  ' HEAVEN '  criterion has been  used  as a tool for prediction of  difficult  airway  for  emergency  airway management  in  un  intubated  patients. [12]   It consists  of h ypoxemia, e xtremes  of  sizes, a natomical challenge, v omit/secretions in the pharynx or hypopharynx, e xsanguination and restricted n eck mobility\nb. Plan/options for airway access: Only endotracheal  intubation  and  tracheostomy are the definitive airway devices. Alternate reasonably safe rescue options include SAD and cricothyrotomy.\n· SADs are useful for emergency ventilation, and as an intubation aid,  particularly  in  failed  intubation, accidental extubation and post extubation airway emergency. However,  SAD  may  not  be  useful  in cases  with  infraglottic  pathology  and airway bleeding. Second generation SAD  (LMA  Proseal  and  I-gel)  should be preferred to prevent gastric insufflation. In their absence, the most familiar device should be used.\n· Endotracheal intubation can be facilitated by videolaryngoscope,\nbougie, Bonfil's retromolar scope, etc., depending on the indication, availability and preferences of the anaesthesiologist. Intubation fiberscope, when  used,  will  also  aid  in  diagnosis of  the  condition  while  simultaneously guiding intubation. Last, intubation can be performed through a SAD under the guidance of intubation fiberscope [3,13] · Infraglottic airway techniques include  trans-tracheal  jet  ventilation, cricothyrotomy and tracheostomy. Decision to execute any of these techniques  should  be  taken  quickly and  early  considering  experience  and feasibility  in  the  given  circumstance. All India Difficult Airway Association (AIDAA) recommends a simple effective scalpel bougie technique for emergency airway access. [3 ] Supraglottic  jet  ventilation  is also possible with modified Wie nasal jet or other similar devices and can be lifesaving. [8]   Attempts  to  ventilate  can continue  through  a  SAD  or  facemask during  the  preparation  and  execution of infraglottic invasive techniques.\n· Rigid bronchoscope can be an especially  useful  device  if  the  airway obstruction is distal to the glottis. [14]\n· Cardiopulmonary bypass(CPB) and Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation(ECMO) are lifesaving if available when no other airway technique is successful in maintaining oxygenation, but it needs a prior planning.

There  is  lack  of  consensus  on  best technique for oxygenation and airway instrumentation in emergency  setting due to lack of  randomised controlled trials.  As  an  alternative,  we  suggest  use  of causal  models  with  counterfactual  concepts [36]   (e.g.,\nmarginal  concept  models)  that  will  robustly  infer causal relationship between an intervention and patients' outcome from observation data. Establishing institutional guidelines and DART are additional safety measures that should be considered.\nWe  also  anticipate  wider  role  of  newer  equipment like  videolaryngoscopes,  imaging  modalities  like  3D printing, virtual imaging and ultrasonography during assessment and management of AE in future.",
