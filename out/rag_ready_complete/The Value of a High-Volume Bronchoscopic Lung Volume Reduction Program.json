The development of a dedicated BLVR program requires significant resources, both from an interventional pulmonology (IP) team and from the medical center. The financial value of this program is important to assess to develop a feasible and sustainable plan for providing this service in the future. RESEARCH QUESTION: Can a BLVR program bring value to a medical center in terms of patient referrals, revenue, and contribution margin? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients who were referred for BLVR to the interventional pulmonology clinic at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC). Patient demographics were obtained. Outpatient services used to determine candidacy for endobronchial valve placement were analyzed and revenue was estimated. For patients who had valve placement, revenue from the bronchoscopic procedure and subsequent inpatient hospitalization was calculated and the contribution margin of the procedure was estimated. RESULTS: An estimated total of $1 to 1.4 million in revenue was generated in the workup and placement of endobronchial valves for 37 patients. The total revenue for the care of 52 patients deemed not to be candidates for the valve procedure was $144,000 to $170,000. The contribution margin for the procedure was estimated to be 25%. The median length of stay was 3 days. Among all 89 patients referred for BLVR, 26 referrals were made to other specialties at BIDMC during workup. Of these patients, 69.6% were new patients referred to BIDMC for BLVR. INTERPRETATION: In addition to the established therapeutic benefit of BLVR for patients with COPD, a BLVR program in a dedicated, specialized center is economically valuable and sustainable, attracts referrals from other medical centers and health care systems, and generates internal referrals within the medical center.",

Like other advanced bronchoscopic procedures such as endobronchial ultrasound, the full economic impact of interventional pulmonology (IP) procedures may be underestimated by considering the revenue from the procedure alone. 1 Other aspects of the care of\npatients referred for a procedure need to be included. Additionally, the contribution margin for the care episode including the procedure plus subsequent inpatient hospitalization can be a metric for the sustainability of this program. 2\nThe availability of a highly specialized procedure such as BLVR through endobronchial valve (EBV) placement has the potential to bring new patient referrals into the medical center. Additionally, for all patients referred for BLVR, a comprehensive workup, including outpatient clinic visits, testing, and procedures, is undertaken to determine candidacy for the procedure. Finally, referrals to other specialties (eg, cardiology, thoracic surgery) within the medical center may be warranted based on /uniFB01 ndings of the workup. Therefore, all services used by patients who are referred for EBV must be accounted for when determining the actual value of such a program to a medical center. This study analyzes the value, including revenue prior to (upstream) the BLVR procedure and revenue after (downstream) the procedure, resulting from the implementation of a BLVR program at an expert IP center. We also determine the contribution margin of the BLVR procedure at the medical center.",

Negotiated charges with payers published by BIDMC were used to estimate revenue from these services. 4 Due to the inherent variability of reimbursement, these were estimates of revenue and not exact calculations. For this analysis, the Medicare negotiated rate was used for all patients to provide a conservative estimate of the reimbursement. Clinic charges and professional fees for IP clinic at our center were used. After valve placement, services used by patients were analyzed up to 1 year after the procedure, or until May 15, 2022, as previously mentioned. For the EBV procedure and hospitalization, exact revenue was obtained. Additional outpatient bronchoscopies and EBV placement procedures during the 1-year follow-up were also included in the analysis.\nOnly outpatient workup done to determine EBV candidacy and outcomes postprocedure was used in revenue calculations. Some established patients had numerous pulmonary function tests and radiographic studies. Because our aim was to identify revenue generated due to a BLVR referral speci /uniFB01 cally, we only considered outpatient workup done for EBV candidacy.\nTotal revenue was calculated using the estimates previously described. Minimum and maximum revenue estimates were generated based on assumed variations in clinic billing practices.\nProjected revenue was calculated as a theoretical estimate of revenue for patients who had EBV placement. This calculation assumed that every patient who received EBVs had the following workup: pulmonary function test, arterial blood gas, 6-min walk test, CT chest scan, single-photon emission CT scan (for patients with homogenous disease or those with heterogeneous disease and 2 potential target lobes), transthoracic echocardiogram, and initial clinic visit prior to EBV placement; the EBV placement procedure and hospitalization; and afterward a pulmonary function test, 6-minute walk test, CT chest scan, and follow-up clinic visit. Our projected revenue for patients who did\nnot receive valves assumed that every patient had the following workup: pulmonary function test, 6-min walk test, CT chest scan, transthoracic echocardiogram, and initial clinic visit.\nReferrals made to other specialists in our center during workup for BLVR were recorded, but not included in the revenue analysis.",

      "content": "There were 119 consecutive patient referrals for BLVR within this study period. Of these, 21 patients were excluded because they were still undergoing workup for valve candidacy, were never seen in clinic, or had initial EBV placement at another institution. Of 98 patients who\nwere evaluated in clinic for BLVR, nine were excluded from the economic analysis due to enrollment in another clinical trial for /uniFB01 ssure completion and BLVR. Among the 89 remaining patients, 37 (42%) received valves and 52 (58%) were deemed not candidates. Figure 1 depicts patient inclusion and analysis.\nAmong patients who received valves (n ¼ 37), SVS valves were placed in three patients (8%) and Zephyr valves were placed in 34 patients (92%). Our center was a quaternary academic teaching hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. In this cohort, 25 (68%) were from instate and 12 (32%) were from other states. There were 28 new patients (76%) and nine established patients (24%).\nTwenty-seven percent had non-Medicare health insurance.\nAmong patients who did not receive valves (n ¼ 52), 40 (77%) were from Massachusetts (in-state) and 12 (23%) were from other states (out-of-state). There were 34 new patients (65%) and 18 established patients (35%). Fifty\n]\npercent of patients in this cohort had non-Medicare health insurance. Among all patients, 40% had nonMedicare health insurance. Demographics are summarized in Table 1.\nThe hospital length of stay was calculated for patients who had valve placement. Mean length of stay was 5.3 days (range, 3-24 days), and median length of stay was 3 days (interquartile range, 3-5 days). For the hospital stay after initial valve placement, 27 patients\n(73%) had # 4 days ' length of stay and 10 patients (27%) had > 4 days ' length of stay. Eight patients (22%) underwent $ 1 bronchoscopy for additional valve placements followed by inpatient hospitalization during the 1-year follow-up period. There were 10 additional valve placement procedures followed by inpatient stays. The reasons for repeat procedures were as follows: no atelectasis achieved (n ¼ 5), valve migration (n ¼ 2), and persistent air leak (n ¼ 1); reexpansion of lobe after initial atelectasis (n ¼ 1); and treatment of a contralateral lobe (n ¼ 1). There were 47 total hospital stays for 37 patients. Of all hospital stays, 37 stays (79%) were # 4 days and 10 stays (21%) were > 4 days. The reasons for hospitalization > 4 days include persistent air leak (80%), hypoxemia (10%), and pain requiring IV opiate administration and volume overload (10%). These results are depicted in Figure 2. There were no deaths from the procedure.\nThe average number of procedures and tests that patients had prior to EBV placement are depicted in Table 2. In total, 22 referrals were made to other specialties at BIDMC during workup of these patients. Among patients who did not have EBVs placed, /uniFB01 ve referrals were made to other specialties at our center, including thoracic surgery and pulmonary hypertension clinics.\nFigure 3 shows the revenue from the BLVR program. An estimated total $1.40 to 1.44 million in revenue was generated in the care of 37 patients who received valves. The projected revenue for the group was $1.3 million.

Per patient, this amounted to $3,000 in revenue (projected $2,000 in revenue).\nMost of the revenue from the care of patients who had EBV placement was from the EBV procedure and subsequent inpatient hospitalization. Figure 4 depicts the revenue breakdown from the BLVR procedure plus hospitalization vs outpatient services. The total revenue from EBV procedures and inpatient hospitalizations was about $1.2 million. Cost was estimated to be $900,000 for this care episode. The contribution margin of the procedure with hospitalization was 25%, which amounted to $8,100 per patient.",

      "content": "Our results highlight the /uniFB01 nancial impact of a BLVR program in generating substantial revenue for the hospital. In addition to the established clinical bene /uniFB01 ts of BLVR for patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which include improvements in lung function, quality of life, exercise capacity, and survival, 5-13 the procedure and clinical workup of these patients is economically bene /uniFB01 cial and sustainable for the medical center.\nThe highest revenue was generated from placement of EBVs, amounting to about $1.4 million total or $38,000\nper patient. One of the primary drivers of the revenue for this procedure was reimbursement based on the diagnosis-related group that is determined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The diagnosis-related group for BLVR is that of major chest procedures, which is also used for surgical procedures such as lobectomy. In addition to the procedure and inpatient stay, a comprehensive workup was needed for all patients referred for BLVR to determine candidacy. This workup included clinic visits, pulmonary function tests, and imaging. Outpatient bronchoscopies were sometimes performed as part of the initial workup when necessary to exclude infections and diagnose suspicious nodules. In our analysis, we found that the estimated revenue exceeded the projected revenue. It is important to note that the revenue was a conservative estimate based on negotiated Medicare reimbursement rates. Furthermore, some patients had imaging studies and pulmonary function tests done at outside institutions. These tests were not included in our revenue calculation because they did not generate revenue within our medical center. In institutions where all workup is performed in one medical center, this would generate more revenue.\nIn practice, a medical center that serves as a BLVR center of excellence operates within a larger health care system from which referrals are generated.

It is possible that good-quality testing (eg, updated pulmonary function testing within a year, transmission of thin-slice CT scan images) may decrease repeat testing for some patients. However, CT scans, echocardiograms, and blood gas analysis are not necessarily performed for all patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as routine practice. Because these tests are required for assessment of BLVR candidacy, such testing would need to be performed. Therefore, regardless of effective integration within the health care system, it is likely that new testing is undertaken for BLVR, providing revenue.\nAdditional revenue, not included in this analysis, is also generated from referrals to other specialties within our center in the workup of patients undergoing BLVR. For 37 patients, 22 referrals were made to other specialties, particularly pulmonary hypertension and thoracic surgery. These referrals resulted in additional clinic visits, procedures, and surgeries (eg, right heart catheterization), or enrollment in another clinical trial. Referral to other specialties resulted in optimization of care (eg, diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension with further management, thoracoscopic resection of pulmonary nodules). These additional revenue sources from other subspecialty referrals were not included in our primary economic analysis but are important to note. A subset of patients referred for EBV candidacy workup were found to have incomplete /uniFB01 ssures. These patients were enrolled in a clinical trial in which videoassisted thoracoscopic surgery with intraoperative /uniFB01 ssure completion was performed with EBV placement. Patients who were enrolled in this clinical trial were excluded from our analysis because the economic impact of this procedure is not generalizable to other centers. Finally, although BIDMC does not have its own pulmonary rehabilitation program, in a medical center\nthat has this program, it can be another source of revenue. In summary, the establishment of a BLVR program was key to the referral of patients to our medical center and optimization of their care resulted in additional revenue.\nThe BLVR procedure and hospitalization were estimated to have a favorable contribution margin of 25%. Mahajan et al 2 proposed that the /uniFB01 nancial justi /uniFB01 cation of IP procedures hinges on the contribution margin and thus the sustainability of a procedure. Correlating this metric to EBV placement is not straightforward because the revenue and cost is from the procedure plus the subsequent hospitalization, and both hospital and physician reimbursement are analyzed. Additionally, cost accounting is typically not performed at the procedure and hospitalization level but rather at the aggregate level, as is the case at our center. We therefore used the CCR to estimate costs, a method used previously in health care cost analysis. 14-17 This method may even overestimate costs slightly, which would make our margin estimate even stronger. 18 We acknowledge that cost accounting at the procedure and hospitalization level may provide a more direct measure of cost. However, CCR is a reasonable and reliable method by which to estimate costs because we are analyzing historical data. The CCR for our institution was stable over the 4 years of our data analysis, adding to its reliability. Our favorable margin is sustainable and promotes further growth for the medical center and the IP program to continue care for the patients.\nOne of the ways in which contribution margin was maximized and cost minimized was by shorter inpatient hospital stays and admission to the medical ward rather than the ICU. As per standard practice, patients were observed for at least 3 nights after valve placement due\nto high risk of pneumothorax. Thus, # 4 days ' length of stay of hospitalization was chosen to evaluate how many patients required an extended length of stay. In our analysis, patients spent a mean of 5.3 days and a median of 3 days in the hospital after the procedure. Of all hospital stays, most (79%) were # 4 days in length. As expected, most extended stays were due to persistent air leak. Because the reimbursement based on diagnosisrelated group was independent of length of stay, shorter stays helped minimize cost.\nA potential way to reduce costs of the procedure is utilization of a bronchoscopy suite where minimally invasive procedures can be performed. This setting may reduce cost of the procedure compared with the operating room. Dedicated cost accounting at the procedure level can be implemented to quantify the difference in cost between the operating room and bronchoscopy suite, and the contribution margin can therefore be optimized for a setting that works best at the institutional level. A study by Desai et al 19 shows that an IP suite can be projected to provide consistent pro /uniFB01 t for a range of IP procedures. EBV placement in the bronchoscopy suite may reduce cost and increase the contribution margin.\nBLVR programs bene /uniFB01 t greatly from a dedicated nurse manager or advanced practice provider who can screen patients and coordinate care with a referring physician. For example, records (eg, recent chest CT scan, pulmonary function testing, 6-min walk testing, blood gas analysis, echocardiogram) can be obtained from the pulmonologist or performed at a local medical center prior to referral to IP. The patient can also enroll in pulmonary rehabilitation prior to evaluation. Alternately, a nurse manager or advanced practice provider can review testing that is already done and\nensure completion of the workup that is needed. In addition, an advanced practice provider could see some of the patients for follow-up and allow IP faculty to see more new patients which would facilitate the growth of the practice. This effective coordination of care would minimize redundancy and maximize referrals to the IP clinic for BLVR.\nOur study has limitations. First, it is a single-center retrospective study at an academic center in a large city. These data may not be generalizable to other types of centers. Second, we are unable to calculate exact costs at the patient level. Despite using a previously used methodology and reliable estimates of cost, ultimately these are estimates and not exact numbers. Although revenue generated is known, contribution margin is estimated.",
