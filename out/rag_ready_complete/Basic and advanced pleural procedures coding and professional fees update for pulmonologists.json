This article describes the utility of pleural procedures, the appropriate current procedural terminology coding, and necessary modi /uniFB01 ers.

CHEST 2020; 158(6):2517-2523\nKEY WORDS: coding; pleural procedure; thoracentesis; thoracoscopy\nPleural effusions commonly are encountered in both outpatient and hospital settings. They can be caused by many disease processes that range from infection to malignancy to other in /uniFB02 ammatory issues to /uniFB02 uid balance issues. The types of pleural effusion are categorized based on the composition (transudate vs exudate), size, imaging appearance (simple vs complicated) and underlying cause. Malignant pleural effusion is a commonly encountered complication of advanced malignancy. The incidence of malignant pleural effusion is estimated to be > 150,000 cases/year with many cancer types involved of which lung cancer, breast cancer, and lymphoma are the most common. 1 Overall median survival after diagnosis ranges from 3 to 12 months and is dependent on the type of underlying malignancy, tumor characteristics, the extent of disease,\ncomorbidities, and the composition of pleural effusion. 2-6 Basic pleural procedures such as ultrasound scans and thoracentesis are usually the /uniFB01 rst step in diagnosis or palliation. Medical thoracoscopy or videoassisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), chest tubes, and other interventions often are required for persistent or recurrent pleural effusions. In addition to the knowledge of clinical utility of pleural procedures, it is important to become familiar with and understand current procedural terminology (CPT) 7 coding, necessary modi /uniFB01 ers, and associated work relative value unit (wRVU). 7,8",

Pleural /uniFB02 uid aspiration is carried out with the use of aseptic precautions. There is no increased risk of bleeding due to mild-tomoderate coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia.

Medical thoracoscopy differs in some ways from VATS in that it is performed in an endoscopy room or OR, typically with local anesthesia and/or moderate sedation and single port and by a pulmonologist or surgeon. Both medical thoracoscopy and VATS allow for direct visualization and biopsy of suspicious pleural abnormalities, such as nodularity, masses, and thickening. Due to lower than accepted diagnostic rates for blind closed pleural biopsy, with or without pleural /uniFB02 uid cytologic evidence, a visualized directed pleural biopsy via medical thoracoscopy or VATS may be needed. 22 Medical thoracoscopy with local anesthetic has low of complication and mortality rates, despite the invasiveness of the procedure. Mortality rate related to\nmedical thoracoscopy alone is approximately 0.34%, as reported by Rahman et al, 22 and may be linked to complications associated with talc. Major complications that included empyema, hemorrhage, port site tumor growth, bronchopleural /uniFB01 stula, postoperative pneumothorax or air leak, and pneumonia were reported in 1.8% of cases. 23 Thoracoscopy is an invaluable diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of pleural mesothelioma, especially considering the even lower diagnostic rate of pleural /uniFB02 uid cytologic evidence alone (26% to 32%). 21,24,25",

The patient has multiple comorbidities, and a moderately complex consultation is done (evaluation and management CPT code 99254). As part of the evaluation, it is decided that there is a pleural effusion that needs drainage the same day.

This is billed separately using the modi /uniFB01 er ' -57 ' (Decision for Surgery).

It does not include a patient ' s room, a minor treatment room, a recovery room, or an ICU (unless the patient ' s condition was so critical that there would be insuf /uniFB01 cient time for transportation to an OR).\nIf a less extensive procedure fails and a more extensive procedure is required, the second procedure is payable separately.\nprocedures that may be expected more commonly to be performed during the same session.\nIf the procedure is done as part of multiple procedures at the same time or day, a 51 modi /uniFB01 er is used to note the distinct procedure, which indicates that multiple procedures were performed at the same session. That is, it applies to different procedures performed at the same session (example: thoracentesis and bronchoscopy on the same day).\nModi /uniFB01 er 59 is used for a distinct procedural service. Modi /uniFB01 er 59 indicates that a procedure is separate and distinct from another procedure on the same date of service. Typically, this modi /uniFB01 er is applied to a procedure code that ordinarily is not paid separately from the /uniFB01 rst procedure but should be paid per the speci /uniFB01 cs of the situation. Example: Modi /uniFB01 er 59 is applied when separate biopsies are performed on different anatomic sites or lesions during the same procedure or separate incision or different session\nThe 26 modi /uniFB01 er is used when one needs to separate out the professional from the facility-based technical component of a procedure. Examples used in this section are of ultrasound imaging where clinical decisions are interpreted and made based on the image; however, the facility owns the equipment.\nModi /uniFB01 er 22 is used for a procedure that is more complex than typical and represents substantially increased time to perform the service. It rarely is reimbursed and is carrier-dependent.\nModi /uniFB01 er 50 is used for bilateral procedures that are not described inherently as bilateral.
