    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Each year, millions of pulmonary nodules are identified incidentally or through lung cancer screening, and many involve biopsy to distinguish cancer from benign processes. Both navigational bronchoscopy and computed tomography–guided transthoracic needle biopsy are commonly used in patients undergoing biopsies of peripheral pulmonary nodules, but the relative diagnostic accuracy of these two approaches is unclear.\nMETHODS In this multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, noninferiority trial, we assigned patients with an intermediate-risk or high-risk peripheral pulmonary nodule measuring 10 to 30 mm in diameter to undergo navigational bronchoscopy or transthoracic needle biopsy at seven centers across the United States. The primary outcome was diagnostic accuracy, which was defined as the percentage of patients with biopsies that showed a specific diagnosis (cancer or a specific benign condition) that was confirmed to be accurate through 12 months of clinical follow-up (nonferiority margin, 10 percentage points). Secondary outcomes included procedural complications such as the occurrence of pneumothorax.\nRESULTS Among the 234 patients included in the primary-outcome analysis (5 of whom were lost to follow-up), biopsy resulted in a specific diagnosis that was confirmed to be accurate through month 12 in 94 of 119 patients (79.0%) in the navigational bronchoscopy group and in 81 of 110 patients (73.6%) in the transthoracic needle biopsy group (absolute difference, 5.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, −6.5 to 17.2; P=0.003 for noninferiority; P=0.17 for superiority).

      "content": "M illions  of  pulmonary  nodules are identified annually, and many involve biopsy to distinguish cancer from benign  processes. 1-3 Transthoracic  needle  biopsy and navigational bronchoscopy are techniques for biopsy of peripheral pulmonary nodules. Transthoracic needle biopsy is guided by intraprocedural three-dimensional computed tomographic (CT) images. This technique provides an accurate diagnosis in up to 90% of cases but involves  the  passage  of  a  needle  through  the chest wall and pleura, which has been reported to cause pneumothorax in up to 25% of cases. 4-8 During  navigational  bronchoscopy,  biopsy  of nodules is performed with the use of catheters that are guided through peripheral airways on the basis of CT images obtained before the procedure, without involvement of the pleurae. This method has been found to cause pneumothorax in 2% of cases. 9   However, navigational bronchoscopy has historically relied on the use of intraprocedural  two-dimensional  fluoroscopy, and diagnostic accuracy has been reported to be as low as 38%, with a pooled estimate of accuracy of 70% in previous meta-analyses. 9-12 In the past several years, intraprocedural threedimensional imaging (digital tomosynthesis and cone-beam CT) has been integrated with navigational bronchoscopy platforms, and this combination has resulted in diagnostic accuracy that is similar to that of transthoracic needle biopsy in some studies. 13-16\nEstimates  of  diagnostic  accuracy  for  both navigational bronchoscopy and transthoracic needle biopsy have been derived from single-group studies that had a high risk of selection, referral, and publication biases. 4,11  Randomized trials comparing navigational bronchoscopy with transthoracic needle biopsy are lacking.\nTo compare the effect of navigational bronchoscopy with that of transthoracic needle biopsy  on  diagnostic  accuracy  in  patients  undergoing  biopsy  of  a  peripheral  pulmonary nodule, we conducted the VERITAS (Navigation  Endoscopy  to  Reach  Indeterminate  Lung Nodules  versus  Transthoracic  Needle  Aspiration) trial. We hypothesized that the diagnostic accuracy  of  navigational  bronchoscopy  would be noninferior to that of transthoracic needle biopsy.",

      "content": "Patients assigned to undergo navigational bronchoscopy underwent electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy with integrated digital tomosynthesis (Illumisite fluoroscopic navigation platform, Medtronic). 13 The procedures were planned on the basis of a CT scan obtained within 3 months before the procedure. Bronchoscopy was performed, with the patient under general anesthesia, by an interventional pulmonologist with access to radial endobronchial ultrasound imaging for confirmation of localization of the nodule and rapid onsite cytologic assessment for assessment of the adequacy of the biopsy specimen. The use of digital tomosynthesis was encouraged when the initial radial ultrasound image suggested that the biopsy\ncatheter  was  not  pointed  at  the  center  of  the nodule. The types of biopsy tools used and the number of biopsies performed with each tool were at the discretion of the proceduralist. Fluoroscopy was used to assess for pneumothorax immediately after the procedure.\nPatients  assigned  to  undergo  transthoracic needle biopsy underwent CT-guided transthoracic needle biopsy under local anesthesia with moderate sedation or under general anesthesia, in accordance with local institutional protocols and clinician and patient preferences. Biopsies were performed by interventional radiologists with  the  use  of  dedicated  interventional  CT scanners. The number of biopsies, the size and type of biopsy needle, whether rapid on-site cytologic examination was performed, and the method  of  assessment  for  pneumothorax  after  the procedure were at the discretion of the proceduralists.\nPatients who were found to have cancer on biopsy were referred for oncologic treatment. Patients  in  whom  cancer  was  not  identified underwent  guideline-recommended  follow-up by treating clinicians who managed all care after the biopsy, including any decision to pursue additional invasive diagnostic procedures and cadence of follow-up imaging.",

Specimens that  were  found  to  be  nonmalignant  on  local review underwent central review by a thoracic pathologist who was unaware of the trial-group assignments. A central committee of three experts in pulmonary nodules, all of whom were also  unaware  of  the  trial-group  assignments, reviewed data regarding all the biopsies that had been interpreted locally as nonmalignant to adjudicate whether the biopsy was diagnostic or\nnondiagnostic. These data included the local and central pathological interpretations and preprocedural clinical records. A specific benign diagnosis required consensus among the three experts;  cases  in  which  consensus  could  not  be reached were adjudicated as nondiagnostic.\nResearch personnel reviewed medical records for subsequent invasive procedures and CT scans. Records were monitored until there was a change in the presumed diagnosis of a nonmalignant lung nodule, until regression or resolution of the nodule was seen on subsequent scans, or for at least 12 months if the nodule remained stable on repeat CT scans.",

In patients whose procedure was cancelled on the day of the procedure for any other reason except safety (e.g., the patient presented with a new unstable arrhythmia), the intervention was considered to be nondiagnostic, as were any procedures that were started but not completed.\nThe secondary outcomes included diagnostic yield (defined as the percentage of patients with biopsies that were considered to be diagnostic without consideration of clinical follow-up), a confident clinical diagnosis (defined as a diagnosis that was based not only on the nodule biopsy  but  also  on  additional  sampling  procedures, such as lymph-node biopsies, that were performed at the time of the nodule biopsy), procedural complications (including safety outcomes such as the occurrence of pneumothorax), duration of the procedure, procedural and radiologic features associated with diagnostic yield, need for subsequent nodule biopsy or staging procedure, and radiation exposure.

Noninferiority of navigational bronchoscopy was tested with the use of a z-test, with a noninferiority margin of 10 percentage points. Details of the rationale for the noninferiority margin are provided in the Supplementary  Appendix.  The  diagnostic  accuracy of transthoracic needle biopsy was assessed at 90%, with a one-sided type I error rate of 5%. Therefore,  a  sample  size  of  112  patients  per group would give the trial 80% power to determine noninferiority. Under the assumption of 15% attrition, the total sample size was calculated to be 258 patients (129 per group). No interim analysis was performed because both biopsy techniques are used in routine clinical care, and adjudication of the primary outcome required 12 months.\nAll the patients who had undergone randomization were included in the analyses, with the following exceptions: patients who had undergone  additional  imaging  between  randomization  and  the  trial  intervention  that  showed results  that  made  them ineligible (e.g.,  repeat imaging that showed nodule growth to >30 mm or new nodal disease for which biopsy was indicated), patients who did not report for their scheduled trial intervention, patients whose procedure was cancelled owing to clinical instability before the initiation of the trial intervention,  and  patients  with  missing  data  on  the primary outcome.\nWe examined whether prespecified  baseline variables modified the effect of trial-group assignment on the primary outcome using a logisticregression  model  with  the  trial-group  assignment,  the  proposed  effect  modifier,  and  the interaction between the trial-group assignment and the proposed effect modifier as independent variables. Prespecified potential effect modifiers included nodule location (outer third vs. middle third of the lung), calculated probability of cancer (≤50% vs. >50%), nodule size (≤15 mm vs.\n>15 mm in diameter), and presence or absence of  the  bronchus  sign.  The  bronchus  sign  is  a finding seen on CT that is characterized by a peripheral bronchus that terminates in or extends through a lung nodule.\nThree  sensitivity  analyses  of  the  primary efficacy outcome were performed. One analysis included all the patients who had undergone randomization, regardless of whether they underwent  the  randomly  assigned  intervention; patients who did not undergo a trial intervention were classified as not having met the criteria for the primary outcome. In a second analysis, the outcomes of patients who were lost to follow-up before month 12 and had a specific benign diagnosis on the basis of the biopsy were considered to be either all true negative for cancer or all false negative for cancer. A third analysis included only patients who underwent biopsy of the target nodule; patients whose biopsy was cancelled owing to nodule regression seen on imaging performed on the day of the intervention (before the start of the procedure) and those whose proceduralist declined to perform  the  procedure  were  excluded  from  the analysis.\nBetween-group differences in the secondary outcomes are reported as point estimates and 95% confidence intervals. The widths of the confidence  intervals  were  not  adjusted  for multiplicity  and  should  not  be  used  to  infer definitive  differences  in  the  intervention  effects between the two groups.

The most common reason for exclusion was  having  a  separate  clinical  indication  for bronchoscopy. Among the patients who provided written informed consent, 30 were ineligible for randomization: 20 did not meet the criteria for undergoing a trial intervention after central re-\nview of imaging, 5 had new imaging results that met an exclusion criterion, and 5 withdrew consent.

      "content": "The diagnostic accuracy of navigational bronchoscopy was noninferior to that of transthoracic needle biopsy among patients undergoing biopsy of a peripheral pulmonary nodule. Complications were less common during navigational bronchoscopy.\nEarly diagnosis of lung cancer, which often involves biopsy, offers the best chance for cure. Methodologically rigorous estimates of the accuracy and safety of available methods of biopsy are needed to inform the care of patients with indeterminate pulmonary nodules. The results of this trial suggest that navigational bronchoscopy, which elicited diagnostic accuracy similar to that of transthoracic needle biopsy but with fewer complications, should be the procedure of choice for biopsy of indeterminate lung nodules that appear to be technically amenable to both approaches.\nThe  diagnostic  performance  of  navigational bronchoscopy in this trial was similar to that seen in previous studies that used the same technique, in which diagnostic accuracy ranging from 77 to 83% was reported. 13-16 In this trial, transthoracic needle biopsy performed worse than previously reported. However, the typically higher estimates of diagnostic accuracy with transthoracic needle biopsy derive from noncomparative, and often retrospective, studies with a high risk of  bias  that  used  a  variety  of  outcome  definitions. 4,11,23  In addition, the median nodule size in this trial was relatively small, at 15 mm; the diagnostic performance of transthoracic needle biopsy has been reported to be notably lower when targeting smaller nodules. 5,24,25\nThis trial has several strengths. First, patients were screened for eligibility when they were referred for navigational bronchoscopy or transthoracic needle biopsy, which mitigated the risk of referral bias. Second, patients were recruited at academic and community centers across different geographic regions, and therefore, the trial  involved  a  representative  sample  of  physicians and patients, which strengthens the generalizability of these results (see Table S1). Third, an independent panel adjudicated the technical feasibility of both biopsy methods to ensure that both were suitable options and to limit selection bias.  Fourth,  the  pathologists  and  pulmonary nodule  experts  who  adjudicated  the  primary\noutcome were unaware of the trial-group assignments, thus minimizing observer bias, and there was minimal loss to follow-up with respect to the primary outcome. Fifth, a conservative approach was used to define the primary outcome, and the resulting final definition conformed to current recommendations. 23  Lastly, multiple prespecified sensitivity analyses of the primary outcome were performed; all the analyses corroborated the results of the main analysis, which\nshowed the noninferiority of navigational bronchoscopy to transthoracic needle biopsy.\nThis trial also has several limitations. First, although both academic centers and community centers were included, navigational bronchoscopy was performed by experienced pulmonologists, so these results may not generalize to centers with less expertise. Second, it was not practicable to conceal the trial-group assignments from proceduralists  or  patients,  although  outcome\nadjudication was blinded. Third, patients with nodules that were considered not to be accessible by transthoracic needle biopsy, navigational bronchoscopy, or both methods, as well as those with nodules in the inner third of the lung, were excluded. However, these exclusions accounted for only 20 of 288 (6.9%) provisionally eligible patients; these results suggest that our findings generalize to the majority of nodules referred for biopsy. Fourth, rapid onsite cytologic evaluation was used more commonly during navigational bronchoscopy than during transthoracic needle biopsy; whether this finding affects the diagnostic accuracy of these approaches is uncertain and should be the focus of future trials. Fifth, although  cases  of  pneumothorax  overall  and  of pneumothorax that resulted in hospital admission or the placement of a chest tube (or both) were each more common in the transthoracic needle biopsy group, these outcomes could have been influenced by the universal use of cross-\nsectional  imaging  in  the  transthoracic  needle biopsy group and by differences in practice patterns regarding hospitalization on the basis of clinical specialty. Sixth, the results of the subgroup  analysis  of  the  primary  outcome  performed according to trial site showed that trial site  did  not  modify  the  effect  of  the  biopsy method on diagnostic accuracy, although small samples at some sites limited this analysis. Seventh,  cost  effectiveness  was  not  assessed  and should be the topic of future trials. Lastly, for patients in whom same-day preprocedural imaging showed substantial regression of the nodule, the assigned intervention was considered to be diagnostic in the primary analysis; a sensitivity analysis excluding these patients did not change the results. Diagnostic regression that was seen on the day of the biopsy was more common with transthoracic needle biopsy - a finding that potentially biased results in favor of this method and thus strengthens the finding that naviga-\n* The difference is reported in percentage points.

Such imaging was required to be related to the biopsy method (e.g., scout CT that was intended to inform transthoracic needle placement or chest CT that was used for navigational bronchoscopy planning in patients who had not recently undergone CT).\n‡‡   The procedure was started, but no biopsy specimens were ultimately obtained (e.g., owing to a complication).\n§§ The proceduralist declined to proceed despite the fact that the patient had a nodule that had been peer-adjudicated as technically feasible and the patient was medically suitable for biopsy.\n¶¶   Patients whose procedures were cancelled because same-day imaging showed regression and those whose proceduralist declined to perform the procedure on the day of the procedure are not included.\n∥∥    The fluoroscopes that were used to perform two-dimensional fluoroscopy for navigational bronchoscopy and the CT scanners that were used for transthoracic needle biopsy reported the radiation dose in different units: dose-length product (in mGy·cm 2 ) for navigational bronchoscopy and dose-area product (in mGy·cm) for transthoracic needle biopsy. The units could not be converted; therefore, a direct comparison of the two trial groups with respect to median radiation exposure could not be made.",
