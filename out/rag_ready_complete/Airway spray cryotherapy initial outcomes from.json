Spray cryotherapy (SCT) uses a noncontact system to deliver liquid nitrogen (2 to 4 psi) through an endoscopic catheter. Rapid freezing and thawing of tissue causes cellular death and is also hemostatic. We report the preliminary results from 6 institutions in which SCT was used for the treatment of malignant airway tumors.\nMethods.

SCT can be used in patients with highly vascular tumors, with reduced bleeding complications and a low overall complication rate.

Although the potential benefit of SCT is considerable, this needs to be confirmed in larger studies.\n(Ann Thorac Surg 2012;94:199-204) © 2012 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons\nM alignant airway tumors (MAT) cause significant morbidity and mortality. In non-small cell lung cancer alone, up to 30% of patients can have central airway obstruction due to MAT [1]. These lesions often lead to shortness of breath, postobstructive pneumonia, hemoptysis, and ultimately, respiratory failure and death. Life expectancy with untreated symptomatic MAT is typically 4 to 8 weeks.\nTreatment of these lesions is difficult. A variety of local modalities are used, including mechanical debridement, laser, argon plasma or electrocautery ablation, endoluminal brachytherapy, photodynamic therapy, and stents. Spray cryotherapy (SCT) is a new modality with encouraging results in the treatment of esophageal lesions, including esophageal cancer [2-6]. It uses a noncontact low-pressure (2 to 4 psi) spray of liquid nitrogen to induce cell death. Initial reports suggest that SCT is safe\nand effective in the management of benign stenoses of the airway [7-9]. Little data exist regarding the use of SCT for MAT. This report describes early multi-institutional experience with SCT for the treatment of MAT.",

      "content": "We conducted a retrospective review of patients treated for MAT at 6 institutions known to use SCT. The study excluded patients with benign strictures. Patients who had other treatment modalities at the same time as SCT were included. All data were deidentified before collection and entered into Excel software (Microsoft Corp, Redmond, WA), for analysis. Patient demographics were collected.\nAirway obstruction was graded in quartiles: 25% or smaller, 26% to 50%, 51% to 75%, and exceeding 75% before and after treatment, using an estimate of crosssectional area to determine the percentage of obstruction.\nDrs Sarkar, Krimsky, and Fernando disclose that they have financial relationships with CSA Medical.\nComplications were recorded and graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 (http://ctep. cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html). Permission from the Institutional Review Boards at each participating center was obtained for this study.\nSCT was performed with the CryoSpray Ablation System (CSA System, Model CC2-NAM, CSA Medical Inc, Baltimore, MD) through a 7F disposable catheter. The catheter is advanced to the target tissue using the working channel (minimum 28-mm diameter) of a therapeutic flexible bronchoscope. This device is approved for use through an endoscope with an active decompression tube. The use of this device through a bronchoscope is considered off-label because only passive venting of the gas is used.\nAdequate venting of the gas is required due to the rapid expansion of nitrogen as it undergoes a phase change from a liquid to a gas (liquid-to-gas expansion ratio 1:694). This is confirmed during treatment with SCT by visualization of the gas exiting the airway, feeling the gas, and by hearing the gas escaping. Also, continued chest expansion is an indication of retained gas even if venting is confirmed. Any indication of inadequate venting aborted the SCT.\nThe application of SCT is usually performed under general anesthesia, although some patients were treated with sedation alone. Rigid bronchoscopy, endotracheal intubation, and laryngeal mask airway is used for patients undergoing general anesthesia. The flexible bronchoscope is advanced into the airway and used to direct the SCT toward the tissue to be treated. Ventilation is held during the period of SCT. An open circuit is confirmed in all patients before treatment. Cuff deflation of the endotracheal tube and detachment of the ventilator is used for all methods of ventilation. If unable to confirm an open circuit, SCT was aborted and an alternative approach to maintaining adequate venting was used.\nThe length of the SCT is determined by the amount of time the tissue is more than 50% frozen. Visible mucosal frost formation was used as a surrogate for frozen tissue, and the cycle started once this reached 50% of the local area view from the flexible bronchoscope. Most SCTs lasted 5 seconds, though some initial treatments were longer. Complete visible thaw of the tissue (complete resolution of frost), with a minimum of a 30-second\nwaiting period between treatments, is required before proceeding to the next treatment. The number of treatments was determined by each physician. This procedure was standard and uniform amongst the physicians participating in this study, with slight variations in the total number of spray treatments and the number of airway sites treated during the same procedure.",

      "content": "From July 2008 to September 2010, 80 patients underwent 114 SCT treatments at 6 institutions. Patients were a median age of 66 years (range, 15 to 90 years), and 45 (56%) were male. More than 70% of the patients had stage IV carcinoma at the time of treatment. Median operative time was 65 minutes (range, 15 to 176 minutes; Table 1). By the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, 87% of patients were 3 or 4, and no patient was assessed as ASA 1. Two patients presented with benign disease that was behaving in a malignant fashion.\nMetastatic lesions were the most common disease treated with SCT (Table 2). Comorbid conditions were present in 60 patients (75%) and included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, postobstructive pneumonia, and diabetes (Table 3). Patients presented with shortness of breath, dyspnea on exertion, cough, or hemoptysis.\nSignificant dyspnea was the most common presenting symptom.\nData on airway occlusion were available in 83 of the procedures performed. Pretreatment airway occlusion was graded as more than 75% in 74% of patients, but only 8 patients had more than 75% narrowing after treatment (Fig 1). Luminal patency was not achieved in 1 patient after treatment (100% pretreatment and posttreatment occlusion). Most patients underwent another form of endobronchial treatment at the time of SCT, most often mechanical debridement through a rigid scope and biopsy forceps.\nSignificant bleeding ( > 50 mL) occurred in only one treatment and was treated successfully with SCT to control the bleeding. All other patients had minimal ( < 20 mL) blood loss during the SCT and debridement procedures. No transfusions were given in the perioperative period for blood loss during the procedure.\nConscious sedation was used for 16 SCT procedures (14%). Rigid bronchoscopy was used in 52 SCT procedures (46%), and flexible bronchoscopy was used in 100% of patients. SCT was performed as an outpatient procedure in 58%.\nOf the patients who were admitted after SCT, 33 (69%) were admitted to a standard hospital floor and 13 (27%) were admitted to intermediate level care or to the intensive care unit. All but 3 of these patients were discharged home, for a 95.6% discharge rate (109 of 114 procedures led to discharge).\nComplications occurred in 22 of 114 procedures (19.3%), with 1 patient having complications during 2 separate procedures. Most complications were intraoperative and self-limiting, including hypotension, bradycardia and tachycardia, and desaturation (Table 4). A pneumothorax in 1 patient required chest tube placement. An analysis of tumor location and complications found no correlation between tumor location and type or incidence of complications (data not shown). Complications in 10 patients (8.8.%) were grade 3 or greater,\nincluding 5 deaths (4.4%). Two of these deaths were intraoperative. Three additional patients, who were transitioned to comfort care postoperatively (do not resuscitate/do not intubate palliative care only), died of respiratory failure at 1, 5, and 7 days after the procedure.\nThe intraoperative deaths were in patients, aged 79 and 55 years, with stage IV non-small and small cell lung cancers, and both were ASA 4 classification. One had coronary artery disease and both were former smokers. Neither death occurred during the SCT treatment, but occurred within 5 to 30 minutes after SCT was administered. There were no other preoperative or intraoperative factors that were similar between these patients.\nIn addition, there was one emergency chest tube placement, one airway tear during rigid mechanical debridement (no intervention required), one massive hemoptysis during mechanical debridement (treated successfully with SCT), and one cardiac arrest. The patient who had the intraoperative cardiac arrest was successfully resuscitated and discharged from the hospital after a brief stay in the intensive care unit.\nThe patients who had intraoperative arrest or death\n>75%\nhad very similar preceding events, including profound bradycardia (10 to 20 beats/min), ST segment changes, hypoxemia, and ultimately, pulseless electrical activity arrest. Two of the patients were noted to have very low end-tidal carbon dioxide after reintubation, and there was concern for pulmonary embolism. The patient who survived had a myocardial infarction with no change in heart function by echocardiography.",

      "content": "SCT applies liquid nitrogen directly to the tissue with a noncontact low-pressure delivery system. The ability to deliver liquid nitrogen ( -196°C) directly to the tissues allows for rapid freezing of the tissue, can be used to treat large areas rapidly, and provides uniform treatment. Its efficacy in the treatment of premalignant and malignant esophageal disease has been promising and suggested that similar results might be achieved in the treatment of MAT [2, 3, 6-8]. This report outlines the initial experience with SCT for the treatment of MAT.\nTreatment of MAT has been shown to improve quality of life and survival, especially if undertaken before the onset of morbid symptoms [1, 9-11]. Most other modalities used to treat MAT have significant drawbacks. Laser therapy requires the patient to tolerate oxygen levels of less than 40% to reduce the risk of airway fires. SCT has no risk of airway fire and can be used in patients who require 100% oxygen therapy, which is common in these patients.\nMechanical debridement can often lead to significant airway hemorrhage, especially in highly vascular tumors such as renal cell carcinoma. The ability of laser therapy to control moderate to large airway hemorrhage is poor due to the scatter of the energy with large amounts of blood and the need to localize the bleeding, which is often difficult. Contact cryoprobes have an increased incidence of hemorrhage, some requiring bronchoscopic blocker placement for control [12]. SCT has hemostatic properties [13], and given that its effects are over a large area, one does not need to localize beyond the airway from which the bleeding emanates. SCT successfully controlled bleeding in 1 patient who had massive hemoptysis after mechanical debridement of a tumor. If this effect of SCT can be confirmed in larger studies, it may become a vital tool in patients with difficult to control hemoptysis.\nFurthermore, laser therapy is relatively contraindicated in complete airway obstruction and is contraindicated in and around implants, such as stents, where there is a risk of ignition. Some physicians observed immediate tumor shrinkage after treatment with SCT, allowing navigation beyond the tumor and facilitating tumor debulking. In addition, SCT is safe to use in and around implants, such as stents, because there is no risk of ignition.\nWith rapid expansion of the liquid nitrogen into gas, the risk of pneumothorax was initially considered to be significant, but this did not seem to be the case in this cohort of patients. Pneumothoraces occurred in 3 pa-\ntients, with only 1 requiring chest tube placement. With the rigid adherence to the outlined protocol for venting of gas, the risk of pneumothorax was 2.6%, and symptomatic pneumothorax was only 0.9%, which is similar to the incidence during jet ventilation and other interventional bronchoscopic procedures [10, 14].\nIn addition, a number of patients appeared to have durable results, including a number who had prior treatment with other ablative modalities without particular success. Several patients were noted to have complete regression of tumors, including a patient who had complete mucosal regrowth after treatment of an occluding left mainstem tumor. This cohort of patients does not have enough data to comment on this specifically, and again, a larger study is needed to confirm this observation. Durability of response would be of significant use in patients who no longer have other treatment options.\nOverall, the outcomes in these patients were similar to other cohorts treated for MAT [9, 10, 15-17]. Intraoperative problems are expected in this population of patients with multiple comorbidities, decreased functional status, and respiratory status that is often very marginal. Severe intraoperative complications occurred in 4 patients in this cohort that seemed to be related to cardiovascular compromise, including bradycardia, hypoxemia, and pulseless electrical activity arrest. As such, before SCT is used on a widespread basis, caution must be used. To that end, we presently recommend that Investigational Review Board approval or a separate consent be obtained if SCT is to be undertaken.\nFurther studies to gain a better understanding of the mechanism by which these complications may be occurring are warranted. Increased surveillance of patients intraoperatively, including arterial catheter placement should be considered.\nThe ability to determine which patient will have a significant complication from any airway procedure is very important, especially in this patient population. Preoperative and intraoperative factors associated with significant complications, including death, would help in the decision of who should be taken to the operating room. Razi and colleagues [17] suggested that patients with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 4 had no real benefit from treatment of MAT. In the current study, ASA classification did not predict perioperative complications (data not shown). Any future studies that evaluate this patient population should focus on factors that will help predict outcomes and optimize patient selection.\nIn conclusion, SCT can be used in patients who require oxygen levels exceeding 40%, in highly vascular tumors with reduced bleeding complications, and has a low overall complication rate that is similar to other endoluminal treatments. SCT is often used in conjunction with mechanical debridement, with excellent luminal patency rates. Caution is needed before SCT is used on a widespread basis, given the intraoperative complications. Although the potential benefit of SCT is considerable, this needs to be confirmed in larger studies.",

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "content": "DR RAFAEL S. ANDRADE (Minneapolis, MN): It was a very nice presentation. It was a nice series of patients. The question I have is the average operative time was pretty long, 76 minutes, and in our own personal experience, if we do a rigid bronchoscopy for coring out or laser, it's usually 15-minute cases. Can you elaborate a little on that?\nDR FINLEY: Yes. Actually, that was one thing that struck me when we were looking through the data, and what I found was that the majority of these patients had more than one tumor treated. About 3 tumors in most of these patients were treated, and there was significant disease burden. And then about 50% of them had to be stented due to external compression.\nSo it wasn't just a simple coring that we go through. The spraying itself, the majority of the patients had about five 5-second cycles, so the spray cryotherapy itself adds a minimal amount of time on to the total procedure.\nDR ANDRADE: And my second question was when you have compared other modalities, such as rigid or laser, for instance, how does this mortality compare with those procedures?\nDR FINLEY: I don't have all of the mortality data. There's more procedures that have been done nationally, and we don't have all of these data, so I don't have the exact numbers. But from what I have here, it is equivalent in terms of mortality for doing rigid bronchoscopy. Actually, if you look at some of the older data from the '80s, any kind of airway tumor has a 30-day mortality up to 20% when dealt with. So the mortality here that we have, which is about 8%, is much lower than that.\nDR DAVID P. PARK MASON (Cleveland, OH): I think one of the arrests was actually at our own institution. I wasn't there at the time, but I had heard about it, so I don't want to speak too much to the specifics of it other than to say it was felt to be a direct consequence of the technique. It was clearly directly related to the cryotherapy. I think the patient either had a pneumothorax or massive pneumoperitoneum related to the amount and flow associated with the actual application of the treatment. So I have little doubt that those arrests and deaths were also related to this cryo technique. What can we do in terms of rolling this out and increasing the safety component of this therapy?\nDR FINLEY: Exactly. I have actually performed 5 pig experiments, and I am doing my sixth next week. And we are trying to look at the physiologic changes that are going on with both right and left heart catheters, and we are doing ultrasound through a thoracotomy to see whether or not something is going on. So we are trying to get that data. But I agree with you. I think it is directly related. They are sick patients, and I think in the 3 patients who went to comfort care, it had nothing to do with it. It is the intraoperative events that concern me most.\nDR ANDRADE: Just one last question. Do you have a hint of what patients we should avoid to do this on in terms of location, anything?\nDR FINLEY: So that was the thing that I have tried to answer. The ages of the patients have ranged from 40 to 88 years old that have had intraoperative complications, including the hypotension and bradycardia, that did not lead to arrests or other sequela. Tumor locations included pretty much any airway, right\nbronchus intermedius, left main stem, distal left lower lobe, and right lower lobe.\nWe initially thought that it would be secondary to maybe cold on the heart, a vagal response. Clearly this is not what is going on. It has something to do with either the proximity of the spray catheter to the tissue that you are spraying or it is the venting. We know that pneumothoraces can occur. There was one death from a tension pneumothorax during the procedure, but that doesn't seem to be the problem in any of these other deaths. So as I said, we haven't figured it out yet, but that is kind of my plan. And once we figure it out, believe me, I'll let everyone know.\nDR KAZUHIRO YASUFUKU (Toronto, Ontario, Canada): I have just one question. From your own experience in using the spray cryotherapy, how does it compare to other ablative modalities, such as YAG laser. What is your opinion on treating big tumors in the airway? How effective is it?\nDRFINLEY: Dr Bains and Dr Rusch trained me, and you put the rigid scope in and you core the tumor out, and you can get great results. The thing that I have noticed with doing Spray Cryotherapy is that I have had a couple of patients, specifically with renal cell, where instead of spending 45 minutes to an hour trying to clean up all of the blood, you spray the tumor, you core it out, it doesn't bleed. I have also had some patients who have been unable to have treatment any other way, so no radiation or any kind of chemo, and they have had significant prolonged response with really bulky tumors within the mediastinum.\nAnd the last thing is that you always know there are tumors that you can't get to because of the angle. With this technology you can actually spray them, and they have regression over a couple of weeks. So you can spray a left-upper-lobe tumor that is nearly occluding it, and then you come back and see them in 2 or 3 weeks and the tumor is nearly gone. It is actually pretty impressive.",
