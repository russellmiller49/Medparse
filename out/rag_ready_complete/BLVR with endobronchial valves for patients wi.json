For patients with severe homogeneous emphysema, surgery is not an option, and other therapies, such as endoscopic coils, provide only modest lung function bene /uniFB01 ts (5 -7).\nBronchoscopic lung volume reduction with one-way endobronchial valves (EBVs) has emerged as a potential treatment for patients with severe emphysema (8). Unidirectional EBVs are placed with the aim to occlude and collapse hyperin /uniFB02 ated lung regions by allowing trapped air to escape from the targeted lobe while preventing air re /uniFB01 ll during inhalation (9). Post hoc analyses from earlier trials involving EBVs have revealed predictive factors that may help identify those patients who are most likely to bene /uniFB01 t from this procedure. These characteristics include absence of signi /uniFB01 cant collateral ventilation (CV) and complete occlusion of the targeted lobe after valve placement (10 -12). Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs)\nin patients with severe emphysema have demonstrated improved clinical outcomes associated with EBV therapy in the absence of CV (13, 14). Although previous trials included predominantly patients with heterogeneous emphysema (10, 12, 13), subgroup analysis from a prospective single-center study (14) and pooled analysis from two RCTs (15) suggest that lung function and quality-of-life improvements are independent of the degree of emphysema heterogeneity.\nThe feasibility of EBV treatment in patients with severe homogeneous emphysema was initially demonstrated by Eberhardt and colleagues (16), but has not been tested in a prospective randomized trial. The IMPACT (Improving Patient Outcomes by Selective Implantation of the Zephyr EBV) study is the /uniFB01 rst prospective, multicenter, RCT evaluating the safety and ef /uniFB01 cacy of EBV therapy in patients with homogeneous emphysema and consistent assessment of CV.",

      "content": "This randomized, controlled, one-way crossover study (NCT02025205) was conducted at eight sites in Austria (one site), Germany (six sites), and the Netherlands (one site) and was approved by the respective ethics committees at each site. All participating subjects provided written informed consent. Enrollment began in August 2014 and completed in January 2016. The 3-month follow-up for the primary end point was completed in April 2016. A data safety and monitoring board provided study oversight.\nSubjects meeting all inclusion/ exclusion criteria underwent a bronchoscopy procedure under conscious sedation or general anesthesia according to individual institutional sedation protocols. Collateral ventilation was measured with the Chartis system (Pulmonx Corp., Redwood City, CA) as previously described (18 -20). If the primary target had collateral ventilation (CV positive), the secondary target was evaluated for CV status. Subjects who were CV positive in both target lobes were exited from the study. Subjects lacking collateral ventilation (CV negative) in the primary or secondary target lobe were randomized 1:1 to the EBV treatment group or the standard-of-care (SoC) control group. Randomization used a blocked design and concealed envelopes that were opened after CV-negative status had been established from the Chartis assessment (for further information, see the online supplement). On determination of the randomization assignment after the identi /uniFB01 cation of CV-negative status for a target lobe, the bronchoscopy procedure for subjects randomized to the SoC group was terminated and subjects recovered appropriately per institutional standards. Subjects assigned to the EBV group underwent immediate placement of Zephyr endobronchial valves (Pulmonx Corp.) in all segments or subsegments of the target lobe with the intention of lobar occlusion.

      "content": "This is the /uniFB01 rst prospective, multicenter RCT of endobronchial valve therapy in\npatients with severe homogeneous emphysema and absence of collateral ventilation. We found statistically and clinically signi /uniFB01 cant improvements in lung function, exercise capacity, and quality of life associated with EBV therapy compared with usual SoC. Nine of 10 subjects experienced target lobe volume reduction indicating effective occlusion of the target lobe after EBV placement. Signi /uniFB01 cantly more patients in the EBV group had improvements that exceeded the MCIDs for FEV1, SGRQ, RV, and 6MWD 3 months after valve treatment.\nAlthough there are proven bene /uniFB01 ts of LVRS with respect to lung function, exercise capacity, and mortality in patients with (upper lobe -predominant) heterogeneous emphysema, LVRS in homogeneous emphysema has been performed with rather variable success (1, 24, 25). Indeed, results from the National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT) demonstrated increased mortality associated with LVRS in patients with homogeneous emphysema (1).\nThe principle of valve treatment is to block ventilation to the most emphysematous lung and induce atelectasis of the hyperin /uniFB02 ated lobe. Previous studies, primarily targeting patients with heterogeneous emphysema without CV, have shown improvements in respiratory mechanics (26, 27), lung perfusion (28), cardiovascular function (29 -31), and other key outcome measures (11, 13, 18, 32, 33). Similar to LVRS, successful valve treatment in patients with severe emphysema without CV has been associated with improved long-term survival rates in prospective case series (34, 35). Using a pooled analysis from two RCTs of EBV therapy we previously demonstrated clinical bene /uniFB01 ts independent of emphysema heterogeneity (15). The present study con /uniFB01 rms these /uniFB01 ndings in patients with exclusively homogeneous emphysema, albeit functional improvements are of smaller magnitude than in heterogeneous patients (14).

      "content": "improvement in lung function, after LVRS, was the RV/TLC ratio. They hypothesized that if the reduction in FEV1 was due to an increase in RV, then reducing RV by LVR should have a substantial effect on FEV1. They also hypothesized that with signi /uniFB01 cant hyperin /uniFB02 ation, that is, RV/TLC levels of 0.6 and higher, LVRS in homogeneous subjects may become increasingly effective. In our current data set the mean RV/TLC at baseline was 0.68 and the mechanism of action of valves in homogeneous patients, based on the reduction of RV, is consistent with this hypothesis.\nWe speculate that EBV therapy, using the current algorithm of target lobe selection based on emphysema destruction scores and regional perfusion impairments, comes closest to removal of regions with high RV/TLC ratios, which has been related to lung function improvements in\nhomogeneous emphysema (37). Indeed, a previous report suggested that low target lobe perfusion (i.e., perfusion in the target zone) was associated with improved exercise tolerance in patients with emphysema treated with valves (38). More recently, Thomsen and colleagues (39) extended these /uniFB01 ndings to indicate that, particularly in patients with low disease heterogeneity, low target lobe perfusion is crucial to predict clinical bene /uniFB01 ts.\nOther endoscopic techniques aiming at reducing lung volumes in severe homogeneous emphysema are con /uniFB01 ned to either case series or subgroup analysis from a mixed emphysema population (6, 7, 40). A previous study of polymeric lung volume reduction in patients with severe emphysema similarly demonstrated improvements in FEV1 for both homogeneous and heterogeneous\nemphysema; however, the effect size was greater in the latter group (40). More modest effects with respect to FEV1 and 6MWD were also observed in subgroups of patients with homogeneous emphysema who underwent bilateral endobronchial coil therapy (6).\nThe positive outcomes associated with EBV therapy in homogeneous emphysema were accompanied by a higher incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs), predominantly pneumothoraces. Although a pneumothorax may be a surrogate of immediate technical and medium-term clinical success after EBV therapy (41), the bene /uniFB01 ts of this therapy need to be weighed carefully against the associated risk. A pneumothorax after EBV therapy is thought to be due to a rapid shift in lung volumes caused by the rupture of subpleural blebs or bullae of the adjacent\nA\nB\nuntreated lobe and/or parenchymal rupture due to pleural adhesions (23). The observed frequency of pneumothorax in our study is similar to real-life data, ranging between 20 and 25% (32, 42). Consistent with a previous analysis from this group the majority of these events occurred within the /uniFB01 rst 48 hours (41), when the patients were still hospitalized. All the pneumothoraces were managed according to published recommendations, including clinical observation, chest tube placement, and/or valve removal to return the target lobe to its (hyperin /uniFB02 ated) pretreatment state and\npromoting pneumothorax healing by reestablishing pleural contact (23). There were no patient deaths as a result of pneumothorax. However, given the chronic condition and declining state of these patients and limited therapeutic choices, patient preferences may need to be considered when evaluating the risks and associated bene /uniFB01 t of this treatment option. Despite the considerable experience of investigators in this study, there was a low incidence of valve migration that required replacement of the valves. This could be readily\naccomplished because of the ease of removing the EBV valves.\nWe acknowledge some limitations of this study. First, there is no consensus regarding the de /uniFB01 nition of homogeneous emphysema. In the NETT, each lung was visually divided into thirds to de /uniFB01 ne three apical to basal zones. Each zone was compared with the remaining two ipsilateral zones to evaluate heterogeneity (1). However, this method of visual scoring for emphysema severity does not necessarily follow anatomical lobar boundaries. Computerized quantitative measurement\nDefinition of abbreviations : 6MWD=6-minute-walk distance; BODE = body mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnea, and exercise capacity; CAT = Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Assessment Test; CI = confidence interval; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; EBV = endobronchial valve; mMRC = modified Medical Research Council; SGRQ = St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire; SoC = standard of care.\nValues represent means\n6\nSD.\n*Two-sample t test.\n† Wilcoxon signed-rank test.\ntools have enabled more precise scoring of the lung, minimizing the variability seen during the radiologist-dependent visual scoring and allowing for a userindependent result (43). The de /uniFB01 nition of greater than 15% constituting heterogeneity and less than 15% equating to homogeneity\nwas derived from the VENT trial (12), where patients had a median difference in emphysema score between the target and ipsilateral lobes of 15%. Future studies may need to con /uniFB01 rm the usefulness of the target lobe selection algorithm implemented in the present trial. Second, the lack of a sham\nprocedure might have in /uniFB02 uenced subjective measures, such as quality of life and symptom scores, with an unintentional bias. Indeed, the proportion of patients exceeding the MCID for the SGRQ in openlabel (6) and sham-controlled (13) intervention studies in severe emphysema are as high as 28 and 46%, respectively. Using a more stringent cutoff of 8 points for the SGRQ, as proposed in the NETT (1), we observed a more pronounced difference between EBVtreated patients and control subjects. Thus, given the associated improvements in both air /uniFB02 ow obstruction and lung volumes, together with the magnitude of SGRQ improvements reported here, there is a high likelihood of a true treatment-related effect. Third, standardized pulmonary rehabilitation was not performed as part of the pre- and/or postprocedural patient care, which may have contributed somewhat to a variable response in exercise testing results. However, there is no consensus whether pulmonary rehabilitation is needed for the minimally invasive endoscopic LVR procedures. In fact, a study from a real-life\nDefinition of abbreviations : 6MWD=6-minute-walk distance; EBV = endobronchial valve; MCID = minimal clinically important difference; mMRC = modified Medical Research Council; RV = residual volume; SGRQ = St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire; SoC = standard of care. * x 2 test.\n† FEV1 responders were also evaluated using more conventional MCID thresholds of 10% and obtained similar results: greater than Odds ratio (or) equal to 1 10%: 40.5 versus 14.0% (EBV vs. SoC, respectively), P = 0.004.\nDefinition of abbreviations : Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; EBV = endobronchial valve; NA = not applicable; NS = not significant; SAEs = serious adverse events; SoC = standard of care.\n*Serious adverse events were events leading to death or to serious deterioration in health that resulted in a life-threatening illness or injury, a permanent impairment of a body structure or body function, hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment to body structure or body function. †\nFisher's exact test.\nclinical setting demonstrated best outcomes in patients with lowest exercise capacity in the absence of systematic pre- and/or postinterventional rehabilitation (44). Last, the present report provides short-term postprocedural primary outcome data at 3 months. Data from previous randomized controlled valve treatment trials indicate sustained bene /uniFB01 ts in key outcome measures throughout 6 months in the subgroup of patients with homogeneous emphysema (14, 15). Follow-up data from EBV-treated\npatients thus continue to be collected throughout 12 months and will be reported separately.\nIn conclusion, the present report demonstrates that EBV therapy in selected patients with homogeneous emphysema without collateral ventilation results in clinically meaningful bene /uniFB01 ts of improved lung function, exercise tolerance, and quality of life. Given the limited treatment options available for this particular patient population, most notably limitations\nbeyond medical therapy, EBV therapy should be considered in these patients. n\nAuthor disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org.\nAcknowledgment: The authors thank ˚ Asa Nilsson, Ph.D., and the team at Devicia AB (Kungsbacka, Sweden) for providing oversight and data monitoring for this study, and Anders Ljungstr ¨ om, B.A. (Progstat AB, Tumba, Sweden) for performing the statistical analyses.",
