      "content": "Esophageal cancer, a highly aggressive malignancy, ranks among the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide [1]. Its prevalence is particularly increasing in developing countries, accounting for a signi /uniFB01 cant portion of cancer diagnoses [2]. With a global 5-year survival rate of only 20% -30%, patients diagnosed with esophageal cancer frequently develop life-threatening complications that markedly affect their quality of life [3]. The development of an airway esophageal /uniFB01 stula (AEF), which is characterized by an abnormal connection between the esophagus and the airway, is one of the most critical complications [4]. This condition typically arises either as the cancer progresses or secondary to therapeutic interventions, including radiation or chemotherapy.\nAEF can cause severe respiratory complications, including aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure, which complicate management and treatment efforts [5, 6]. Esophageal cancer-related AEF has historically presented signi /uniFB01 cant treatment challenges owing to its complex and fragile nature [7]. The commonly used treatment method is conservative treatment, mainly encompassing supportive care, antibiotics, and nutritional support [8]. Although conservative treatment can help reduce the incidence of complications and improve patients ' quality of life, it frequently does not signi /uniFB01 cantly improve the overall survival prognosis of patients [9]. Moreover, surgery is an option; however, patients with malignant AEF are frequently malnourished and are usually undergoing chemotherapy and/or radiation, making them poor surgical candidates [10].\nAirway stent placement has recently emerged as a promising treatment modality, offering a minimally invasive solution for sealing the /uniFB01 stula and preventing esophageal contents from entering the airway, thereby improving patient outcomes [11 -14]. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical ef /uniFB01 cacy and safety of airway stent placement compared with conservative treatment, particularly in prolonging survival and enhancing the quality of life for patients who developed AEF secondary to esophageal cancer.",

      "content": "This retrospective study analyzed the medical records of patients with esophageal cancer who were diagnosed with AEF over a 7-year period. The cohort comprised patients treated at Henan Provincial People ' s Hospital\nbetween January 1, 2017, and March 1, 2024. A total of 111 patients, each ful /uniFB01 lling the inclusion and exclusion criteria, were included in this study. The following were the inclusion criteria: (1) aged > 18 years, (2) patients who met the World Health Organization diagnostic criteria for esophageal cancer, and (3) esophageal cancer combined with AEF. The following were the exclusion criteria: (1) patients with early stage cancer for which surgery was an option; (2) other types of malignant tumors combined with AEF; (3) other types of esophageal /uniFB01 stula, including esophageal-mediastinal /uniFB01 stula; and (4) patients with incomplete medical records. These criteria ensured that the study population was homogeneous and relevant to the study ' s objectives.\nThe patients were categorized into two groups on the basis of their treatment approach. Fifty patients (45.0%) underwent airway stent placement, including silicone and tract-covered metal stents. The remaining 61 patients (55.0%) received conservative treatments, encompassing supportive care, antibiotics, and nutritional support (Fig. 1). The choice of treatment was determined on the basis of the patient ' s clinical status and the physician ' s expertise. The stent placement group underwent a minimally invasive procedure in which an airway stent was inserted to prevent esophageal content leakage into the respiratory system. Conversely, the conservative care group received noninvasive treatments aimed at symptom management and complication reduction.",

Furthermore, we added the pre-Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) to represent the patient ' s physical condition. These variables were essential for evaluating the baseline characteristics of the patients and comparing treatment outcomes across different subgroups.\nAlong with demographic and clinical data, information regarding each patient ' s medical history, including previous surgery and prior treatments (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy), was gathered to provide context for their overall health status. Complications, including pulmonary infections, stent-related issues, and other adverse events, were meticulously\nrecorded. To ensure accuracy, all data were crossreferenced with the hospital ' s electronic medical records. Patient survival, which was calculated from the date of AEF diagnosis to either death or the last available follow-up, constituted the primary endpoint of this study. The incidence of complications and improvements in the quality of life following treatment were the secondary endpoints.",

In this study, KPS assessments were conducted before and after treatment, emphasizing on changes in scores following intervention. This approach facilitated a detailed evaluation of how treatments affected patients ' daily functioning and overall well-being.\nRegarding the stent placement cohort, KPS scores were recorded immediately before stent insertion and during follow-up visits after treatment. Conversely, the conservative treatment group underwent KPS assessments at regular intervals throughout their follow-up care. Changes in KPS\nscores served as a proxy for measuring the effectiveness of airway stent placement, not only in prolonging survival but also in enhancing the quality of life by alleviating symptoms, including dyspnea, chest pain, and recurrent infections. Key indicators of successful treatment included statistically signi /uniFB01 cant improvements in the KPS scores. Additionally, patient-reported outcomes related to symptom relief and overall comfort were collected through structured interviews when available, further enriching treatment ef /uniFB01 cacy evaluation.",

The majority were males (73.0%), with a mean age of 68 years. Fifty (45.0%) and sixty-one (55.0%) patients received airway stent placement and conservative care, respectively (Table 1). Regarding clinical characteristics, a signi /uniFB01 cant difference in age was noted between the two groups ( p = 0.01); however, age and survival time showed no signi /uniFB01 cant correlation ( p = 0.418).\nThe overall mean survival time for the cohort was 147.4 days; however, signi /uniFB01 cant differences were noted between the two treatment groups. Patients who underwent stent placement had a signi /uniFB01 cantly longer mean survival time (192.5 [95% CI, 151.2 -233.7] days) than those conservatively treated (110.0 [95% CI, 88.1 -131.8] days) ( p < 0.001) (Fig. 2).\nWe analyzed the independent risk factors for survival time in all patients. Male sex ( p = 0.017), late tumor stage ( p = 0.030), pulmonary infection ( p < 0.001), and large /uniFB01 stula ( p < 0.001) were identi /uniFB01 ed as the independent risk factors predicting reduced survival time.

Categorical data, on the other hand, are represented using percentages.\nprevious surgery ( p = 0.005) and high pre-KPS ( p < 0.001) were the independent risk factors prolonging survival time.\nFifty patients with AEF underwent airway stent placement, including 30 who received tract-covered metal stent and 18 who received silicone stent; the stent type did not signi /uniFB01 cantly affect the survival time of patients ( p =0.978). Considering the small sample size, 2 patients who underwent double stent implantation of a tract-covered metal stent combined with a silicone stent were excluded from the analysis.\nFurthermore, the KPS scores, which assess patients ' functional status, signi /uniFB01 cantly improved in the stent placement group, increasing from 48.2 pre-treatment to 57.9 post-treatment ( p = 0.017) (Fig. 3). This enhancement indicates better overall health and functionality following the intervention.\nHowever, 36 patients (72.0%) in the stent placement group developed complications. The most prevalent complication was chest pain (52.8%), followed by cough (27.8%) and stent displacement (5.6%). Despite these concerns, the bene /uniFB01 ts of the intervention with respect to survival and quality of life signi /uniFB01 cantly outweighed the associated risks, rendering airway stent placement a feasible treatment alternative for managing AEF in patients with esophageal cancer.",

      "title": "Discussion",
      "content": "Esophageal cancer, a highly aggressive malignancy, is frequently complicated by the development of AEF, a condition that signi /uniFB01 cantly worsens patient prognosis and quality of life [15, 16]. Traditionally, owing to the advanced stage of the disease at diagnosis and the complexity of the /uniFB01 stulous connections, management strategies for AEF have been limited and challenging [17].\nIn general, patients with malignant AEF have poor physical condition, and most of them are poor candidates for surgery [10, 18, 19]. Furthermore, surgery has been hindered by high morbidity and mortality rates, particularly in patients with advanced disease [20]. Currently, majority of these patients are treated with either interventional or conservative treatments. Conservative treatment, including nutritional support and symptomatic treatment, imposes lower physical demands; however, its effect in prolonging survival or improving the quality of life is limited [21].\nOwing to recent advances, the focus has shifted toward minimally invasive techniques, with airway stent placement emerging as a promising intervention [22, 23]. This method involves inserting a stent for sealing the /uniFB01 stula and preventing the aspiration of esophageal contents into the airway, thereby reducing severe complications, including aspiration pneumonia and respiratory failure [24]. Airway stent placement offers the bene /uniFB01 ts of less\nsurgical trauma, fewer complications, clear curative effect, and treatment is rarely limited by physical conditions [8]. Airway stent placement is a feasible and suf /uniFB01 cient intervention for patients with poor physical condition, unsuitable for surgery, or unwilling to undergo surgery.\nFurthermore, the economic status of several patients and families may in /uniFB02 uence the choice of treatment [25]. However, the cost of stents has signi /uniFB01 cantly decreased. Simultaneously, medical insurance can reimburse the cost of stents, which substantially reduces the economic burden of patients.\nAlthough signi /uniFB01 cant differences were noted in terms of age among the clinical characteristics, we observed no signi /uniFB01 cant relationship between age and survival time through Cox regression, which is consistent with previous research /uniFB01 ndings [26, 27]. Subsequently, considering the large age difference, we conducted a matching analysis, and the results con /uniFB01 rmed the conclusion. Therefore, we believe that age is unlikely to affect the survival time of patients, thereby affecting our experimental results.\nThe key /uniFB01 ndings of this study highlight the clinical signi /uniFB01 cance of airway stent placement as a therapeutic modality for patients with esophageal cancer-associated AEF. The mean survival time of 192.5 days in the stent placement group signi /uniFB01 cantly surpasses the 110.0 days observed in the conservative treatment group. This /uniFB01 nding aligns with previous studies that have indicated the ef /uniFB01 cacy of airway stents in prolonging survival in patients with AEF. A study by Chou et al. reported similar outcomes, where stent placement was associated with extended survival in patients with advanced esophageal malignancies [28]. The ability of stents to effectively seal the /uniFB01 stula and prevent the aspiration of esophageal contents may be a critical factor contributing to the improved survival outcomes observed in our cohort.\nMeanwhile, certain in /uniFB02 uencing factors can in /uniFB02 uence the survival time of patients. The reason why late tumor stage, pulmonary infection, and large /uniFB01 stula size are worse than the other groups remains unclear. As these risk factors may make it dif /uniFB01 cult for the /uniFB01 stula to spontaneously heal, eventually leading to respiratory complications and death, prompt risk strati /uniFB01 cation and diagnostic efforts are required [7]. Meanwhile, patients with high pre-KPS and had previous surgery frequently have a longer survival period, possibly attributed to their superior physical condition. Notably, following the occurrence of a /uniFB01 stula in patients with esophageal cancer, the average life expectancy of females is longer than that of males. Previous studies have also reported similar results, which may be partially attributed to the general survival advantage of females over males due to the in/uniFB02 uence of hormones on in /uniFB02 ammation and immune re-\nsponses [9]. To further investigate this phenomenon, future research may be necessary.\nOf the 50 patients who underwent airway stent placement, the majority received a tract-covered metal or silicone stents. Both stent types effectively occluded the /uniFB01 stulas, thereby improving the patients ' quality of life. The tract-covered metal stent exhibits better adhesion to the airway walls, which can reduce the incidence of migration [11]. However, the tract-covered metal design has a relatively low durability, rendering it prone to metal fatigue and stent fracture [10]. In contrast, silicone stents provide greater durability; however, the shortcoming is that the bolts on the exterior surface of the silicone stent may hinder complete adhesion within the airway lumen, thereby diminishing the stent ' s sealing ef /uniFB01 cacy [29].\nBy mechanically sealing the /uniFB01 stula, the stent effectively curtails the aspiration of esophageal contents into the respiratory tract, thereby mitigating the risk of infections, enhancing respiratory function, and ultimately extending patient survival [30]. The positive impact of stent placement on patients ' overall quality of life is highlighted by the marked improvement in KPS scores [31]. In our study, the therapeutic bene /uniFB01 t of this intervention is further underscored by the statistically signi /uniFB01 cant improvement in KPS scores from 48.2 to 57.9 following stent placement. This improvement in KPS scores indicates enhanced functionality and a better quality of life, which are frequent critical considerations in managing patients with terminal illnesses.\nDespite the notable stent placement-associated bene /uniFB01 ts, acknowledging the complications reported in our study is critical. With 72.0% of patients in the stent placement group experiencing adverse events, including chest pain, respiratory failure, and stent displacement, careful patient selection and monitoring are paramount. Previous studies have documented these complications, suggesting that although stenting is effective, it is not without risks. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach is essential in AEF management, integrating the insights of surgical oncologists, interventional pulmonologists, and palliative care specialists for optimizing patient outcomes while minimizing complications.\nAlthough patients with AEF remain to have poor prognoses, the signi /uniFB01 cant disparity between the stent placement group and those undergoing conservative treatment underscores the potential of stent placement as a standard-of-care intervention for these patients [7, 32, 33]. However, acknowledging that stent placement is not devoid of complications is imperative. The prevalence of chest pain and other post-procedural sequelae highlights the invasive nature of this procedure, necessitating vigilant monitoring for managing these complications. Furthermore, stent displacement is not an uncommon occurrence; it can\nprecipitate critical situations, emphasizing the need for further research into re /uniFB01 ning stent design and placement techniques for mitigating such incidents.",

Furthermore, the analysis of complications relied on clinical documentation, which may not capture all the adverse events experienced by the patients. Future endeavors should include larger patient cohorts and longer follow-up durations to corroborate these /uniFB01 ndings and delve into potential advancements in stent technology.\nEsophageal stents are also an effective tool for /uniFB01 stula closure and AEF treatment; however, for malignant esophageal stent AEF treatment, they may be a risk factor for /uniFB01 stula deterioration, hindering further endoscopic treatment and ideal therapeutic effect [34 -36]. Therefore, for malignant AEF, an airway stent may be a better choice. Furthermore, in our study, the number of cases using esophageal stent implantation was relatively small, which may be due to the regional differences in clinical practice affecting treatment choices [37 -40]. To explore the longterm ef /uniFB01 cacy and safety of esophageal stents, subsequent studies with larger sample sizes are warranted.\nFurthermore, a multifaceted treatment paradigm integrating stent placement alongside additional therapeutic measures, including chemotherapy or immunotherapy, may yield further improvements in patient outcomes. This study serves as a cornerstone for future investigations into optimal management strategies for AEF in patients with esophageal cancer, with the overarching goal of augmenting survival rates and quality of life.",
