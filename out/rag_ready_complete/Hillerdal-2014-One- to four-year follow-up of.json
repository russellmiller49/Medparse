      "content": "Background: Lung volume reduction surgery can improve lung  function  and  working  capacity  in  severe  heterogeneous emphysema. Endobronchial lung volume reduction (ELVR) performed by one-way valves inserted via a flexible bronchoscope can result in a moderate but significant improvement in lung function and exercise tolerance, eliminating the surgical risks. Objectives: Most studies of this method  have  excluded  patients  with  α 1 -antitrypsin  (AAT)  deficiency,  but  small  series  of  cases  with  positive  short-term outcome have been reported. The sustainability of results has been questioned and we here present our experience in AAT-deficient patients treated with ELVR followed up for up to 4 years. Methods: From August 2008 to January 2012, 15 patients were treated with ELVR. Inclusion criteria were homozygotic AAT deficiency, age <80 years, residual volume of 140% or more, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 ) 15-45% of predicted, severe heterogeneous emphysema, symptoms\nis no medical treatment. Bronchodilation can be of value if there is a reversible component of the obstruction, and treatment of intercurrent infections is important. Corticosteroids,  whether  inhaled  or  oral,  are  controversial. Long-term oxygen treatment can improve and prolong the life of patients with low oxygen tension in the blood at rest, and rehabilitation can increase the working capacity and improve the quality of life   [1]  , but the lung function is not affected.\nThe main cause of emphysema is long-term exposure to airborne irritants, especially tobacco smoke. A specific cause  is  severe  α 1 -antitrypsin  (AAT)  deficiency,  which predisposes to the early development of emphysema particularly in smokers. It is an inherited disorder, and its severe form is most often related to the ZZ genotype. The prevalence of severe AAT deficiency ranges from approximately 1/2,000 to 1/5,000 based on population screenings   [2]  .\nSurgical  methods  for  treating  emphysema  include lung transplantation and volume reduction surgery. Lung transplantation is costly and carries a substantial surgical risk. Single lung transplantation is most often performed, with an 80-90% 1-year survival and 50-70% surviving 5 years   [3]  , which is not very different from survival with conservative  management    [4]  but  with  a  much  better quality of health. Survival after transplantation is, however, improving and has now reached 11 years in Swedish patients with AAT deficiency   [5]  . The availability of lung transplants  is  limited,  and  transplantation  is  therefore used only in carefully selected patients.\nLung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) was first described  in  1957  by  Brantigan  and  Mueller    [6]  .  They claimed that a reduction in the lung volume could improve lung elasticity, and in their series the results were good and long lasting, but the perioperative mortality was high with the surgical and anesthetic methods then available. In the mid-1990s, the method was reintroduced with improved techniques   [7]  .  Randomized  studies,  such  as the large NETT (National Emphysema Treatment Trial) in the United States including 1,218 patients   [8] as well as a Swedish study   [9]  , clearly demonstrated that the operation can significantly improve lung function and working capacity, and even reduce mortality in a subset of patients [10]  .\nStill, the perioperative morbidity and mortality rates of LVRS  remain  considerable,  and  less  invasive  methods have therefore been sought. Closure of bronchi with lung sealant    [11]  or  with  thermal  vapor    [12]  have  been  described, but the most investigated method so far is endobronchial  lung  volume  reduction  (ELVR).  One-way\nvalves are inserted via a flexible bronchoscope into segmental bronchi with the aim of achieving atelectasis of the targeted lobe. Randomized studies have shown a moderate but significant improvement in lung function and exercise tolerance, and a low risk of device- and/or procedure-related  complications    [13-16]  .  Improved  survival has been seen in patients where atelectasis of the targeted lobe occurred   [14]  . The method has also been used in the treatment  of  bronchopleural  fistulas  with  good  results [17]  .\nMost ELVR and LVRS studies have excluded patients with AAT deficiency. A small uncontrolled study on such patients followed for 2-12 months after ELVR reported improvement in clinical variables   [18]  . At our clinic, we have treated AAT deficiency patients using this technique for several years, and results have been favorable in the great majority. We here report the results of the feasibility, efficacy and safety of ELVR in carefully selected patients with AAT deficiency and severe heterogeneous emphysema.",

The target lobe should be clearly hyperinflated and nontargeted lobe(s) must be of a better quality based on CT scan and/or lung scintigram evaluation. In addition, interlobar fissures should be clearly visible and non-interrupted in the CT scan. All patients had received optimal medical treatment (including smoking cessation, vaccinations, long-term oxygen therapy when indicated and bronchodilating therapy) and had undergone physical rehabilitation.

      "content": "Patient 1. One woman was referred at the age of 59 years because of severe emphysema, which restricted her daily life considerably. She could only walk short distances very slowly and had practically no social life. She had smoked 10 cigarettes a day in her youth but had stopped more than 20 years earlier. Radiologically, she had bilateral lower lobe emphysema with the right lower lobe severely  hyperinflated  and  the  middle  lobe  atelectatic (  fig. 2  ). FEV 1 was 0.7 liters (24% of predicted), RV 6.3 liters (309%) and TLC 8.4 liters (141%). The diffusing capacity was 26% of predicted. A lung scintigram revealed that only 30% of the lung function was on the right side, and practically all in the upper part. Three valves were\ninserted in the right lower lobe, and already the next day the  patient  was  considerably  less  dyspneic.  Radiology showed a remarkable improvement. At 6 months, FEV  1 was 1.7 liters (64%), RV 3.9 liters (130%) and TLC 7.7 liters (130%), and the diffusing capacity was now 46% of predicted. She could now live an almost normal life and had  resumed  her  social  life.  After  4  years,  her  FEV 1 amounted to 1.6 liters (58%).\nPatient 8. This 71-year-old lady had never smoked. She could only walk up to 100 m very slowly. Radiologically, she had the typical bilateral lower lobe emphysema but most impressive was her hyperinflated middle lobe\n(  fig. 3  a). Her lung function showed an FEV 1 of 0.69 liters (29%), RV 3.1 liters (140%) and TLC 5.9 liters (110%). The middle lobe was closed off with 1 valve which caused an atelectasis (  fig. 3  b). At 6 months, her FEV 1 was 0.8 liters  (35%),  RV  2.5  liters  (115%)  and  TLC  5.6  liters (104%).  Clinically,  she  improved  much.  She  can  now walk at almost normal speed much longer and make her own bed and wash her hair, which had earlier been impossible  for  her.  At  1  year,  her  FEV 1 had  actually  increased further to 1.1 liters (48%) and it remained the same at 2 years.\na\nb",

      "title": "Discussion",
      "content": "AAT deficiency is a hereditary disorder that causes low levels of the enzyme AAT in the blood. AAT is formed in the liver, and the most common genetic defect causes precursors of the enzyme to be deposited there, sometimes causing liver problems such as cirrhosis, which might in turn  be  a  precursor  of  cancer,  which  was  the  cause  of death in one of our patients. The most important consequence  is,  however,  a  high  risk  of  severe  emphysema, which usually develops fairly early in life, especially if the patient has been a smoker. The emphysema is often heterogeneous and typically affects the lower lobes first. In the early LVRS studies, there were some reports that AAT deficiency patients were not suitable for the procedure, possibly because the surgical approach gave best results with upper lobe disease. Since the criteria for ELVR and other  nonsurgical  methods  were  taken  directly  from LVRS studies, such patients were initially excluded from these studies as well. We could see no reason to exclude these patients from ELVR treatment and therefore have included them in our series.\nTwo  factors  are  of  importance  for  the  outcome  of ELVR: the degree of emphysema heterogeneity and the presence of collateral ventilation, 'air leakage', between lobes   [21]  . The goal is to achieve complete lobar atelectasis, which requires completeness of fissures with absence of  collateral  ventilation.  Partial  atelectasis  is  common, which may be sufficient to cause considerable functional improvement   [13]  . A system to measure the degree of collateral  ventilation  has  been  developed  and  can  prevent valve  insertion  in  patients  whom  it  would  not  benefit\n[22]  . We did not have access to this method, but evaluated the fissures  radiologically.  The  literature  confirms that this can be adequate in many instances   [23]  . The improvement in lung function in the present study seems to indicate  that  in  AAT-deficient  patients  the  fissures  are generally much better preserved than in 'ordinary' emphysema patients.\nCompared to baseline, patients showed a mean absolute increase in FEV 1 of approximately 400 ml over 1 year (n = 12) and 450 ml over 2 years (n = 6). Calculated as percent of predicted values, FEV 1  increased from 26 to 42% over 1 year (n = 12, p < 0.05) and from 24 to 42% over 2 years (n = 6, p < 0.05). In a previous study on ELVR in emphysema patients, the mean absolute FEV  1 increase was 34.5 ml at 6 months and the mean predicted value increased from 30 to 31%   [13]  . However, in this study, fissures were not studied and thus a considerable number of patients probably did have collateral ventilation, thus considerably weakening the mean effect of the procedure. In a previous study on AAT deficiency patients (n = 6), ELVR resulted in a mean FEV  1 increase of 265 ml measured from baseline to the last available data 2-12 months later   [18]  . After LVRS, a mean FEV 1 increase of 140 ml 1 year after surgery has been reported   [9]  . Thus, our results on patients with AAT deficiency compare favorably with those of several other studies in which baseline values for FEV  1 were within similar ranges. In different studies, the yearly rate of decrease in FEV 1 in patients with AAT deficiency has been estimated to be 36-38 ml in never and ex-smokers, increasing to 61-316 ml in current smokers [2]  . This effect of the disease should be taken into account when assessing the treatment results in the present study.\nAnother important finding, as seen from   figure 1  , is that the improvement in lung function was stable and in most cases seemed to deteriorate only very slowly, giving the responding patients years of a fairly good life. The 3 patients followed for 4 years did not deteriorate significantly  over  the  entire  observation  period.  Good  longterm results in patients treated with ELVR have been reporter earlier   [24]  , but to our knowledge not in patients with AAT deficiency. The natural course of this disease is a slow but steady deterioration of lung function, which often will finally necessitate lung transplantation. In our opinion, this outcome could be postponed with ELVR in suitable patients for a number of years. Intravenous augmentation therapy has been shown to affect the lung density change over the years favorably   [25]  , and possibly this could further delay transplantation after ELVR. Some patients might also be eligible for ELVR of the other side after some years.\nAfter unilateral lung transplantation, the emphysematous process might continue in the native lung, which in extreme cases can become so hyperinflated that it compresses  the  transplanted  lung  ('native  lung  hyperinflation'), and LVRS of the native lung can then become nec-\nessary   [26]  . Two of our patients had this problem, and 1 patient improved after ELVR, but the other one did not. As seen from the results in our patients and in accordance with  the  literature    [27]  ,  in  this  situation,  ELVR  might avoid the risks with LVRS but give similar results. However, if the native lung is extensively destroyed, valves in one lobe might result in an even larger hyperinflation of the remaining lobe(s) and then the patient will not benefit.\nWe conclude that ELVR in carefully selected AAT deficiency  patients  with  severe  emphysema  can  be  safely performed  with  encouraging  long-lasting  results.  The procedure can easily be reversed if necessary. We therefore believe that ELVR can constitute a bridge to transplantation, i.e. postpone this procedure, presumably for several years.",
