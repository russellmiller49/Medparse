An additional 45 patients without clinical  or  echocardiographic  evidence  of  PH  were  included as controls (group B). Baseline demographics were similar between the groups. The median age was 63 8 14 versus 58 8 16 years, respectively (p = 0.12). The majority of patients were of Caucasian descent (82%) and male gender (55%). Causes of PH varied: idiopathic pulmonary arterial  hypertension  (n  =  15),  interstitial  lung  disease (n = 14), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 11), left heart disease (n = 4) and sarcoidosis (n = 1).\nHemodynamics  and  baseline  characteristics  of  patients with PH are depicted in   table 1  .

      "title": "Discussion",
      "content": "The main findings of this study are that FB can be performed safely in patients with PH, and that bronchoscopic diagnostic procedures, including transbronchial biopsies, are not associated with an increased risk of hemorrhage. Importantly, patients with PH do not have a high risk of cardio-respiratory complications such as hypoxemia, hypotension or cardiac arrhythmias as a result of FB.\nBronchoscopy is considered a safe procedure associated  with  a  very  low  complication  rate  and  negligible mortality   [2]  .  Several  studies  and  survey  analyses  have estimated the rate of major complications among experienced pulmonary physicians to be ! 2%   [12, 13]  . Moreover, reports have suggested that FB can be performed safely  in  patients  considered  at  risk  for  complications, such as patients with chronic obstructive lung disease, asthma and thrombocytopenia, as well as after myocardial infarction   [14]  .\nSeveral features present in patients with PH are thought to increase the risk of complications with FB. For example, chronic venous PH may cause dilation of submucosal bronchial veins and their plexuses   [15]  . The presence of elevated pulmonary capillary pressure has been related with significant hemorrhage after transbronchial biopsies   [5, 16, 17]  . Additionally, patients with severe PH often have right ventricular dysfunction and may be at risk for cardiac ischemia, arrhythmias and hypotension   [12, 1820]  . Finally, FB can also be associated with transient hypoxemia   [21] which may be a particular concern in patients with PH who may be hypoxic at baseline and frequently have poor cardio-respiratory reserve   [22]  .\nIn our study, the majority of the patients (60%) had evidence of moderate to severe PH (RVSP 1 50 mm Hg),\nData  are  mean 8 SD.  SpO2  =  Pulse  oximetry  saturation; FiO2 = inspired fraction of oxygen; Relative risk (RR) = respiratory rate; Hazard ratio (HR) = heart rate; BP = blood pressure.\nNYHA = New York Heart Association; CHF = congestive heart failure.\nand more than a third had a poor functional class (New York Heart Association class III-IV). Despite evidence of PH severity, no major complications occurred: there were no incidents of moderate or severe hemorrhage, none of the patients developed refractory hypotension or hemodynamic instability, there were no fatalities, and none required hospitalization or developed respiratory failure.\nThe rate of minor complications in patients with PH was higher than in the control group; nevertheless, this difference  did  not  reach  statistical  significance.  Use  of sedatives may have contributed to the development of minor  complications  such  as  hypoxemia  or  hypotension. One study showed an 8% incidence of transient hypoxia associated with the use of midazolam   [23]  . Similarly, and despite the use of higher doses of sedatives, we found a low incidence of transient hypoxemia (9%) in patients with PH.  Although  the  rate  of  minor  complications  is  high compared with prior survey analyses and retrospective reviews   [3, 4, 24, 25]  , the discrepancy between our results and prior findings may be a consequence of differences of the  definition  of  complications  and  ascertainment  bias across studies rather than an effect associated with PH.\nSignificant bleeding after FB is infrequent and occurs more commonly after transbronchial biopsies. It has been suggested that PH is associated with an increased risk of hemorrhage and should be considered a contraindication for TBLB   [26]  . Evidence to support the concept of elevated pressure at the capillary level increasing the risk of bleeding in patients with PH is limited. Despite the lack of available studies, a survey reported that up to 40% of pulmonary physicians considered PAPs of 6 40 mm Hg unsafe for TBLB   [24]  .\nSchulman et al.   [27] prospectively studied the occurrence of bleeding in heart transplant recipients that underwent TBLB for the evaluation of parenchymal lung disease. The incidence of moderate hemorrhage (25-100 ml) was 15% when mPAP was 1 16 mm Hg. Other reports have found lower rates of hemorrhage. In an animal model of induced PH, an increase in PAPs (12-33 mm Hg) did not increase the risk of bleeding   [28]  . Morris et al.   [29] investigated the risk for hemorrhage in 21 patients with interstitial lung disease and echocardiographic evidence of PH who underwent TBLB and found evidence of bleeding in only 1 patient.\nWe report a low rate of bleeding complications occurring after TBLB (8.3%) in patients with PH. A relevant observation is that TBLB was performed less frequently in patients with PH compared with controls (24 vs. 32). Unfortunately, we could not find enough documentation to explain for the difference between the groups; there-\nfore, we cannot exclude the possibility of operator bias. Additionally, although analysis of the rate of complications related to TBLB alone did not reach statistical significance, small numbers preclude further conclusions in patients with severe PH.\nFB can also be associated with cardiovascular complications such as hypotension, dysrhythmias and cardiac arrest   [20, 30, 31]  . A study of FB performed under topical anesthesia found significant increases in mean arterial pressure and heart rate and an 86% increase in pulmonary capillary  wedge  pressure;  these  hemodynamic changes were similar during passage through the larynx and during suctioning   [9]  . Hemodynamic complications after FB appear to be rare. A recent study that included more than 20,000 procedures reported an incidence of cardiac arrhythmias of 1%, including 3 deaths from cardiopulmonary arrest (0.013%)   [13]  . In our study, invasive hemodynamic monitoring was not performed; however, there were no episodes of arrhythmia or electrocardiographic evidence of cardiac ischemia. Similarly, despite more frequent use of oxygen at baseline, patients with PH did  not  develop  more  hypoxemia  compared  with  controls, and none of the patients developed respiratory failure associated with the procedure.\nThe study has several limitations. First, data were collected retrospectively and are subject to charting errors and/or paucity of event recordings. Second, not all of the patients with echocardiographic evidence of PH underwent RHC; therefore, underestimation or overestimation of PAPs is possible. Third, definition of bleeding was subjective, and although all patients had appropriate documentation of hemorrhagic complications, we could not find  information  regarding  the  amount  of  blood  suctioned during the procedure. Finally, we included only 6 patients with clinically severe PH who underwent TBLB; thus, the risk of hemorrhagic complications from TBLB in this group may be underestimated.\nIn conclusion, our study suggests that FB can be performed safely in patients with mild to moderate PH. Patients with PH were able to tolerate sedation and suctioning  without  hemodynamic  consequences.  The  risk  of hemorrhage does not appear to be elevated when transbronchial biopsies or transbronchial needle aspirations are performed; nevertheless, caution must be used in patients with severe PH as data are limited in this subgroup of patients. Finally, despite higher use of oxygen at baseline, patients with PH did not have an increased risk for respiratory failure or refractory hypoxemia after FB. Prospective  studies  with  hemodynamic  measurements  are needed to confirm these preliminary findings.",
