Akulian, MD, MPH, Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 (e-mail: jason_akulian@med.unc.edu).\nPercutaneous dilational tracheostomy (PDT) and endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement are well studied procedures which have been adopted by some interventional pulmonologists (IPs) in the treatment of critically ill patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. The /uniFB01 eld of interventional pulmonology has placed itself in a unique position to adopt these procedures due to its knowledge of tracheal anatomy, rigid bronchoscopic airway management, and advanced endoscopy gained during subspecialty fellowship training. 1,2 Approximately 10% of the patients requiring mechanical ventilation will undergo tracheostomy, 3 -5 with slightly more than half also having PEG placement for longterm nutrition. 6 Recent publications have illustrated that PDT and PEG are safely and effectively performed by IPs and that development of a multidisciplinary team of providers can not only improve identi /uniFB01 cation of patients in need of intervention but result in a cost bene /uniFB01 t to the institution.",

Their method involved a /uniFB01 xation needle, /uniFB01 nder needle, and cutting trocar which introduced the tracheostomy tube. 7 Reports of injuries to the trachea and aorta related to the new technique suggested that the force required to place the tracheostomy via this method may have led to adverse outcomes. 8,9 Toy et al presented a similar device in 1969 which combined dilation and cutting into one instrument with the addition of a guide wire; however, the technique was never widely adopted. 10 The modern PDT era began when Ciaglia et al published their experience using serial tracheal dilations over a wire in 1985. 11",

      "content": "Since its introduction, many studies, including meta-analyses have been published which have repeatedly demonstrated the superiority of PDT over surgical tracheostomy in suitable patients. 12 -15 The two most recent and statistically robust meta-analyses included over 1,000 patients, with both showing a signi /uniFB01 cant reduction in the risk of wound infection and length of procedure time associated with PDT. In addition, no difference in bleeding risk or mortality was noted when comparing modalities. 13,14 One of the two meta-analyses found an increased risk of decannulation and obstruction associated with PDT. The authors noted however, that complication severity was not recorded or reported. 14\nCost has been shown to be one of the most strongly differentiating factors between PDT and surgical tracheostomy. In a single center prospective evaluation of cost-effectiveness using charge generation as a surrogate for cost, Freeman et al, showed signi /uniFB01 cantly decreased costs associated with PDT. 16 In a large meta-analysis, Higgins et al, also found decreased cost associated with PDT. 14 Several authors have suggested that a substantial portion of the cost savings associated with PDT results from the avoidance of the operating room and its associated costs. 16,17",

      "content": "Ciaglia et al /uniFB01 rst reported their percutaneous technique in 1985 using a modi /uniFB01 ed percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement setup. The originally proposed insertion site for the tracheostomy tube was the space separating the cricoid cartilage and /uniFB01 rst tracheal ring or the /uniFB01 rst intertracheal ring space. The site was identi /uniFB01 ed by palpation and an incision made. After blunt dissection the endotracheal tube (ETT) was withdrawn to a point immediately distal to the vocal cords. A needlewas then used to puncture the trachea and the ETTwas manipulated. If the needle moved with ETT movement the process was repeated after further retraction of the ETT tube until there was no movement of the needle with ETT manipulation and air /uniFB02 owed freely through the needle. A cannula was then inserted followed by a guide wire and dilation with several additional dilators. Finally, the tracheostomy tube was introduced over a dilator and secured in place. 11\nThe original technique has been further re /uniFB01 ned since its original report with regard to the dilation method and site placement. Two commercially available kits -the Ciaglia Blue Rhino (BRPDT, Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN) and Ciaglia Blue Dolphin (Cook Medical) ( ► Fig. 1 ) -have replaced serial dilation with a single hydrophilic dilator or an expandable balloon for dilation, respectively. Two small single-center, randomized trials comparing the Blue Rhino single dilation kit to a traditional multiple dilation kits found that the single dilation technique with the Ciaglia Blue Rhino resulted in shorter procedure time and was not associated with an increase in the complication rate. 19,20 A large multicenter study of 500 consecutive patients with a before and after design found a decrease in the complication rates after switching the multiple dilator to single insertion technique (13.6 -6.5%). 21\nIn a recent, small, single-center, randomized comparison of the BRPDT and Blue Dolphin, Cianchi et al, found a longer\nB\nprocedure time, increased incidence of dif /uniFB01 culty passing the tracheostomy tube, and an increased risk of minor bleeding associated with the use of the Blue Dolphin kit. 22",

The initial portion of the procedure is identical to the Ciaglia method in terms of patient preparation, position, initial incision, /uniFB01 nder cannula placement, and guide wire placement. After removing the Seldinger needle and after passage of the guide wire into the trachea the Griggs forceps are passed over the wire and used to dilate the pretracheal soft tissues and then the tracheal tissues to the appropriate diameter. A tracheostomy tube is then inserted over the wire loaded on an appropriately sized dilator. Two single-center prospective trials comparing the original serial Ciaglia dilation technique to the Griggs technique both found that the serial dilation technique took longer than the Griggs ' technique. 23,24 The small, nonrandomized trial did not /uniFB01 nd any statistically signi /uniFB01 cant differences in complication rates between the two methods. 23,25 The larger, randomized trial found an increase in minor and major complications (including pneumothorax, posterior tracheal injury, loss of a stable airway, and conversion to a different procedure) using the progressive dilation method. 24 Several randomized, longitudinal trials comparing the single dilation Ciaglia technique and the Griggs technique have also been conducted. 26 -30 A meta-analysis of these trials found evidence of superiority of the Ciaglia technique using a combined endpoint representing procedural dif /uniFB01 culties and bleeding. 31",

      "content": "In 1997, Fantoni et al, introduced a new method of PDTwhich represented a radical departure from the conventional methodologies to date. The impetus to develop a new technique was their desire to reduce the risk of injury to the tracheal wall and to reduce the incidence of the creation of false passages. Their method involves the introduction of a rigid tracheoscope through the vocal cords, the application of slight pressure to tent the trachea and direct visualization of the needle puncture directed cranially into the tracheoscope. A guide wire is then passed through the needle, tracheoscope, vocal cords, and out of the mouth. The needle and tracheoscope are then removed and a specialized ventilation catheter is placed into the distal trachea and its balloon in /uniFB02 ated; ventilation is then possible while the remainder of the procedure is completed. A specialized dilation device attached to a cannula is then secured to the wire and pulled through the mouth toward the neck to dilate the stoma with the assistance of small skin incisions. Once the cannula is properly positioned the tracheostomy is secured in place. 33 In 2009, Divisi et al, reported the results of a retrospective comparison of Fantoni tracheostomy to BRPDT. They showed both techniques could be performed easily and safely, but that BRPDTwas associated with fewer complications and a significant cost bene /uniFB01 t. 34",

After gaining access and threading a guide wire into the trachea, a self-tapping screw is used to create the anterior tracheotomy. The procedure is conducted under direct visualization and then terminated once the widest part of the dilation tool is clearly seen. 35 The dilation tool is then removed and the tracheostomy tube is inserted. A trial comparing this method to the BRPDT reported more total complications and signi /uniFB01 cantly more failed tracheostomy cannula insertions requiring a changeof method associated with the use of the PercuTwist. 36",

      "content": "The role of bronchoscopy during PDT has evolved considerably since its introduction. Many of the initial PDT reports did not utilize direct bronchoscopic visualization; however, cadaveric evidence has suggested that blindly inserted tracheostomy /uniFB01 nder needles are frequently misplaced. 37 Few comparisons of PDT with and without bronchoscopy are available. In one small retrospective study, Jackson et al; did not detect a signi /uniFB01 cant difference in early or late complication rates when comparing PDT with and without bronchoscopy. 38 An earlier study from 2009 found that the use of video bronchoscopy was associated with a slight reduction in procedure time and a reduction in the complication rates. 39 A multicenter prospective study of conventional directly visualized bronchoscopy versus video bronchoscopy found an increased subjective feeling of operator safety using video\nbronchoscopy and a reduction in complication rates. 40 In an informal aggregate comparison of 15 studies involving 1,385 patients, Hsia et al, reported a reduction in PDT procedural complication rates when using bronchoscopy (16.8 vs. 8.7%). 41\nDespite the relative paucity of comparative data, survey data show that more than 70% of the European intensive care units perform PDT with video-bronchoscopic guidance. 42 -45 Data quantifying the frequency with which bronchoscopic guidance is used in the United States is lacking. Though the evidence does not strongly support the use of bronchoscopy during PDT, data exist that its use potentially reduces complication rates with no real associated increase in risk.",
