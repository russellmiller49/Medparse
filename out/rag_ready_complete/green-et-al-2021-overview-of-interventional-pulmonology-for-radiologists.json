The range of procedures includes diagnostic and therapeutic options for both benign and malignant diseases. Imaging plays a key role in identifying patients who will benefit from interventional pulmonology procedures, detailing the relevant anatomy and measurements for procedure planning, and monitoring patients for successful outcomes and complications (Table 1).

Because of the size and stiffness of the bronchoscope, rigid bronchoscopy requires general anesthesia and maintains airway patency in patients with respiratory failure.\nAlthough it fell out of favor after development of the flexible bronchoscope, rigid bronchoscopy is now an essential tool in the interventional pulmonology arsenal. In addition to foreign body removal, it helps diagnose and treat both benign and malignant diseases of the trachea and main bronchi, usually in combination with other tools passed through its lumen. It also has a beveled distal end for tumor débridement and quick airway recanalization.",

      "content": "The first flexible bronchoscope was developed in the 1960s by a team led by Japanese thoracic surgeon Shigeto Ikeda (5). With improved maneuverability allowing access to subsegmental airways, bronchoscopists could visualize and sample material from the lower respiratory tract for diagnosis of infectious, inflammatory, and malignant diseases. Many new innovations followed, including bronchial brushing, bronchoalveolar lavage, and transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA).\nThe main components of a flexible bronchoscope are the (a) suction port; (b) working channel port, through which various tools are passed; and (c) flexible insertion cord, which contains the working channel and an optical device for light and image transmission (Fig 1). The distal tip of most flexible bronchoscopes provides a 120° field of view and bends for wider visualization.\nNowadays, most flexible bronchoscopy examinations are performed for diagnostic purposes. The treatment of central airway obstruction (CAO) with a flexible bronchoscope alone is not recommended, although it can be passed through the lumen of a rigid bronchoscope to more distal lesions. Flexible bronchoscopy is generally safe, with a low rate of complications such as pneumothorax, bleeding, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, and transient hoarseness.",

      "content": "Modifications for improving endobronchial access to peripheral lung lesions include radial-probe\nConvex-probe Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) provides a 90° view parallel to the transducer, is equipped with Doppler US, and guides real-time tissue sampling (Fig 2). Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided TBNA is more accurate than CT or PET in staging the mediastinum in patients with lung cancer, with a pooled sensitivity of 89% and specificity approaching 100% (6,7).\nRadial-probe Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) integrates a US transducer into a free-standing probe that can be advanced through the working channel of a flexible bronchoscope. Radial-probe Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) provides anatomic detail of the tracheal wall with better sensitivity than CT in distinguishing tumor invasion from extrinsic compression (8). However, its most common use is in evaluating pulmonary\nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), ultrathin bronchoscopy, and electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy (ENB). An ultrathin bronchoscope is a flexible bronchoscope with a 3-mm outer diameter that is capable of reaching one generation of bronchi farther than a standard thin bronchoscope. A recent single-center study achieved a diagnostic yield of 70.1% by using an ultrathin bronchoscope, compared with 58.7% with a thin bronchoscope (9).\nENB extends peripheral reach with guidance from preprocedure thin-section CT, which is segmented into virtual bronchoscopic images with proprietary software. Table 2 shows the required CT acquisition parameters, and a key feature is the degree of section overlap. During ENB, the patient lies on an electromagnetic mat that links to a sensor on a steerable navigation catheter or locatable guide. The survey bronchoscopy is then\nregistered to the virtual bronchoscopy, generating an airway road map to the specified target. The locatable guide and an extended working channel are passed through the flexible bronchoscope, providing real-time feedback throughout the procedure. Fluoroscopy assists most cases and allows the bronchoscopist to make subtle adjustments (10). Radial-probe Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) may be used to help confirm proximity to the target lesion but must be removed before TBNA.\nThe overall diagnostic yield of ENB is 65%73% (10-12). The sensitivity for detecting cancer is 69%-71%, but the negative predictive value is only 52%-56% (10,11). The presence of the CT bronchus sign-an airway directly leading to a lesion and becoming occluded or continuing through the lesion as an air bronchogram-helps improve diagnostic success rates. In a prospective study of 51 patients, ENB was diagnostic in 79% of cases with a CT bronchus sign but in only 31% otherwise (13). Greater nodule size and visualization with radial-probe Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) are also associated with increased diagnostic yield (9,12).\nConventional ENB lacks real-time guidance to account for lesion divergence due to changing lung volume. Digital fluoroscopic tomosynthesis and cone-beam CT have shown promise in depicting lesions that are not visible with conventional fluoroscopy. The acquired real-time dataset, referred to as augmented fluoroscopy, modifies the virtual target on the basis of updated registration with the planning CT (Fig 3). A recent retrospective study showed a diagnostic yield of 79% for ENB with digital tomosynthesis compared with 54% with ENB alone (14). Studies of cone-beam CT showed a diagnostic yield of 70%-84% when assisting ENB (15-17). Additional comparative studies are needed to corroborate these data and further evaluate radiation exposure.\nPotential radiographic findings after ENB include pneumothorax and transient increased opacity surrounding the target lesion due to hemor-\nrhage or retained lavage fluid (if performed).  The pneumothorax rate for ENB is 3%-6% with chest tube placement in 1.6%-2.9% of cases (10-12). Percutaneous CT -guided biopsy requires chest tube placement for pneumothorax in approximately 6.6% of cases but has a better diagnostic yield (18). The postbiopsy bleeding rate is similar for the two techniques at about 1% of patients (12,18).",

      "title": "Therapeutic Bronchoscopy",
      "content": "CAO is defined as greater than 50% cross-sectional narrowing of the trachea, main bronchi, bronchus intermedius, or lobar bronchi. Clinical signs include dyspnea, hemoptysis, wheezing, postobstructive pneumonia, and respiratory failure. Malignant CAO is separated into intrinsic masses (primary tumors and endoluminal metastases), extrinsic compression (lymphadenopathy or tumors such as primary lung, esophageal, and thyroid cancer), and mixed lesions (generally originating in the mediastinum and invading the airway). Causes of benign CAO include benign tumors, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, radiation therapy, lung transplant, tuberculosis and other infections, sarcoidosis, and prior intubation.\nTreatment of malignant CAO is typically palliative because of its advanced stage, and surgery is usually not indicated. While chemotherapy and radiation therapy can take weeks to relieve an obstruction, therapeutic bronchoscopy provides immediate relief in 93% of patients, although only about 48% experience clinical improvement (19). Endobronchial therapies for malignant CAO are summarized in Table 3. An overall adverse event rate of 2.2% varies across institutions, and complications are more frequent than in benign CAO (20,21). A delay in treatment decreases the likelihood of a successful outcome, highlighting the importance of recognizing CAO at CT.\nImportant features of CAO to identify are the degree and type of stenosis (intrinsic, extrinsic, or mixed), location and length, proximity to\nbranch points, airway diameter proximal and distal to the stenosis, and patency of the airway distal to the stenosis, which is a predictor for better outcome (22). Assessment of airway invasion with extrinsic lesions is not reliable at CT when limited to the wall. Projection into the lumen, mucosal thickening, and interruption of calcified cartilage are more definitive signs of invasion.\nFor CAO due to tracheobronchomalacia, dynamic expiratory CT should be performed because it induces a greater degree of luminal narrowing than end-expiratory imaging and is more sensitive for diagnosis (23). Some institutions use a 70% reduction of anterior-posterior diameter rather than 50% to improve specificity. For other causes of CAO, there is no standardized measurement method for cross-sectional luminal narrowing. Although CT acquisition at full inhalation is ideal, breath holding in many patients with CAO is limited. An estimate of the degree of luminal narrowing is usually sufficient, as the decision to intervene is not based on a single measurement but on several factors such as suspected cause (benign or malignant), type of stenosis, lesion extent, patient condi-\ntion, bronchoscopic appearance, and anticipated response to therapy. The main imaging finding after successful treatment of CAO is improved airway patency. Rarely, perforation results in pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, hematoma, or fluid collection.",

The most common complication is bleeding, although it is usually minor and easily controlled (24). Forceps and the beveled tip of a rigid bronchoscope are the main débridement tools. Rigid bronchoscopic debulking is ideal for larger pieces of tissue, while forceps are favored for more precise tissue removal.

The ideal lesion for ablation is intraluminal and focal. Ablation is contraindicated in extrinsic compression to avoid damaging normal mucosa and extensive lesions that cannot be fully visualized to ensure a salvageable distal airway. Prolonged sedation and reduced fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 )(to avoid airway fire during thermal ablation) are the main reasons for severe albeit rare complications such as respiratory failure, arrhythmia, and death (20).\nElectrocautery. -Electrocautery uses an electric current to directly heat and destroy tissue. It is relatively cheap, widely available, and easy to use (25). It débrides tissue on its own or coagulates\nbleeding tissue after mechanical débridement or other ablative modalities. Although most frequently used for tumors, electrocautery can also disrupt benign stenotic webs (Fig 4). The rate of major complications is less than 1% (25).\nLaser Therapy. -Laser therapy uses thermal energy that is produced as light and transferred to tissue (Fig 5). Although many types of biomedical laser technologies are available, the most commonly used is the neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser. In addition to its immediate effect, thermal injury has a delayed effect for several days after application, further improving luminal patency. Laser therapy offers deeper tissue penetration than other ablative techniques, although high cost,",

      "content": "bulky size of the apparatus, and the need for protective eyewear limit its use.\nArgon Plasma Coagulation. -APC is a noncontact electrocoagulation technique that heats adjacent tissue through a high-frequency current meeting argon gas at the probe tip. Because of its limited depth of effect, APC is usually a complementary technique for achieving hemostasis after débridement. Although it is generally considered safe and effective, gas embolism is an extremely rare but life-threatening complication (26). APC application in the trachea is associated with gas embolization to the right atrium through systemic veins, whereas APC in the bronchi results in gas embolization to the left atrium through pulmonary veins (27).\nCryotherapy. -Cryotherapy destroys tissue by controlled application of extreme cold energy directly onto target tissue, followed by multiple freeze-thaw cycles with temperatures as low as -90°C. Unlike thermal ablation techniques, the use of cryotherapy preserves tissue architecture for biopsy, does not require decreased FiO 2 , and can remove foreign bodies with high water content. Because tissue necrosis takes days to weeks, cryotherapy is not suitable in patients who require immediate relief. Cryoadhesion is an alternative technique with instantaneous effect. The cryoprobe adheres to tissue and is then abruptly withdrawn along with an attached piece of tissue. Bleeding is the main complication (up to 12% of cases), but it is typically minor and easily coagulated (28).\nPhotodynamic Therapy. -Photodynamic therapy is approved for definitive treatment of central early-stage lung cancer and malignant CAO palliation. A photosensitizing drug is injected before photodynamic therapy and preferentially delivered to malignant cells with high metabolic activity. An endobronchial photodynamic therapy probe then emits a specific frequency at the target lesion, ac-\ntivating the photosensitizer and initiating necrosis. After several days, repeat bronchoscopy débrides nonviable tumor.\nEndobronchial Brachytherapy. -Endobronchial brachytherapy (EBB) delivers palliative radiation in patients with symptomatic endoluminal or compressive tumors. A narrow-bore brachytherapy catheter is placed bronchoscopically and securely taped at the nostril. The catheter is then removed after EBB, and tissue necrosis ensues over the next several weeks.\nEBB offers higher doses of localized radiation than external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), improving local control while sparing normal tissue. EBB can also be used in combination with EBRT, stent placement, or other ablative therapies. One randomized trial showed improved re-expansion of collapsed lung with EBB and EBRT compared with EBRT alone (29). However, a meta-analysis showed no conclusive evidence of symptom improvement or survival advantage with the addition of EBB and instead recommended EBB for symptomatic patients who are not candidates for further chemotherapy or EBRT (30). The main complication is fatal hemoptysis, with rates ranging from 7% to 22% in randomized trials (31).\nPatient selection, optimal catheter positioning, and treatment planning are determined with CT features of CAO. For patients undergoing chest radiography before radiation therapy, the brachytherapy catheter has a small radiopaque marker at the tip and should not be mistaken for a misplaced enteric tube (Fig 6). A successful response to EBB results in improved airway patency and reaeration of previously collapsed lobes.",

      "content": "Airway stents are endoluminal prostheses designed to maintain or restore airway patency in symptomatic patients. Stents treat both benign and malignant disease, and most experts agree they should\nbe reserved for palliative measures when other techniques are unsuccessful or infeasible (32). Indications include extrinsic compression, benign strictures, tracheomalacia, and healing of a fistula or anastomotic dehiscence. The overall complication rate is 3.9% (20).\nSilicone and metallic stents are the main types in current use. Silicone stents, which require rigid bronchoscopy for placement, are the most widely used and favored for benign stenoses. They are customizable, adjustable after deployment, and can be easily removed. The main complication is stent migration in 9.5% of cases (33). Granulation tissue ingrowth at the proximal or distal end and obstruction due to secretions are less frequent complications. Bifurcating silicone stents (Y-stents) are useful for carinal or bilateral main bronchial involvement.\nMetallic stents can be deployed during flexible bronchoscopy, but many bronchoscopists prefer rigid bronchoscopy. The incidence of migration is lower than that of silicone stents, but they are more difficult to adjust and remove (34). Metallic stents are mainly used for malignant CAO but can be used for short-term trials in benign disease or when rigid bronchoscopy is not feasible for silicone stent placement.\nIn addition to the aforementioned imaging features of CAO, the lengths of landing zones proximal and distal to the stenosis are necessary for stent selection and planning. Metallic stents are MRI conditional. At radiography and CT, they have high attenuation with a latticelike structure (Figs 7, 8). Silicone stents cannot be visualized at chest radiography and are less highly attenuating at CT, with a uniform uninterrupted structure (Fig 9).\nDeveloping stent technology includes biodegradable, drug-eluting, and customizable threedimensional (3D)-printed silicone stents, which are patient- and lesion-specific designs derived from a CT dataset. Automated airway segmentation generates a 3D model with digital augmentation of the stenosis, and a 3D-printed stent model is then derived from the corrected airway anatomy (Fig 10).",

While short-term results are generally good with immediate relief of symptoms, some patients require more than one dilation or additional treatment with laser or stent placement (36,37). The likelihood of long-term success depends on factors such as the cause, length, and severity of the stenosis at presentation.\nBalloon bronchoplasty may be combined with other endobronchial treatments but is not suggested as a sole treatment of malignant CAO because of the high likelihood of restenosis (38). Balloon size is based on the diameter of the normal lumen proximal to the stenosis. For main bronchus stenosis near the carina, the contralateral main bronchus diameter is more indicative of balloon size. Balloon bronchoplasty is an overall safe procedure without significant complications (39). Microperforations may result in pneumomediastinum at postprocedure imaging but are usually not clinically significant.",

      "title": "Bronchoscopic Lung Volume Reduction",
      "content": "Approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2018, bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (BLVR) treats emphysema with one-way endobronchial valves placed into a single lobe, preventing air entry while allowing air and mucus\nto exit.  T arget lobe collapse after valve placement results in improved exercise tolerance, oxygen requirements, and overall quality of life (40-44).\nThe National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT) demonstrated improved survival and quality of life after lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) compared with standard medical treatment in participants with predominantly upper lobe emphysema and low baseline exercise capacity (45). However, many patients are not eligible for LVRS because of surgical risk. BLVR is a less invasive alternative that mimics the physiologic changes of LVRS, although outcome data comparing the two are lacking.\nAn endobronchial valve consists of a silicone valve within a nickel-titanium stentlike retainer covered by a silicone membrane. Currently, the two commercially available endobronchial valves supported by randomized control trial data are the Zephyr Valve (Pulmonx) and the Spiration Valve System (Olympus).\nIdeal candidates for BLVR have severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) with reduced forced expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV 1 ) (15%-45% predicted), hyperinflated lungs (total lung capacity >100% predicted), and air trapping (residual volume >150% predicted), despite optimal medical therapy (40). Patients who are not suitable candidates have large bullae greater than one-third of either hemithorax, clinically significant bronchiectasis, incomplete fissures, nickel or silicone allergy, or other prohibitive medical conditions (43).\nPre-BLVR evaluation involves a noncontrast volumetric chest CT at full inhalation, performed with a multidetector scanner with thin-section acquisition (0.6-1.25 mm), overlap, and a low-frequency reconstruction kernel. The measurements derived from quantitative CT analysis are the emphysema score, heterogeneity score, and fissure integrity (Fig 12). While the most emphysematous lobes, degree of hetero-\nFigure 12.

      "content": "used threshold for thin-section scans is -950 HU, although both thresholds are reported. Target lobes have an emphysema score greater than 50% (47). Acute pulmonary findings such as pneumonia and edema falsely decrease the emphysema score, and repeat imaging may be needed.\nThe heterogeneity score refers to the difference in emphysema score between ipsilateral lobes (47). Although early trials showed clinical improvement in only patients with heterogeneous emphysema (heterogeneity score >15), subsequent studies with refined patient selection demonstrated benefit in patients with homogeneous emphysema (heterogeneity score <15) (40,42,48,49).\nIncomplete fissures (fissure integrity <90%) allow collateral ventilation from adjacent lobes and reduce the likelihood of lobar collapse (47). While fissure integrity is calculated by using quantitative CT and ideally is greater than 90%, the fissures should be subjectively assessed for any defects to substantiate quantitative CT findings or resolve any potential discrepancies between different quantitative CT platforms. Coronal and sagittal CT reconstructions help identify fissure defects, which tend to be located\nmedially toward the hila (Fig 13). The left major fissure is complete more frequently than the right fissures (50). In patients with an incomplete minor fissure, the right upper and middle lobes can be targeted simultaneously. Collateral ventilation can also be directly measured bronchoscopically with the Chartis System (Pulmonx), which is a proprietary balloon-tipped catheter that measures flow and pressure in the target lobe. Persistent flow after balloon occlusion confirms collateral ventilation.\nPerfusion scintigraphy or SPECT/CT may help identify an optimal target lobe in patients with homogeneous emphysema or multiple potential targets (Fig 14). Patients with target lobe hypoperfusion or a well-perfused ipsilateral nontarget lobe show greater clinical improvement after BLVR than patients with good target lobe perfusion and poor ipsilateral perfusion (51,52). The major limitation of perfusion imaging is quantification by lung zones (upper, mid, and lower) rather than individual lobes. Software for semiautomatic SPECT/CT lobar quantification is available but not widespread.\nAt chest radiography, endobronchial valves are small umbrellalike structures with radiopaque\nstruts located centrally within a lobe (Fig 15). Three to five valves are typically deployed per procedure. The goal of lobar collapse may take days to weeks. Pneumothorax is the most frequent adverse event after BLVR (up to 26.6% of cases) but does not affect the likelihood of lobar collapse or long-term clinical benefit (40,43,44,48,53) (Fig 15). The mechanism is thought to be rupture of\nsubpleural blebs or bullae in nontreated lobes due to a rapid shift in lung volumes (42). Because most pneumothoraces occur within 3 days, hospitalization is recommended for a minimum of 72 hours after BLVR (40,53).\nCollateral ventilation due to valve migration prevents lobar collapse. Subtle valve migration may not be appreciated at radiography but can be inferred at CT if the target lobe fails to collapse and all segments are not obstructed by a valve (Fig 16). The rate of valve migration or expectoration is 0.6%-7.2% (40,43,48). Other uncommon complications include pneumonia, hemoptysis, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, and respiratory failure. Additional drawbacks of BLVR are the unavoidable collapse of some healthy lung tissue and inability to detect new lung nodules in the collapsed lobe, which remains at high risk for lung cancer.\nBefore BLVR, endobronchial valves were approved in 2008 for humanitarian use in patients with persistent air leak, blocking airflow and allowing the distal lung to heal (Fig 17). In a retrospective study of 40 patients, air leak completely resolved in 48% of patients and decreased in 45% of patients (54). Chest tubes can usually be removed after a few weeks followed by valve removal in 1-2 months (54).",

Radiofrequency energy is delivered to the lobe through subsegmental bronchi over a series of bronchoscopic procedures with the goal of reducing smooth muscle mass and contractility.\nBT reduces corticosteroid usage, severe asthma exacerbations by 32%-45%, and emergency department visits by 55%-84% (55,56). The most common adverse event is temporary worsening of respiratory symptoms with an 8.4%-13.2% periprocedural risk of hospitalization over a set of three treatments (55,56).\nThe conventional approach treats the right lower lobe in the first session, left lower lobe in the second session, and both upper lobes in the third session. A recent prospective study evaluated hyperpolarized xenon-129 ( 129 Xe) MRI in guiding therapy to specific airways (Fig 18) (57). The most poorly ventilated regions were targeted during the first BT session, and the remaining airways were treated during the second and third sessions. The results showed that a single BT treatment guided by  129 Xe MRI provided similar\nshort-term quality-of-life improvements as those of a standard three-session BT.\nIn patients with acute symptoms after BT, imaging abnormalities usually occur in the treated zones but have been reported in nontarget lobes. A prospective study of 12 patients found acute abnormalities on all 36 posttreatment CT images, with most resolving by 6 weeks (58). The most common finding was peribronchial consolidation or ground-glass opacities (94%), followed by partial bronchial occlusion (63%), atelectasis (38%), and bronchial dilatation (19%). Another study found septal thickening on 39% of images and pleural effusions on 68% of images (59).",

A meta-analysis comparing percutaneous and surgical approaches showed decreased rates of wound infection and increased likelihood of mucus plugging and accidental dislodgement with percutaneous tracheostomy but otherwise no clear safety difference (62). Other potential early complications of percutaneous tracheostomy include bleeding, subcutaneous emphysema, and false lumen insertion.

It can be performed under moderate sedation in an ambulatory setting and offers a diagnostic efficiency of 93.3% (64). It should be considered when thoracentesis and closed pleural\nbiopsy cannot help establish a diagnosis for an exudative pleural effusion.\nChemical pleurodesis and indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) are the main palliative treatment options for symptomatic and recurrent malignant pleural effusions. Instillation of sterile talc, the sclerosant of choice for chemical pleurodesis, into the pleural space causes an inflammatory reaction, resulting in pleural adhesions that prevent reaccumulation of pleural fluid in about 75% of cases (65). Talc pleurodesis is not recommended in cases of trapped lung. Pain is the most common side effect, and patients may be hospitalized for several days while undergoing suction. CT images show high-attenuation pleural accumulations of talc, which may be hypermetabolic at PET because of pleural inflammation (Fig 20). Ipsilateral reexpansion and pneumonitis are potential imaging complications (66).\nCompared with talc pleurodesis, IPCs offer better symptom control and shorter hospitalization time without significantly affecting complication rates or mortality (67). Patients typically drain their IPCs two to three times per week at home. Some IPCs can be removed after spontaneous pleurodesis, which may take several months. A rapid pleurodesis protocol combines medical thoracoscopy with talc instillation and simultaneous IPC placement, reducing hospital stay and IPC duration (68). IPCs can also be used in refractory nonmalignant pleural effusions due to heart failure or cirrhosis. IPC-related pleural infection occurs in about 3.7% of patients (69). Other potential complications include pneumothorax, catheter tract metastases, and cellulitis.\nTypical radiographic findings after IPC placement are decreased pleural fluid and reexpansion pulmonary edema. Pneumothorax is the main complication. Occasionally, the\nipsilateral lung cannot re-expand because of CAO or visceral pleural scarring (trapped lung) or tumor (lung entrapment). Lung volume remains unchanged, and loculated gas conforms to the space that was previously occupied by the pleural effusion (Fig 21). Unlike pneumothorax due to air leak, no specific management is indicated. Visceral pleural thickening at CT may help differentiate the two.",
