Incidental lung lesions are increasingly common given the rapid rise in the use of chest computed tomography for a variety of indications. 1 Coupled with the recent evidence from the National Lung Screening Trial supporting the use of low-dose CT screening for lung cancer, 2 there will likely be a signi /uniFB01 cant increase in the identi /uniFB01 cation of patients with suspicious lung lesions that require diagnostic evaluation.\nBronchoscopy is often the initial diagnostic procedure performed in patients with suspected lung cancer, and can provide a de /uniFB01 nitive diagnosis and allows for simultaneous staging. 3 Despite advances such as navigational and ultrathin bronchoscopy and peripheral endobronchial ultrasound, 4 the sensitivity of bronchoscopy for smaller, peripherally located nodules is limited. 5 Given its limited sensitivity and low negative predictive value, a bronchoscopy that does not provide a de /uniFB01 nitive diagnosis of cancer frequently leads to additional invasive testing, such as transthoracic needle biopsy (TTNB) or surgical lung biopsy. In patients with a low to intermediate probability of cancer and an inconclusive bronchoscopy, the decision of whether to pursue additional invasive testing or follow a plan of watchful waiting can be a dif /uniFB01 cult one. It requires balancing the risks of invasive procedures in patients who may have a benign lesion with the possibility of a delayed lung cancer diagnosis. 6\nRecently a bronchial genomic classi /uniFB01 er was validated in two prospective multicenter studies and was shown to improve the sensitivity of bronchoscopy and better identify patients who are at low probability ( < 10%) of lung cancer after an inconclusive bronchoscopy. 7,8 The classi /uniFB01 er is based on analysis of gene expression\nmeasured in cytologically normal-appearing bronchial epithelial cells collected from a mainstem bronchus at the time of bronchoscopy. 7,8 The classi /uniFB01 er does not require direct sampling of the lung lesion, but instead detects changes in lung cancer-associated gene expression occurring in the airway ' /uniFB01 eld of injury. ' 9,10 In patients with a low or intermediate risk of cancer, the classi /uniFB01 er achieved a sensitivity of 88% and speci /uniFB01 city of 52%. The sensitivity of the classi /uniFB01 er was similar across different histologies and stages of lung cancer and different lesion sizes. When bronchoscopy did not result in a diagnosis of cancer, the observed rate of lung cancer for patients with a negative classi /uniFB01 er result was low (9%) among patients at intermediate pretest probability of cancer (de /uniFB01 ned as 10% to 60%), and very low (0%) among patients with a low pretest probability (de /uniFB01 ned as < 10%). 8\nAlthough these previous studies establish clinical validity of the genomic classi /uniFB01 er, 7,8 the clinical utility of this test has not been established. The performance of the classi /uniFB01 er suggests that a negative score would support a more conservative diagnostic approach in patients with a low and intermediate pretest probability and has the potential to reduce the use of invasive procedures in patients who are likely to have benign disease. The present study examines the rate of invasive diagnostic procedures observed in the AEGIS trials 7,8 with a low or intermediate pretest probability of cancer as it is this population in which additional diagnostic testing after an inconclusive bronchoscopy is frequently performed and a biomarker with high negative predictive value may result in greater utilization of surveillance imaging. We also estimate the ability of the classi /uniFB01 er to reduce the rate of invasive procedures in patients ultimately diagnosed with benign disease.",

Among the 153 total patients with benign disease (including 84 patients with intermediate and 69 patients with low pretest probability), 83 (54%) had a negative classi /uniFB01 er result, yielding a reduction in the posttest probability of cancer (Fig 3A).

      "content": "In this study, we examined the rate of invasive diagnostic procedures among current and former smokers with low and intermediate pretest probability of cancer after an inconclusive bronchoscopy. We found\nthat there is a relatively high frequency of invasive diagnostic procedures in this clinical setting (41% overall), with a majority of those procedures occurring in patients ultimately diagnosed with benign disease. Our estimates suggest that a signi /uniFB01 cant proportion of invasive procedures could be avoided after an inconclusive bronchoscopy with the use of the genomic classi /uniFB01 er.\nSubsequent invasive procedures after an inconclusive bronchoscopy have the potential for substantial morbidity from procedural complications. In this study 50% of surgical lung biopsies were performed in patients with benign disease. This rate is consistent with the rate of surgical biopsies resulting in a diagnosis of benign disease seen in lung cancer screening studies and in a population-based study of lung nodule management. 2,11-14 Surgical lung biopsy has a moderate complication rate and a 30-day mortality of approximately 1%. 15,16 TTNB is also associated with substantial complications, including a 15% rate of pneumothorax and a 6% rate of pneumothorax\nrequiring chest tube drainage. 17-19 The classi /uniFB01 er will likely result in a reduction in invasive procedure utilization in patients with low and intermediate pretest probability lesions, the majority of whom have benign disease. Fifty-four percent of patients with benign disease and an inconclusive bronchoscopy had a negative classi /uniFB01 er result, enabling a lower postclassi /uniFB01 er probability of cancer, which could facilitate the decision by physicians to recommend watchful waiting rather than proceed with another invasive procedure. Of the patients with benign disease who subsequently underwent additional procedures, 50% had a negative classi /uniFB01 er result. The primary clinical value of the bronchial genomic classi /uniFB01 er is conferred on patients with an intermediate probability and an inconclusive bronchoscopy in whom a negative classi /uniFB01 er results in a low posttest likelihood of lung cancer. The classi /uniFB01 er may also be useful in patients with a low pretest probability as the majority (87%) who went on to an invasive procedure had a negative classi /uniFB01 er result and were ultimately diagnosed with benign disease.\nIn the current study, 4 (11%) of 35 patients with lung cancer had a negative classi /uniFB01 er result (false negatives) and may have experienced a delayed diagnosis if they were followed with surveillance imaging as a result of the classi /uniFB01 er. However, we found that in the absence of the classi /uniFB01 er, 20% (7 of 35) of patients with lung cancer and an inconclusive bronchoscopy were not diagnosed\nwithin 3 months after their initial procedure because of a decision to pursue surveillance imaging prior to the decision to pursue additional procedures. The low rate of false-negative results observed with the classi /uniFB01 er may result in a modest increase in the number of patients with lung cancer who undergo surveillance prior to additional invasive evaluation. If patients with a negative classi /uniFB01 er are evaluated with serial imaging (ie, repeat scan at 3 months) there should not be a lengthy delay in identifying lesions that are growing that should proceed to another biopsy.\nAlthough the AEGIS trials provided us with a unique opportunity to estimate the clinical utility of the bronchial genomic classi /uniFB01 er, there are a number of important limitations to our study. In our current analysis we estimated the ability of the classi /uniFB01 er to decrease subsequent invasive procedure utilization. This approach rests on the underlying assumption that a negative classi /uniFB01 er result would have been suf /uniFB01 cient to warrant a more conservative diagnostic evaluation in patients who would have otherwise been sent for an invasive procedure. Our study was not designed to assess the factors associated with physicians ' decisions to pursue additional invasive procedures. In addition, as physicians were blinded to results of the classi /uniFB01 er we are unable to directly evaluate the actual impact of that classi /uniFB01 er on their decision making. In some patients with a negative classi /uniFB01 er result, physicians may still choose to proceed with further invasive testing. We also did not estimate the effect that patient preferences may have on subsequent invasive procedure utilization after an inconclusive bronchoscopy. Importantly, we were unable to evaluate whether some of the invasive procedures in patients with benign disease resulted in a diagnosis that altered clinical management of that patient, providing clinically useful results to the physician.\nGiven that these observational studies did not mandate that subsequent evaluation after bronchoscopy occur at the study center, there may have been additional invasive procedures performed that are not accounted for in our data. The studies were limited to 12 months of clinical follow-up after the index bronchoscopy. We do not believe that we missed a signi /uniFB01 cant number of lung cancers that would have been found with an additional year of follow-up. The high sensitivity of CT to detect nodule growth makes it unlikely that solid nodules that are stable for 12 months will grow subsequently. This is supported by lung cancer screening studies that showed only 1 of 1000 nodules that were\n]\nstable in the /uniFB01 rst year were determined to be malignant in the second year of follow-up. 13 Finally, we used data from all patients enrolled in both trials given the similar accuracy estimates observed in the training and test sets. As our goal was to estimate downstream procedure use after an index bronchoscopy, the similar area under the curve estimates allowed for this approach to increase statistical power.\nThere are a number of strengths to our study that contribute to the potential impact of our /uniFB01 ndings. First, we leveraged two large multicenter studies that enabled us to include geographically diverse academic and community practices in our estimate of invasive procedure use. Second, our data were collected in a clinical setting identical to that in which the classi /uniFB01 er would be used (before diagnosis), allowing us to better estimate the potential clinical utility of the test. Third, we limited these studies to patients with low and intermediate pretest probability in whom physicians are most uncertain about the likelihood of cancer and in whom the classi /uniFB01 er holds the greatest ability to\nalter clinical decision making. Finally, the probability of cancer was based on a physician ' s subjective assessment (as opposed to risk prediction models), which both mirrors clinical practice and was shown to re /uniFB02 ect cancer prevalence rates in the AEGIS trials. 8\nIn summary, there is a high frequency of invasive procedures performed in patients with a low or intermediate pretest probability of lung cancer after an inconclusive bronchoscopy, and a majority of these procedures are performed in patients ultimately diagnosed with benign disease. This analysis suggests that using the bronchial genomic classi /uniFB01 er during bronchoscopy may reduce invasive procedures in this population. Future studies should attempt to con /uniFB01 rm reductions in invasive procedures that result from the /uniFB01 nding of a negative genomic classi /uniFB01 er that prompts a physician to pursue serial imaging surveillance after an inconclusive bronchoscopy, as well as examine the impact of the classi /uniFB01 er on cancer end points such as stage at diagnosis and the impact on costs and patient-reported outcomes.",
