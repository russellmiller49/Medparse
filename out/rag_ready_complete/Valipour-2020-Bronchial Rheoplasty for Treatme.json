    "abstract": "Rationale: Chronic bronchitis (CB) is characterized by productive cough with excessive mucus production, resulting in quality-of-life impairment and increased exacerbation risk. Bronchial rheoplasty uses an endobronchial catheter to apply nonthermal pulsed electrical /uniFB01 elds to the airways. Preclinical studies have demonstrated epithelial ablation followed by regeneration of normalized epithelium. Objectives: Toevaluate the feasibility, safety, and initial outcomes of bronchial rheoplasty in patients with CB. Methods: Pooled analysis of two separate studies enrolling 30 patients undergoing bilateral bronchial rheoplasty was conducted. Follow-up through 6 months (primary outcome) and 12 months included assessment of adverse events, airway histology, and changes in symptoms using the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) Assessment Test and St. George ' s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Measurements and Main Results: Bronchial rheoplasty was performed in all 30 patients (63% male; mean [SD] age, 67 [7.4]; mean [SD] postbronchodilator FEV1, 65% [21%]; mean [SD] Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Assessment Test score 25.6 [7.1]; mean [SD] SGRQ score, 59.6 [15.3]). There were no device-related and four procedurerelated serious adverse events through 6 months, and there were none thereafter through 12 months. The most frequent nonserious, device- and/or procedure-related event through 6 months was mild hemoptysis in 47% (14 of 30) patients. Histologically, the mean goblet cell hyperplasia score was reduced by a statistically signi /uniFB01 cant amount ( P , 0.001). Signi /uniFB01 cant changes from baseline to 6 months in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Assessment Test (mean, 2 7.9; median, 2 8.0; P =0.0002) and SGRQ (mean, 2 14.6; median, 2 7.2; P =0.0002) scores were observed, with similar observations through 12 months. Conclusions: This study provides the /uniFB01 rst clinical evidence of the feasibility, safety, and initial outcomes of bronchial rheoplasty in symptomatic patients with CB. Clinical trial registered with www.anzctr.org.au (ACTRN 12617000330347) and clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 03107494). Two prospective, multicenter, single-arm clinical studies under two nearly identical protocols, differing mainly by local speci /uniFB01 cations and requirements (Australia: ACTRN 12617000330347; Austria and Chile: NCT 03107494), were conducted in patients with diagnosed CB. The study informed-consent forms were approved by the local ethics committee at each study center. All patients provided written informed consent before screening. Patients were recruited at /uniFB01 ve tertiary academic centers in Austria, Australia, and Chile between February 2017 and October 2018. The study population included adult patients who were at least 40 years of age and had a smoking history of at least 10 pack-years, with CB de /uniFB01 ned as a productive cough for 3 months in each of 2 successive years, and in whom other causes of productive cough had been excluded. The initial protocol required patients to have a post-bronchodilator FEV1 of > 30% and < 80% of predicted volume within 3 months of enrollment, together with a FEV1/FVC ratio , 0.70. Early during the enrollment period, however, it was noted that there was a signi /uniFB01 cant number of patients suffering from signi /uniFB01 cant CB symptoms who had relatively normal lung function (FEV1/FVC ratio > 0.7 or FEV1 . 80%) but otherwise appeared to be good candidates for bronchial rheoplasty. The protocol was amended to remove the FEV1/FVC ratio criterion and to allow enrollment of patients with FEV1 . 80% if they had a Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Assessment Test (CAT) total score > 10 and the /uniFB01 rst two items on their CAT ( ' I never cough ' vs. ' I cough all the time ' and ' I have no phlegm in my chest at all ' vs. ' My chest is full of phlegm ' ) summed to a score > 7 points. Exclusion criteria included oral steroid -dependent conditions ( . 10 mg/d), active respiratory infection, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation within 6 weeks before treatment, abnormal cardiac rhythm at the time of the /uniFB01 rst procedure, history of arrhythmia within the past 2 years, presence of implantable cardiac devices, prior lung surgery, history of asthma before age 30, and current smoking (within 6 mo of treatment).

The predominant subtypes of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) include emphysema and chronic bronchitis (CB). CB is de /uniFB01 ned as chronic cough and sputum production for 3 mo/yr for 2 consecutive years. The pathophysiology of CB is chronic in /uniFB02 ammation of the respiratory tract, leading to overproduction and hypersecretion of mucus together with impaired mucociliary clearance (2 -4). As a result, patients with CB report symptoms such as persistent cough, production of phlegm, and/or shortness of breath. The diagnosis of CB is associated with more frequent and severe exacerbations, quality-of-life impairments, and increased morbidity and mortality (5 -11). The prevalence of CB in the adult population ranges from 3.4% to 22.0%, depending on the de /uniFB01 nition used, and affects smokers with and without Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (12, 13). In fact, previous studies suggest that symptoms of\nCB may predict the development of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (13 -16).\nDespite the impact of CB on morbidity and mortality, little progress has been made in developing effective therapies. Common therapies in managing Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including inhaled b 2-agonists, anticholinergics, and glucocorticoids, have either not been studied speci /uniFB01 cally in the CB subtype or have yielded con /uniFB02 icting results (12). Ro /uniFB02 umilast (a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor) has been shown to be effective in treating CB, but side effects limit its use in clinical practice (17, 18). Despite guidelinedirected therapy, many patients with CB remain signi /uniFB01 cantly symptomatic.\nBronchial rheoplasty is a procedure that uses nonthermal pulsed electrical /uniFB01 elds with the intention of ablating the abnormal mucus-producing cells of the airway epithelium, thereby allowing normal, healthy epithelial regeneration to occur. The current study evaluates the technical feasibility, safety, and initial outcomes of this therapy in patients with CB. Some of the results of this study have been previously reported in the form of abstracts (19 -21).",

This targeted energy delivery is intended to cause cell death by disrupting cellular homeostasis, leading to processes such as osmotic swelling and apoptosis (19 -21). This cell death does not destroy the architectural function of the tissue, permitting subsequent regeneration of normalized epithelium and a reduction in airway mucus production.

      "content": "This study provides proof of concept for the safety and technical feasibility of bronchial rheoplasty, an endoscopic technique using nonthermal pulsed electrical /uniFB01 elds to ablate airway mucosa and reduce airway mucus production in the treatment of CB. Reductions in goblet cell hyperplasia and changes in patient-reported quality-of-life measures were observed after the procedure.\nelectrode is expanded to circumferentially contact the airway wall using the catheterhandle mechanism. The generator is then activated to deliver energy to the airway over approximately 5 seconds. The catheter is then collapsed and redeployed at the next target location adjacent to the prior activation, and, once again, energy is delivered. This sequence is repeated until all of the accessible airway mucosa has been treated. The operator treats from the subsegmental airways to the main carina. All accessible lobar segments and subsegments are treated. A minimum number of activations per procedure was not prespeci /uniFB01 ed in the study protocol. It was assumed that the number of activations would depend on the accessibility and dimensions of the airways. Additional procedural details are provided in the online supplement.\nDuring the /uniFB01 rst bronchoscopic session, endobronchial cryobiopsy samples (Erbe Elektromedizin GmbH, T¨ ubingen, Germany) of the airway mucosa were acquired from multiple standardized regions ( see online supplement for description of sampling techniques) of the right bronchial airways, followed by treatment of the right lung. The second bronchoscopic session, including (baseline) endobronchial cryobiopsy and treatment of the left lung, was scheduled at approximately 1 month after the initial treatment to allow for patients to recover from the initial procedure. A third bronchoscopy was performed, for bilateralairway biopsy-sample collection only, 3 months after the second treatment; treatment was not administered at this visit. Patients were observed and discharged per the standard of care of the treating institution. Periprocedural corticosteroids and/or antibiotics (intravenous or oral) were permitted if deemed medically necessary by the treating physician. Followup visits were scheduled at 1 week (phone call) and 1 month after the /uniFB01 rst treatment and at 1 week (phone call) and 3, 6, and 12 months after the second treatment. A comprehensive schedule of study events is provided in Table E1.\nHistological samples from the right bronchus intermedius and the left lower lobe were formalin /uniFB01 xed, paraf /uniFB01 n embedded, and sectioned per standard histology protocols. Hematoxylin and eosin -and periodic acid -Schiff -stained slides were reviewed by a board-certi /uniFB01 ed\nanatomic pathologist with subspecialty expertise in pulmonary pathology. The pathologist graded the degree of epithelial goblet cell hyperplasia using a prespeci /uniFB01 ed, semiquantitative methodology consisting of a categorical scale, described in detail in Figure E2.

Events thereafter were de /uniFB01 ned as occurring during the 3-, 6-, or 12-month periods after the second treatment, excluding the treatment recovery period. Spirometry testing (FEV1 and FVC) was incorporated as an additional safety measure.\nFurther outcomes included evaluation of the effects of bronchial rheoplasty on goblet cell hyperplasia score and diseaserelated symptoms and quality of life using CAT and St. George ' s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total scores. Goblet cell hyperplasia was assessed at 3 months after the second procedure. CAT and SGRQ scores were collected at baseline and at 3, 6 (primary assessment), and 12 months after the second procedure visit, and responder rates were calculated using 2-point and 4-point thresholds for CAT (22) and SGRQ (23), respectively.",

The most frequently reported SAE was Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation (13.3%, 4 of 30 patients). There was one case of atrial /uniFB01 brillation 1 week after the procedure, judged by the investigator to be unrelated to the procedure or device but instead related to an unreported preexisting condition exacerbated by alcohol consumption. This event resolved without sequelae 1 day later after prescription of an intravenous b -blocker. No acute cardiac rhythm abnormalities occurred during the procedure in any patient. One patient died of end-stage Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), unrelated to either the device or the procedure, 381 days after the second procedure.\nNonserious device-related and procedure-related AEs through 12 months are presented in Tables E3 and E4, respectively. The majority (85%) of these events occurred during the treatment recovery period. The most frequent nonserious AEs that were device and/or procedure related were Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations (30%, 9 of 30 patients), which were generally moderate in severity and successfully treated with antibiotic and/or systemic steroid therapy; mild hemoptysis (47%, 14 of 30 patients); and sore throat (33%, 10 of 30 patients).

No unexpected AEs related to the device or procedure were reported during the study.\nModerate and severe COPDexacerbation event rates during the study, de /uniFB01 ned as the number of events per patientyear of follow-up, were 1.20 (SD, 1.30) and 0.21 (SD, 0.60), respectively.\nThere were no statistically signi /uniFB01 cant changes in lung-function parameters (FEV1, FVC) at 3, 6, or 12 months after the procedure compared with baseline.",

      "content": "Bronchial rheoplasty is an endoscopic technique that uses nonthermal pulsed electrical /uniFB01 elds to ablate the airway mucosa and mucus-producing cells of\nthe airway epithelium. On the basis of preclinical research in animals, the local extracellular matrix is left intact after the procedure (19 -21), which is believed to promote healthier regeneration of the epithelium.\nThis initial study of bronchial rheoplasty demonstrated that the procedure is technically feasible, with an acceptable safety pro /uniFB01 le. Pulsed electrical /uniFB01 elds were delivered from the main bronchus to the subsegmental airways, the airways most likely to contain goblet cells. The histological /uniFB01 ndings appear to con /uniFB01 rm the proposed mechanism of action, demonstrating a statistically signi /uniFB01 cant reduction in the number of epithelial goblet cells, particularly in those patients with pretreatment evidence of moderate-to-severe goblet cell hyperplasia. These observations were accompanied by statistically signi /uniFB01 cant reductions in CAT and SGRQ scores through 12 months.\nThe above /uniFB01 ndings were observed in the presence of an acceptable safety pro /uniFB01 le. No patients experienced a device-related SAE, and four patients experienced a procedure-related SAE, each of which resolved without sequelae. No device- or procedure-related SAEs were observed beyond 3 months. Given that the RheOx System delivers high-voltage energy to the airways in close proximity to the heart, monitoring for cardiac arrythmias was of particular interest in characterizing safety. No acute cardiac rhythm abnormalities occurred during the procedure in any patient. One patient developed atrial /uniFB01 brillation 1 week after the procedure, which was, however, considered to be unrelated to the device or procedure. This patient failed to report a history of prior atrial /uniFB01 brillation, which may have been exacerbated by general anesthesia, the procedure, and/or the patient ' s\nbehavior (i.e., signi /uniFB01 cant alcohol consumption).\nThere was a 30% rate of nonserious, moderate Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations during the treatment recovery period. The overall rates of moderate and severe Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations in the present study were 1.20 and 0.21 events per patient-year, respectively. These rates appear to be similar to those of a cross-sectional analysis of 112 French patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a CB phenotype, in which reported moderate and severe Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation rates were 1.80 and 0.43 events per patient-year, respectively (25). Nevertheless, we acknowledge that the occurrence of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations may in part have been in /uniFB02 uenced by the bronchoscopic interventions, which included multiple cryobiopsies. To put this rate into context, an analysis of the SPIROMICS\n(Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Study) trial demonstrated a 27% rate of respiratory complications after research bronchoscopy performed in patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (26).\nSpirometry was performed primarily for safety reasons and was unaffected by the procedure. Given the absence of a relationship between goblet cell density and classic markers of lung function (FEV1 and FVC) in a previous report (27), we did not expect to observe substantive changes in these measures. Improvements in CB symptoms may better correlate with small airway function and are better measured with impulse oscillometry, body plethysmography, and/or computed tomography -derived parameters, such as airway count and/or airway volumes (28 -30).\nFew other interventional device systems have been developed to ablate the abnormal airway epithelium and mucosa in patients with obstructive airway disease. In contrast to bronchial rheoplasty, these systems deliver thermal energy to achieve changes in airway pathology. Bronchial thermoplasty is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration -approved procedure that uses radiofrequency energy to reduce airway smooth muscle mass through bronchoscopy to all visible airways.

Bronchial thermoplasty, however, has not yet been studied in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nMore recently, metered cryospray therapy has been introduced to ablate airway mucosa in patients with CB. Five out of 11 patients scheduled to undergo surgery for lung cancer underwent this endoscopic approach, followed by lung resection and\nassessments of airway histology at 2 weeks (32). Similar to /uniFB01 ndings in the present study, reepithelialization at the treatment site was observed in that report. However, because of the lack of published safety, histology, and outcome data beyond 2 weeks, it is not possible to draw further conclusions or otherwise compare these current technologies.\nWith any new interventional technique, however, careful patient selection\nis one of the most important considerations. Patients were selected for this study using a high CB symptom threshold, as determined by the /uniFB01 rst two items of the CAT instrument (cough and phlegm or mucus). Although there is no agreed-on method for staging patients with CB, several de /uniFB01 nitions have been used (27, 33), and higher scores on the /uniFB01 rst two CAT items have been correlated with worse quality-of-life scores, lower FEV1 and FVC, worse computed tomography -derived airway parameters,\nTable presents changes from baseline to 90 days and 120 days after the procedure for the left and right lungs, respectively. One biopsy sample is assessed for each lung at each of the two time points (baseline and follow-up).\n*Graded on a 4-point scale in which 0 = normal ratio of goblet cells to ciliated bronchial epithelial cells (1 goblet cell per 10 or more bronchial epithelial cells); 1 = mild goblet cell hyperplasia (1 goblet cell per approximately 3-10 ciliated bronchial epithelial cells); 2 = moderate goblet cell hyperplasia (approaching 1 goblet cell per ciliated bronchial epithelial cell); and 3 = severe goblet cell hyperplasia ( . 1 goblet cell per ciliated bronchial epithelial cell).\n0\nBaseline\n3 Months\n6 Months\n12 Months\n10\nOverall (Friedman's test):\np=0.0008\np=0.0002\np<0.0001\nPairwise:\np=0.0001\n20\n30\n40\nCAT Total Score\nMean\nA\nand more frequent Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-related hospitalizations (33). In our study, the /uniFB01 nal protocol versions did not require a Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) diagnosis based on pulmonary function tests. Patients with preserved lung function were allowed if they met other study criteria, including the CB symptom thresholds. During the enrollment phase, we identi /uniFB01 ed a signi /uniFB01 cant number of patients suffering from signi /uniFB01 cant CB symptoms who had relatively normal lung function (FEV1/FVC ratio > 0.7) and were thus deemed to be good candidates for bronchial rheoplasty. This is consistent with recent studies that have shown that smokers and former smokers with chronic respiratory symptoms of chronic mucus hypersecretion, cough, and dyspnea, but relatively normal spirometry, constitute a signi /uniFB01 cant proportion of clinical consultations (13, 34) and that these individuals may have early stages of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) not yet evidenced by air /uniFB02 ow limitation (35), representing a signi /uniFB01 cant unmet clinical need. Çolak and colleagues (13) also showed that chronic respiratory symptoms are associated with respiratory hospitalizations and death in individuals with normal spirometry.\nAs an initial safety and feasibility study, this study had limitations that included a small sample size and lack of a control group. Although the observed changes in airway histology and the observed /uniFB01 ndings in CAT and SGRQ scores suggest a\ntreatment effect warranting further investigation, we cannot rule out the potential in /uniFB02 uence of an intervention or placebo effect on patient-reported outcomes. In a randomized controlled trial of targeted lung denervation in patients with moderate-to-severe Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), mean changes in SGRQ of 2 3.8 and 2 2.5 points at 6 and 12 months were observed, respectively, in the group of patients who underwent sham bronchoscopy (36). Similar results have been reported in other blinded studies evaluating endoscopic interventions in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), with changes in CAT and SGRQ data with bronchoscopy alone in the range between 0 and 2 3.7 points (37, 38). Additional limitations of the current study are that the goblet cell hyperplasia scoring was performed by a single pathologist and that the semiquantitative scale has not been validated. Furthermore, given the sample size of the current study, we were not able to calculate an intrarater variability of the histological reads. A randomly selected subset of 20 of the 54 samples were, however, regraded by the pathologist in a blinded fashion, resulting in a similarly statistically signi /uniFB01 cant reduction of the goblet cell hyperplasia score ( P =0.0013, data not shown). That said, and though no standardized scoring system has been developed for assessing changes in airway biopsy samples in CB, a similar 4-point scale was employed by Gordon and colleagues (39) when assessing goblet cell hyperplasia in biopsy samples collected\nfrom asthma patients treated with bronchial thermoplasty. Moreover, previous reports have shown that goblet cell density -a comparable measure to the one used in our study -in endobronchial biopsy samples correlated well with smoking history (3, 27) and was better at discriminating mucosal pathology than mucin-volume density (27). Other established markers of submucosal gland hypertrophy, such as the Reid Index, failed to show any differences between those with CB and those without (40, 41) and were therefore not used. Finally, it is not known whether a bilateral treatment during a single procedure would potentially decrease the total risk of procedure-related events by reducing the number of airway interventions.\nIn summary, this study provides the /uniFB01 rst clinical evidence of the feasibility, safety, and initial outcomes of bronchial rheoplasty in symptomatic patients with CB. n\nAuthor disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org.\nAcknowledgment: The authors thank Gala Therapeutics for providing support for this study, including data analysis and administrative and logistical support in coordinating the study across the study sites.
