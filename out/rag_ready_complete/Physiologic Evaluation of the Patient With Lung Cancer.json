      "content": "The goal of this article is to update previous recommendations on the preoperative physiologic evaluation of patients with lung cancer being considered for curative-intent surgery. 2,3   A  formal process was followed. The topic editor and writing committee drafted evidence questions using a population, intervention, comparator or control group, outcome (PICO) format whenever possible. These PICO questions can be accessed in the online supplementary materials for each article where they were developed. Outcomes were restricted to those that are patient important, not simply research focused. Searches occurred for relevant clinical evidence, mostly in the form of original research or systematic reviews. Original research included all levels of evidence (randomized controlled trials as well as observational studies), as long as they appeared in peer-reviewed publications, which was the minimal threshold.\nThe  PICO  questions  then  informed  the  search  strategies, which are available upon request. The writing committee conducted their literature searches in PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus. Searches were not limited by publication date; however, most covered the period 2005 to the present. The references in the second edition of the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) Lung Cancer Guidelines were used for the majority of articles written before 2005.\nRecommendations were developed by the writing committee, graded by a standardized method (see the article by Lewis et al, 1 'Methodology  for  Guidelines  for  Lung  Cancer,'  in  the  ACCP Lung Cancer Guidelines),   and were reviewed by all members of the Lung Cancer Panel and the Thoracic Oncology Network prior to approval by the Guidelines Oversight Committee and the Board of Regents of the ACCP.\nAlthough numerous reviews have been published on the preoperative risk assessment of patients with lung cancer being considered for curative-intent surgical resection, 4-9  most available guidelines on the management of non-small cell lung cancer do not address the preoperative evaluation process. 10-16   The British Thoracic Society, 17  the ACCP,  3  and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) jointly with the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons (ESTS)  18  have provided two guidelines with specifi  c recommendations on the steps needed to evaluate preoperative risk. The recommendations of these guidelines follow a similar approach, relying on physiologic testing to estimate perioperative risk and the effect of resection on postoperative lung function.",

These patients may be at increased risk  of  both  immediate  perioperative  complications and long-term disability following curative-intent surgical resection of their lung cancer. Cigarette smoking also predisposes these patients to other comorbid conditions, specifi  cally atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, which further increases perioperative risk. Consequently, in considering whether a patient should undergo curative-intent surgical resection of lung cancer, the possible short-term perioperative risk from comorbid cardiopulmonary disease and the long-term risk of pulmonary disability must be balanced against the possible risk of reduced survival if an oncologically suboptimal treatment strategy is chosen.\nThe task of the preoperative physiologic assessment is to identify patients at increased risk of both perioperative complications and long-term disability\nsubstantially reduce the perioperative risk and the physiologic impact and to provide comparable or even superior oncologic results. The responsible physician should also keep in mind and discuss nonsurgical treatment alternatives, such as conventional radiotherapy, stereotactic radiotherapy, and radiofrequency ablation, if the risk of surgery is deemed unacceptably high by both surgeon and patient.",

      "content": "The prevalence of lung cancer increases with age. In North America it has been estimated that the prevalence of lung cancer increases from 14 per 100,000 population at age 40 years to 477 per 100,000 pop  ulation at age 70 years for men. For women, it increases from 16  per  100,000  population  at  age  40  to  342  per 100,000 population at age 70 years. Approximately 30% to 35% of candidates for lung resection for lung cancer are . 70 years of age, as reported in the most recent Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) and ESTS general thoracic surgery databases. Although age has been traditionally considered a risk factor  , the most recent guidelines have emphasized that age alone is not a contraindication to surgery. 3,18   The increased surgical risk, which may be observed in elderly patients, is probably a function of the underlying comorbidities. In this regard, the ERS-ESTS guidelines have recommended that the cardiopulmonary fi  tness of elderly patients with lung cancer be fully evaluated without any prejudice regarding age. 18  A similar recommendation has been proposed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer elderly task force and the Lung Cancer Group, and by the International Society for Geriatric Oncology in a joint expert opinion paper. 29  They advised that surgery in the early stages of disease not be dismissed based solely on chronologic age.\nFactors such as tumor stage, patient life expectancy, performance status, and presence of underlying comorbidities should be taken into account in the surgical  decision-making  process.  Careful  patient selection with preoperative evaluation is mandatory, however, and could signifi  cantly improve the results. Evidence  30-40   has shown that for patients . 80 years old,  reported  average  mortality  is  between  0%  and 9%; however, it should be kept in mind that in most series the most frequent operation was lobectomy or sublobar resections. Very elderly patients have reduced resection rates 40-42  and are more frequently submitted to sublobar resections rather than lobectomy. Relative long-term survival of very elderly patients appears to be comparable to younger ones in some studies, 34,40,42  but not in others in which survival in patients . 80 was shorter than in younger patients. 41,43,44  In general, reported 5-year survival in\nare more likely to have histologic confi  rmation of lung cancer  and  referral  for  potentially  curative  treatment.  19,20   Evaluation  by  a  multidisciplinary  team, which includes a thoracic surgeon specializing in lung cancer, a medical oncologist, a radiation oncologist, and a pulmonologist, as is the practice now in many countries, is important in the assessment of risk and benefi  t of curative-intent surgery. Multidisciplinary input is especially useful in patients who are marginal surgical candidates as a basis for discussing the proposed surgical procedure and treatment options with the patient and appropriate family or surrogates.\nT wo of the eight comparative studies included in a systematic review 21  reported an improvement in survival in patients evaluated by a multidisciplinary team (in inoperable patients and in elderly patients, respectively). 22,23  Although the other studies did not fi  nd a difference in survival, three reported increased resection rates 24,25  and two reported increased rates of receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy. 22,23   Similar fi  ndings were noted in the two most recent observational reports, which showed that multidisciplinary team evaluation was associated with improved practice patterns (ie, pathologic diagnosis, receipt of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, complete staging, adherence to guidelines, and shorter interval from diagnosis to treatment). 26,27",

      "title": "2.2 Risk Thresholds",
      "content": "In presenting the option of curative-intent surgical therapy to a patient with lung cancer, it is important to recognize that risk assessment is a complex process. Risks related to standard surgical resection for lung cancer (lobectomy or greater removal of lung tissue) include  perioperative  morbidity  and  mortality  and long-term functional disability. Individual patient circumstances increase or decrease the risks of standard surgical resection. In this guideline, the effect on perioperative mortality, morbidity, residual functional status, and quality of life with curative lung cancer resection for various physiologic abnormalities is extrapolated from published data. However, patient preference as to the maximal acceptable surgical risk (eg, the threshold mortality rate above which the patient would not accept the procedure) should also be explored. Mathematical approaches, based on decision analysis techniques, have been useful for conceptually describing the interplay between risk and patient preference, but are not routinely used for individual patient care. 28  The use of minimally invasive thoracic surgery and sublobar anatomic resections (segmentectomy), whenever technically and oncologically feasible, needs to be taken into account when discussing the risk of surgery with the patient. In fact, both these techniques have been shown to\nneed for aggressive antiplatelet therapy, which is recommended for approximately 6 weeks after coronary angioplasty and/or a bare metal stent and for . 1 year after a drug-eluting stent, may represent a major surgical challenge, 57  although evidence has shown that patients who are receiving clopidogrel and who have a coronary artery stent placed can safely undergo general thoracic surgery without increased risk of bleeding  and  with  a  reduced  risk  of  perioperative myocardial infarction compared with control subjects undergoing surgery without antiplatelet therapy. 58\nb -Blockers are commonly used to reduce perioperative myocardial infarction. 59,60  However, a randomized trial has shown that commonly used b -blocker regimens  increase  the  risk  of  stroke,  presumably because of bradycardia and hypotension, and can increase overall mortality. 61  Therefore, we do not recommend starting a new perioperative b -blockade in patients with ischemic heart disease, but favor continuation  of b -blockers  in  patients  already  taking them. b -blockers may be benefi  cial as new therapy only in very high-risk patients, in whom their cardioprotective benefi  ts may outweigh their bradycardic and hypotensive effects. 62\nCardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) has been proposed as a useful tool for detecting both overt and occult exercise-induced myocardial ischemia, with a diagnostic accuracy similar to that of a single-photon emission  computed  tomographic  myocardial  perfusion  study 63-65   and  superior  to  standard  ECG  stress testing. 66  Several variables obtained during CPET, including oxygen consumption relative to heart rate and work rate, provide consistent, quantitative patterns of abnormal physiologic responses to graded exercise when left ventricular dysfunction is caused by myocardial ischemia. For this reason, CPET can be proposed as a noninvasive test to detect and quantify myocardial perfusion defects in patients at increased risk of coronary artery disease. In fact, in addition to providing information on the presence and severity of myocardial ischemia, it will provide data on peak oxygen consumption ( o 2 peak), a parameter that has been associated with postoperative outcome (see paragraph on CPET). We therefore recommend referral  of  patients  with  a  positive  cardiac  history  and increased cardiac risk for a CPET to better defi  ne the coronary reserve and cardiac function (  Fig 1  ).",

      "content": "Patients with lung cancer are predisposed to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease because of cigarette  smoking,  and  the  prevalence  of  underlying coronary artery disease is about 11% to 17%. 48,49  The risk of major postoperative cardiac complications, including myocardial ischemia, pulmonary edema, ventricular fi  brillation or primary cardiac arrest, complete heart block, and cardiac-related death, 50  is about 2% to 3% after lung resection. 48,49  As a consequence, a preoperative cardiovascular risk assessment should be performed. Guidelines have recommended the use of cardiac risk scores as a screening tool to select patients needing specialized preoperative cardiologic testing before proceeding to their surgical procedure. The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology  51  and the European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Anesthesiology guidelines 52   recommend  the  revised  cardiac  risk  index (RCRI)  50  as the preferred risk scoring tool to assess cardiac risk in patients undergoing noncardiac surgical procedures. Similarly, the joint ERS/ESTS task force on fi  tness for radical treatment of patients with lung cancer 18  endorsed these recommendations and proposed a cardiologic algorithm incorporating this scoring system as a preliminary screening instrument.\nHowever, the RCRI was originally derived from a mixed surgical population including only a minority of patients undergoing thoracic surgery. For this reason, this scoring system was recalibrated in a lung resection population, 48   and  the  recalibrated  score (defi  ned as thoracic RCRI [ThRCRI]) was then validated in external populations showing a good discrimination ability. 48,53   When using the cardiologic algorithm as a preliminary step in the functional workup of the lung resection candidate, it seems advisable to replace the traditional RCRI with the more specifi  c and recently revised ThRCRI (  Fig 1  ).\nIn summary, patients with ThRCRI . 1.5 or any cardiac  condition  requiring  medication  or  a  newly suspected cardiac condition or limited exercise tolerance (inability to climb two fl  ights of stairs) should be referred for a cardiac consultation. Noninvasive testing and treatments as per American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines 51,54 should be indicated in these patients (  Fig 1  ).\nOn the other hand, aggressive cardiac interventions should be reserved only for patients who need them irrespective of surgery, but interventions specifi  cally for surgery are of limited benefi  t. For example, prophylactic coronary revascularization has not been demonstrated to reduce risk. 55,56  Furthermore, the\non by board-certifi  ed, specialized thoracic surgeons, compared with general surgeons.  68-71  Some authors reported, in addition to reduced operative mortality, a longer survival 71   and increased resection rates 67 in\nand long-term survival. In fact, with the exception of one report, 67   most authors found reduced mortality rates (crude or adjusted for concomitant risk factors) when patients with lung cancer were operated\nmortality reported in the STS or ESTS general thoracic surgery databases are around 1.6% to 2.3% after lobectomy and 3.7% to 6.7% after pneumonectomy. These numbers are somewhat lower than reported previously. 79  Newer or refi  ned surgical techniques, such as the use of muscle-sparing and intercostal nerve-sparing thoracotomy,  91  video-assisted thoracos  copy, 92,93  and robotically assisted lung resection, 94 have certainly contributed to minimizing the postoperative risks of morbidity and reductions in lung function.  For  instance,  a  propensity-score  casematched analysis based on the data present in the STS general thoracic surgery database has shown a signifi  cantly lower incidence of complications and a shorter length of stay (4 days vs 6 days, P , .0001) compared with open lobectomy. 92  However, even with modern anesthetic, surgical, and postoperative care techniques, the risk of  perioperative  morbidity  and mortality following either lobectomy or pneumonectomy is still appreciable. The approach to estimating these risks from underlying cardiopulmonary disease is based on a preoperative physiologic assessment (see   Fig 1  ).",

      "content": "Spirometry, and in particular that of FEV 1 and predicted  postoperative  (PPO)  FEV 1 ,  has  traditionally represented the key test in the functional workup of surgical candidates with lung cancer. A reduced FEV 1 or PPO FEV 1 has been associated with increased respiratory morbidity and mortality rates. 95-101  Berry et al 95 showed that FEV 1 was an independent predictor of respiratory complications. Patients with a preoperative FEV 1 , 30% had an incidence of respiratory morbidity as high as 43%, whereas those with an FEV 1 . 60% had a morbidity rate of 12%. Ferguson et al 97  used classifi  cation and regression tree analysis and found that FEV 1 was an independent predictor of pulmonary morbidity (OR, 1.1 for every 10% decrease in FEV 1 ) and cardiovascular complications (OR, 1.13 for every 10% decrease in FEV 1 ). By using receiver-operating characteristic analysis, Licker et al 99  confi  rmed that the best cutoff value of FEV 1 for predicting respiratory complications was 60%.\nDespite these fi  ndings, guidelines 18  have questioned their pivotal roles in selecting patients for operation. This conclusion was based on a series of studies showing a limited role of these parameters in predicting complications in patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),  102,103 likely due to the so-called 'lobar volume reduction effect.' In patients with lung cancer and moderate to severe Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the resection of the most affected parenchyma may determine an improvement in respiratory  mechanics  and  elastic  recoil.  Several  studies have shown a minimal loss or even an improvement\npatients with lung cancer managed in hospitals with specialized thoracic surgeons.\nMany studies on the association between hospital procedural volume and outcome have been published. Most of the studies reported a favorable infl  uence of high surgical volume on operative mortality 72-80 ; however, this association was not confi  rmed by others. 81-85 Other studies found a better long-term survival associated with high-volume hospitals or surgeons. 74,78,80,86-88 Some studies have shown that surgeon's volume was more strongly associated with mortality than was hospital volume, 89 but others did not confi  rm this result 76,77 and found that hospital volume, rather than individual surgeon volume, was more linked to outcome. For lung resection, surgeon volume was found to be strongly correlated with hospital volume (ie, highvolume surgeons  tend  to  operate  in  high-volume hospitals). 76,77   Given the variable volume thresholds that have been used in the literature (ie, the defi  nition of high volume ranges from 20 to . 90 cases/y), it is diffi  cult to identify a minimal surgical volume for individual surgeons or centers. Based on the data from the literature and a consensus opinion of experts, the ERS-ESTS guidelines advised that lung resections be performed in centers with a minimal surgical volume of 20 to 25 major anatomic resections per year. 18",

      "content": "Several criteria should be met before using assessment of lung function to predict postoperative clinical outcomes. First, the quality of the patient performance and test reproducibility must be optimal and should conform to standards. 124,125  Once performance is adequate, specifi  c attention must be directed to understanding the cause of abnormal results. For example, reduction in FEV 1 due to weakness may be associated with a different surgical outcome as compared with a patient with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), despite identical airfl  ow. In addition, the presence of an obstructing endobronchial  lesion  may  produce abnormalities on baseline testing that can be expected to improve postoperatively.  Unfortunately, there are limited data that address these and other similar issues and, therefore, the remainder of this section is specifi  cally targeted to the assessment of subjects with underlying Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nThe risk of operative complications has been linked to PPO lung function. Separate formulas are used to estimate the PPO lung function for patients undergoing pneumonectomy vs lobectomy. The PPO values can be converted into percent predicted using standard equations. For illustrative purposes, the formulas below are used for estimation of PPO FEV 1 ; the same equations can be used to estimate the PPO D lco .\nPneumonectomy: the perfusion method is used with the following formula:\nPPO FEV 1 5 preoperative FEV 1 3 (1 2 fraction of total perfusion for the resected lung)\nThe preoperative FEV 1 is taken as the best measured postbronchodilator value. A quantitative radionuclide perfusion scan is performed to measure the fraction of total perfusion for the resected lung. Standards for perfusion scan have been published by the American College of Radiology (available at http://www. acr.org/~/media/ACR/Documents/PGTS/guidelines/ Pulmonary_Scintigraphy.pdf)\nin respiratory function 3 to 6 months after lobectomy in these patients. 104-111  A most important fi  nding is that the lobar volume reduction effect takes place immediately after surgery, 112  demonstrating that the impact of operation in patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is lower than expected in patients without Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\nInterest in the diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (D lco ) as a useful marker of operative risk was stimulated by Ferguson et al, 113  who related preoperative D lco to postresection morbidity and mortality in 237 patients. Patients were selected for surgery on the  basis  of  clinical  evaluation  and  spirometry,  but not  on  the  D lco ,  which  was  also  measured.  They found the preoperative uncorrected D lco expressed as percent predicted to have a higher correlation with postoperative deaths than the FEV 1 expressed as percent predicted, or any other factor tested. In this study, a D lco , 60% predicted was associated with a 25%  mortality  and  a  40%  pulmonary  morbidity. This fi  nding was subsequently confi  rmed by other authors. 95,97,114-116   Similar to PPO FEV 1 ,  a  reduced PPO D lco has been shown to be strongly associated with the risk of pulmonary complications and mortality following lung resection. 117,118\nPrevious guidelines have recommended measuring D lco in patients with evidence of diffuse parenchymal lung disease on radiographic studies, dyspnea on exertion, or a reduced FEV 1 .  However, some contributions have shown that the correlation between FEV 1 and D lco is consistently poor 119,120  and that a reduced PPO D lco is a predictor of cardiopulmo  nary complications and mortality even in patients with an otherwise normal FEV 1 . 119,120  More than 40% of patients with an FEV 1 . 80% may have a D lco , 80%, and 7% of them may have a PPO D lco , 40%. 119  As a  consequence, guidelines have recommended the systematic measurement of D lco in  lung resection candidates regardless of the FEV 1 value. 18\nIn addition to postoperative morbidity and mortality, the value of D lco has been associated with long-term survival 121,122  and residual quality of life. 123 Liptay et al 121  showed that a D lco , 40% was associated with an increased risk of late death due to causes other than cancer. Ferguson et al 122  showed that a D lco value , 60% had a hazard ratio of 1.35 for death.\nTherefore, we recommend systematically measuring D lco in all lung resection candidates regardless of their preoperative level of FEV 1 because at least  40%  of  them  can  have  an  abnormal  D lco despite a normal FEV 1 and  PPO D lco has  been shown to be a valid predictor of major morbidity even in patients without airfl  ow limitation. Most of the studies analyzing the role of D lco in risk stratifi  cation took into consideration the uncorrected measurement of D lco . Any form of correction/adjust  ment\ndisease. In subjects with severe underlying Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and a PPO FEV 1 , 40% (mean, 34%) predicted, the survival rate was 35% after lobectomy. Although this was lower than the 65% survival observed in a comparison  group  with  superior  lung  function  (PPO FEV 1 . 40; mean, 61%), the survival was still better than expected if resection had not been performed. 128 In addition, Lau et al 129  reported favorable results in patients with severe Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) when resection was performed using video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). In this study, improvements were also noted in both hospital mortality (8% vs 14%) and long-term survival (5-year survival, 48% vs 18%) with VATS compared with thoracotomy.\nThe favorable clinical outcomes obtained in some patients with markedly abnormal lung function have multiple potential explanations. Improvements in surgical technique and introduction of VATS may be associated with benefi  cial postoperative results. Endoh et al 130 have demonstrated that postoperative fall in lung function is lower in subjects undergoing VATS compared with subjects treated with an open surgical approach. Similarly, improvement in perioperative management and tailoring of therapy to individual patients may produce benefi  ts in clinical outcome. An additional benefi  t may be obtained by performing limited resections. In a study by Linden et al, 103  analysis of frozen sections at time of surgery allowed for wedge resections in 65% of subjects. Although limited resection resulted in a favorable short-term outcome, these benefi  ts should be considered after consideration of the risk of local recurrence. Lastly, lung resection is  associated with a 'lung volume reduction' effect. 105,131-134   Patients  with  underlying  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  may demonstrate a smaller reduction in FEV 1 postoperatively than do subjects with normal spirometry. 130,131,135 In addition, an inverse relationship between postoperative decline in FEV 1 and baseline severity of airfl  ow obstruction has been demonstrated. 132-134 Lastly, patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may demonstrate improvement in postoperative FEV 1 , despite lung resection. 105,110,134\nSome advances may improve the ability of PPO lung  function  to  predict  postoperative  complications. Several studies have evaluated the use of PPO D lco specifi  cally in patients with a normal FEV 1 at baseline. 115,119,120   The rationale for these studies is based on the different components of respiratory function  assessed  by  these  tests  (lung  mechanics assessed by spirometry vs gas exchange assessed by diffusion) and the poor correlation observed between FEV 1 and D lco . 119,120  These studies identifi  ed that assessment of diffusion capacity and calculation of PPO D lco were predictive of postoperative morbidity and respiratory complications, even in the presence of normal airfl  ow. No relationship was demonstrable between mortality and PPO D lco .\nLobectomy: the anatomic method is used with the following formula:\nThe preoperative FEV 1 is taken as the best measured postbronchodilator value. The number of functional or unobstructed lung segments to be removed is y and the total number of functional segments is z . 126  The total number of segments for both lungs is 19 (10 in the right lung [three in the upper, two in the middle, fi  ve in the lower] and nine in the left lung [fi  ve in the upper and four in the lower]).\nIn a study of . 1,400  subjects undergoing lung resection, Alam et al 127  demonstrated that the OR for development of postoperative respiratory complications increases as the PPO FEV 1 and PPO D lco fall (a 10% increase in the risk of complications for every 5% decrement in PPO lung function). Accordingly, previous guidelines have recommended estimation of PPO pulmonary function for all patients with an abnormal FEV 1 ( , 80% predicted) who are being considered for surgical resection. 3  Historically, the operative risk has been considered acceptable for subjects with a PPO FEV 1 and PPO D lco . 40% predicted. For patients who do not meet these criteria, recommendations included either assessment of exercise capacity as an additional preoperative riskstratifi  cation method or consideration for alternate and/or limited therapies.\nHowever, although many data established a PPO FEV 1 of . 40% as a criterion for patients who are likely  to  do  well,  exactly  how  patients  below  this threshold will fare is less well established. Multiple observations suggest that patients who do not meet these criteria may still undergo surgery with an acceptable clinical outcome in series that include sublobar resections. Several studies have demonstrated that low values for morbidity (about 15%-25%) and mortality (about 1%-15%) can be obtained, even in subjects with  severe  reduction  in  airfl  ow;  mean  preoperative FEV 1 in  these studies ranges from 26% to 45% predicted. 103,128,129   Note that these values for preoper  ative FEV 1 were frequently below the threshold recommended for postoperative lung function, highlighting that surgery can be performed safely in selected patients with markedly abnormal lung function at baseline. The surgical techniques used in these studies varied and included limited wedge or segment resections, a combination of resection with lung volume reduction, and both open and video-assisted thoracoscopic approaches.\nLong-term survival has been analyzed in subjects with severe airfl  ow limitation undergoing surgical resection of lung tumors. Martin-Ucar et al 128  evaluated 5-year survival in patients with upper-lobe stage I\nthe expected and observed survival in subjects who did  not  undergo  surgery.  Although  the  results  of this study are encouraging, applicability to all clinical centers  would  be  limited  based  on  availability  of CPET.\nAs an alternate approach, several groups have used lower technology tests, such as the stair-climbing test. 112,133,136,137,139  Patients who were able to climb . 12 m during the stair-climbing test were offered surgery. Operative morbidity and mortality using this cutoff value during the stair-climbing test were comparable to data obtained with full CPET. Taken together, these studies suggest that curative lung resection surgery can be performed in patients with PPO lung function  as  low  as  30%  predicted,  provided  the  patient demonstrates an acceptable exercise capacity.",

      "content": "Formal CPET is a sophisticated physiologic testing  technique  that  includes  recording  the  exercise electrocardiogram, heart rate response to exercise, minute ventilation, and oxygen uptake per minute. Maximal oxygen consumption ( o 2 max) is measured from this type of exercise test and has been recommended by previous guidelines 3,17  as the next step in the preoperative risk-assessment process in those patients with compromised pulmonary function.\nBecause current equations to predict postoperative lung function are only valid 1 to 3 months after surgery, 111   attention has focused on the change in lung function observed in the immediate postoperative period. Varela et al 136  demonstrated that the best predictor of surgical morbidity and mortality was the measured FEV 1 on postoperative day 1 rather than the PPO FEV 1 . These results were extended by studies that focused on the evolution of lung function during the immediate postoperative period, when respiratory complications occur. Data demonstrate that lung function during this period is markedly lower than the corresponding PPO values.  111,133,135,136  On postoperative day 1, the FEV 1 was only 71% of the PPO  value.  135   The  FEV 1 progressively  increased through the fi  rst week and on day 7 the FEV 1 reached 93% of the PPO value.  135  Based on these results, Brunelli et al 112,137  published methods to estimate the FEV 1 on the first postoperative day and at hospital discharge.  Although  the  estimated  values  closely matched the observed data, several limitations of these studies affect their applicability at present. These studies evaluated only patients who passed a rigorous screening assessment to determine operative risk, and the relationship to clinical outcomes was not analyzed. Despite these considerations, these studies do highlight  the  limitations  associated  with  current  predictive models.\nThe  considerations  mentioned  suggest  that  the existing algorithms for preoperative pulmonary assessment can be extended to offer potentially curative surgery to patients with more severe abnormalities in lung function at baseline. Several studies have demonstrated acceptable postoperative outcome in patients with a PPO lung function as low as 30% predicted. Puente-Maest√∫ et al  138  compared acute morbidity and mortality, as well as 2-year survival, in subjects with a PPO FEV 1 and PPO D lco . 30% predicted. In this study, preoperative evaluation included estimates of PPO oxygen consumption ( o 2 ) during exercise, in addition to estimates of PPO FEV 1 and D lco . Surgery was performed in subjects with PPO lung function , 40% predicted provided that the estimated PPO oxygen consumption during exercise exceeded 10 mL/kg/min. The operative mortality was 6% despite the inclusion of subjects with severe lung function abnormalities.\nIn addition, the data demonstrated improved 2-year survival in subjects treated with surgical resection (66%) compared with subjects who either refused surgery or were deemed unfi  t for surgery (19%). Of importance,  although  survival  was  lower  in  subjects  with  the  most  abnormal  PPO  lung  function (between 30% and 40% predicted) compared with healthier subjects (survival 5 57% vs 71%), the difference was not statistically signifi  cant and far exceeded\nas a percentage of predicted value had a better discriminatory ability than when expressed in absolute values. The probability of developing complications in patients with a o 2 max . 75% predicted was only 10% vs a probability of 90% in those with o 2 max , 40% predicted. As with PPO FEV 1 and PPO D lco , a segmental estimation of o 2 max has been proposed by Bolliger and colleagues. 161  They found that a value of o 2 max PPO , 10 mL/kg/min (or 35% predicted) was the only parameter able to identify all three patients who died in a subgroup of 25 patients at increased risk of complications.\nIn addition to o 2 max, CPET can provide several other direct and indirect measures that can add to the preoperative risk stratifi  cation. Several authors have published articles about such derived parameters (ie, effi  ciency slope, oxygen pulse, minute ventilation to CO2 production ratio slope), which have turned out to  be  predictive  of  cardiac  and  pulmonary  complications. 146,162-164   A  more liberal use of CPET is warranted by its role in early detecting coronary artery disease, 63-66   the  association  between o 2 max  and postoperative complications, and the possibility to use additional ergometric parameters to refi  ne the analysis of the oxygen transport system.",

      "content": "Stair climbing has been used historically as a surrogate for CPET. Stair climbing is an economic and widely applicable form of exercise. It is simple and rapid and requires few personnel and little equipment. The stair-climbing test appears to be a more stressful form of exercise and involves a larger muscle mass than cycling, yielding greater values of o 2 max. 140,169,170 The  test  is  extremely  motivating  for  the  patients who are pushed to reach a visible objective represented by the next landing. This approach was found to  correlate  with  lung  function;  climbing  three fl  ights indicates an FEV 1 . 1.7 L and fi  ve fl  ights an FEV 1 . 2 L. 171\nSeveral groups have shown that the ability to climb more than 12-14 m of stairs, which is approximately three fl  ights of stairs, effectively identifi  es patients at low  risk  of  postoperative  complications  usually  following lobectomy, even though these patients might\nEuropean guidelines have emphasized the role of CPET in the preoperative functional workup. 18  CPET was recommended in every patient with either an FEV 1 or  a  D lco , 80%  predicted  value.  Patients with a o 2 max . 20 mL/kg/min or 75% predicted can safely undergo the planned resection (up to pneumonectomy)  without  further  testing.  Only  in  those patients with a o 2 max , 20 mL/kg/min should split lung functions (% PPO FEV 1 and % PPO D lco ) be taken into consideration for risk stratifi  cation. A o 2 max  value , 10  mL/kg/min or 35% predicted is generally regarded as a contraindication to major anatomic resections. Risk of postoperative mortality can generally be stratifi  ed by o 2 max. In several case series, patients with a o 2 max , 10 mL/kg/min had a very high  risk  of  postoperative  death. 114,140-142   However, this assumption is based on a total of only 27 patients in four studies with an overall mortality rate of 26%. A meta-analysis confi  rmed the role of o 2 max in discriminating patients at risk of postoperative cardiopulmonary complications. Benzo and colleagues  143 included  955  patients  from  14  studies  reporting o 2 max as mL/kg/min and found that those patients developing postoperative complications had a preoperative o 2 max 3 mL/kg/min lower than those who did not. The authors concluded that this fi  nding supported the use of CPET in risk stratifi  cation before lung resection.\nA  study  by  Loewen  and  colleagues 144   represents the largest published series of lung resection candidates evaluated with CPET. Complicated patients had a signifi  cantly lower o 2 max compared with noncomplicated patients, and this finding confirmed previous investigations. 37,144-148   Most of the studies published  so  far  generally  agree  that  a  value  of o 2 max  between 10 and 15 mL/kg/min or between 35% and 75% predicted values indicates an increased risk of perioperative death compared with higher values  of o 2 max.  114,141,142,149-153   On  the  other  hand, values . 20  mL/kg/min have been reported to be safe for any kind of resection, including pneumonectomy. 141,149,154-159 o 2 max has been shown to be helpful in  further  evaluating  the  risk  of  complications  in patients with borderline lung function. Morice et al, 160 for instance, reported that eight patients with a percent predicted postoperative (% PPO) FEV 1 , 33 and a o 2 max . 15 mL/kg/min underwent lobectomy with no fatal complications.\nMost recently, Brunelli and colleagues 148  published a series including 200 major anatomic lung resections with complete CPET evaluation before surgery. Patients with a o 2 max . 20 mL/kg/min had no mortality and only a 7% morbidity rate. Importantly, a value of o 2 max , 12 mL/kg/min was associated with a mortality rate of 13%. Bolliger and colleagues 151 were the fi  rst to demonstrate that o 2 max expressed\nsignifi  cantly  correlated with o 2 peak ( r 5 0.67). 157 All patients who walked . 400 m at the SWT had a o 2 peak measured at CPET . 15 mL/kg/min. On the other hand, nine of 17 patients who walked , 250 m had  a o 2 peak . 15  mL/kg/min,  indicating  that SWT tends to underestimate exercise capacity at the lower range compared with o 2 peak measured with CPET.\nIn  a  more  recent  article,  Benzo  and  Sciurba 182 found a high correlation between each level of the SWT and the oxygen consumption measured dur  ing the test. The cutoff of 25 shuttles had 90% posi  tive predictive value for predicting a o 2 peak . 15 mL/kg/min. For the 6-min walk, patients are instructed to walk as far as possible in the time allotted. Rest during the test  is  permissible.  Interpretation  of  the  distance walked in 6 min is currently not well standardized 183 and the few studies evaluating this test in lung resection  candidates  reported  confl  icting  results. 184   The European guidelines do not recommend using this test for the functional evaluation of patients considered for lung surgery  . 18",

In a group of patients with a PPO FEV 1 , 40% or PPO D lco , 40% or both, no death was observed among those climbing . 22 m, whereas the mortality was 20% among such patients unable to climb 12 m.\nA high correlation was found between altitude climbed  and o 2 peak  measured  during  the  test ( r 5 0.7). 174  The cutoff of 22 m had a positive predictive value of 86% to predict a o 2 peak of 15 mL/kg/min. However, there are limitations to the usefulness of stair climbing. It has not been performed in a standardized  manner.  The  duration  of  stair  climbing, speed of ascent, number of steps per fl  ight, height of each step, and criteria for stopping the test have varied from study to study. In an attempt to provide a method of standardization, Koegelenberg and colleagues 175  proposed using the speed of ascent, in addition to altitude; however, others have not found this parameter predictive of complications 176  Patients with comorbid conditions (eg, musculoskeletal disease, neurologic abnormalities, peripheral vascular insuffi  ciency, and others) may be unable to perform the test. Brunelli and colleagues 177,178  found that patients unable to perform stair climbing because of comorbid conditions had a fourfold higher risk of postoperative mortality compared with those able to perform the test (16% vs 4%). Other surrogate tests for CPET are the shuttle walk test (SWT) and the 6-min walk, but data on the value of these tests in predicting o 2 max are limited. 179   The SWT requires that patients walk back and forth between two markers set 10 m apart. The walking speed is paced by an audio signal and the walking speed is increased each minute in a graded fashion. The end of the test occurs when the patient is too breathless to maintain the required speed. In one study, inability to complete 25 shuttles on two occasions  suggested  a o 2 max , 10  mL/kg/min 180 ; however, other investigations were not able to fi  nd an association between shuttle walk distance and postoperative complications. 181  Nevertheless, SWT distance",

Patients should be submitted to  a  preliminary  cardiac  evaluation  (  Fig  1  ).  If  the patient is deemed to be at increased cardiac risk, he or she should be managed according to American Heart  Association/American  College  of  Cardiology guidelines and further reevaluated. If the patient's cardiac evaluation turns out negative, or positive with low risk, he or she can proceed to pulmonary function evaluation and calculation of PPO pulmonary functions. The FEV 1 and D lco should be measured in  all  patients  and  PPO  values  calculated.  Patients with both a PPO FEV 1 and a PPO D lco . 60% are regarded as at  low  risk  for  surgery.  Patients  with either a PPO FEV 1 or  a  PPO D lco between 30% and 60% should perform a low technology exercise test as a screening test. If the performance at the low technology  exercise  test  is  satisfactory,  patients  are regarded as at moderate risk. A CPET is indicated if\ncomorbid  conditions,  identifi  ed  by  the  Charlson comorbidity  index,  were  also  more  likely  to  have major complications following lung cancer resection. Melendez and colleagues  190  used regression analysis to  develop  the  predictive  respiratory  complication quotient, which is based on the % PPO FEV 1 ,  % PPO D lco , and oxygenation. This score was also effective in identifying patients at increased risk of perioperative complications. Brunelli et al 191   adapted the physiologic and operative severity score for the enumeration of mortality and morbidity, a score originally used for general surgery issues, to evaluate post-lung resection  problems.  They  suggested  that  this  score might be a useful method for comparing the complication  rates  among  different  institutions.  Ferguson and Durkin  192  developed a simple score based on the FEV 1 , D lco , and age of the patient, which seems to compare  favorably  with  other  scoring  systems 158,191 and is easy to administer. Data from national or international organizations were used to develop more reliable risk models. The ESTS proposed a model for  in-hospital  mortality  (ESOS)  incorporating  two factors, age and PPO FEV 1 . 193  Similarly, the STS generated a risk model for predicting mortality and major morbidity. 156  Finally, the French Society of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery published the Thoracoscore, a multifactorial index to predict mortality following thoracic surgery. 194  Although useful for risk stratifi  cation and benchmarking in specifi  c groups of patients, scoring systems generally lack adequate accuracy for assigning specifi  c risk to individual patients.

      "content": "A signifi  cant limitation to addressing the potential disabling long-term effects of lung resections is that studies providing objective measures such as pulmonary function tests or exercise capacity typically do not go beyond 6 months. Therefore, any disabling sequelae beyond this period truly remain understudied. With this limitation in mind, some general observations may be made. Following lung resection, lung function  will  decrease  initially.  Following  thoracotomy, FEV 1 appears to nadir immediately after surgery. 133,135,136  Early investigators in this fi  eld suggested that a postoperative FEV 1 , 0.8 L was prohibitive to resection, given the unacceptable incidence of  hypercapnia  and  pulmonary  disability. 202 Ultimately though, the factors that contribute to longterm pulmonary disability, either individually or in concert, remain largely unknown. This makes predicting who exactly will suffer long-term pulmonary disability following lobectomy or pneumonectomy largely speculative. Some data exist regarding compromised pulmonary function following either a lobectomy or a pneumonectomy, but extrapolating these data to true long-term pulmonary disability is not possible with the existing data.\nFor a lobectomy, by 6 months postoperatively, the FEV 1 recovers partially so that there is a defi  cit from the preoperative FEV 1 of between 9% and 11%. In a  prospective study, Brunelli and associates 105   demonstrated that recovery of preoperative FEV 1 and D lco to the levels described in the previous reports at  6  months  is  achievable  by  3  months  following lobectomy. Exercise capacity as measured by o 2 max will  also  decrease  following  lung  resection,  and  for lobectomy this decrease has been observed to be between 0% and 13%.  203,204  The most common limiting symptom in postoperative exercise studies has been leg discomfort, rather than dyspnea. 204,205   Bolliger et al 204  found that exercise was limited by leg muscle fatigue in 53% of patients preoperatively, and this observation remained following lobectomy.\nFor pneumonectomy, the FEV 1 recovery at 6 months is  markedly  less  and  ranges  between  34%  and 41%.  203,204,206  In a prospective study by Brunelli et al, 105 the recovery of the defi  cit in FEV 1 was 66% of the preoperative value, whereas the D lco recovery was 80% of baseline. This discrepant observation from their patients undergoing lobectomy may have been secondary to a relatively small percent  age of patients undergoing pneumonectomy being included in their\nIn terms of mid-term and long-term survival, encouraging results have been observed among patients undergoing LVRS and lung cancer resections. 215,218,224 One prospective case-control study found that patients with  heterogeneous  upper-lobe  emphysema  who underwent upper lobectomy for known stage I and II lung cancer had a respectable, but lower overall, survival compared with those patients undergoing conventional LVRS resections (57 months vs 88 months, P 5 .06). 218  In contrast, Nakajima et al 226  reported that patients with severe Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) undergoing curative-intent resections for their lung cancers had a worse 5-year survival (24% vs 59%, P , .0001)  relative  to  their patients  undergoing  more  straightforward  LVRS. However, this study was skewed in that preoperative baseline difference in smoking status, pulmonary function  tests,  and  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  grade  existed  favoring  the LVRS population. Although indications for combined LVRS and lung cancer resection are still evolving, the most promising candidates appear to be patients who have a cancer in the upper lobe that is also affected by emphysema and who would otherwise meet the criteria  for  LVRS  (ie,  D lco and  FEV 1 . 20%  predicted).Although some have suggested a more aggressive  approach, 227   enthusiasm  for  recruiting  patients with relatively preserved lung should be tempered by the fact that conclusions regarding the differences in long-term outcomes between LVRS alone and LVRS with patients with lung cancer may have compared different populations at baseline.",

There is, however, a growing body of evidence that suggests that preoperative conditioning may be advantageous.  236-238  In the National Emphysema Treatment Trial, all patients underwent pulmonary rehabilitation prior to randomization to either medical treatment or LVRS. Pulmonary rehabilitation provided important benefi  ts in dyspnea, quality of life, and exercise ability. 236 Weinstein et al 237   demonstrated that a preoperative regimen was inversely proportional to patients' length of stay. Bobbio et al 238  demonstrated that their preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation program resulted in an increase in o 2 max at the anaerobic threshold and that there was an increase in workload. Other data, however, are not as supportive, showing that cardiopulmonary performance is not signifi  cantly altered. 239 Ultimately, the absence of randomized controlled trial data regarding preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation allows for only the suggestion that it will be benefi  cial to the patients undergoing it. In the postoperative  setting,  information  is  emerging  that initiating an inpatient regimen following a lung resection  is  immediately  benefi  cial  for  patients.  These inpatient programs have been associated with improvements in exercise performance, symptoms, and pulmonary function tests (FEV 1 ). 240,241  Secondary gains, in the form of improved quadriceps strength, without improvements in objective exercise performance mea  sures, have been found to occur with pulmonary rehabilitation programs. 242  Improvements in exercise performance without any objective improvements in pulmonary function tests have also been observed with postoperative pulmonary rehabilitation. 243  Even in the absence of a formalized rehabilitation program\n14  .
