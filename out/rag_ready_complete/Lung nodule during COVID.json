There are multiple local, regional, and patient-related factors that should be considered when applying these statements to individual patient care.\nCHEST 2020; 158(1):406-415\nKEY WORDS: consensus statement; COVID-19; lung cancer screening; lung nodule\nIn some parts of the world, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has stressed the healthcare systems close to or even past their breaking point. Rightfully, much of the attention to date has focused on the immediate needs of patients suffering from the disease, particularly those who are critically\nill. The strain on health-care systems and the need to control the virus using containment (testing and isolating cases) and mitigation (social distancing and shelter-in-place orders) have affected the care of patients with other common medical disorders. Clinicians have been forced to balance the risk of delaying potentially necessary evaluation and management against the risks of exposing patients to the virus in hospital settings, or exposing health-care workers to patients who may be asymptomatic carriers of the disease. This situation is further complicated by the re-allocation of resources, including personnel, to appropriately evaluate and treat patients with COVID-19.\nTwo related clinical situations that bring these issues into sharp focus are lung cancer screening and the evaluation and management of incidentally detected lung nodules. Current guidelines for lung cancer screening from CHEST (the American College of Chest Physicians), the United States Preventive Services Taskforce, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommend annual low-dose chest CT screening for high-risk individuals, where the bene /uniFB01 t of screening is believed to outweigh the harms. 1-3 Similarly, CHEST, the Fleischner Society, the British Thoracic Society, and the American College of Radiology have published guidelines with recommendations that balance the bene /uniFB01 t and harms of evaluating incidental and screen-detected lung nodules. 4-7 The recommendations for small nodules are based on the size and attenuation characteristics of the nodule as well as the presence of lung cancer risk factors, whereas those for larger nodules are based on the estimated probability of malignancy (pCA) and the yield of additional testing. 4,6\nClinical prediction models have been developed and validated to assess the pCA in nodules. These models can be used to help guide decisions about the selection and interpretation of additional diagnostic testing. 8-11 Management decisions generally fall into three categories based on the estimated pCA of the nodule. For those in whom the pCA is low (de /uniFB01 ned as < 5%15% in different guidelines), 4-7 surveillance imaging is\nand Critical Care Medicine (Dr Arenberg) and Department of Radiology (Dr Kazerooni), University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (Dr Chen), Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO; Section of Thoracic Surgery (Dr Detterbeck), Department of Surgery, Yale University, New Haven, CT; Department of Surgery (Dr Farjah), University of Washington, Seattle, WA; Department of Thoracic Medicine (Dr Fong), The Prince Charles Hospital, Chermside, Australia; The Pulmonary Center (Dr Iaccarino), Boston University Medical Campus, Boston, MA; Lungs for Living Research Centre (Dr Janes), University College London, London, England; Department of Radiology (Dr Kanne), University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI; Department of Radiology (Dr MacMahon), University of Chicago, Chicago, IL; Department of Radiology (Dr Naidich), New York University-Langone Medical Center, New York, NY; Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care, and Sleep Medicine (Dr Powell), Icahn School of Medicine at Mt.

Management of lung nodules and lung cancer screening during the COVID-19 pandemic: CHEST expert panel report. Chest . 2020;158(1):406-415.\nCORRESPONDENCE TO: Peter J.

When the pCA is intermediate (de /uniFB01 ned as 5%-15% to 65%-70% in different guidelines), 4-7 functional imaging (a PET scan) and/or a nonsurgical biopsy (bronchoscopy or transthoracic needle biopsy) is recommended. When the pCA is high ( > 65%-70% in different guidelines), direct referral for surgical resection is suggested if technically feasible and the patient is otherwise /uniFB01 t. 4,6 Although these recommendations seem straightforward, factors such as patient comorbidities and patient and provider preferences often in /uniFB02 uence the management strategy. The overarching goal of management is to avoid invasive procedures in patients who have benign nodules while expeditiously treating those that are malignant.\nPerforming a screening examination, and the evaluation of lung nodules, carries an added risk during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is added risk to the patient, other patients, and health-care providers from exposure to the health-care environment and the contact that occurs during testing. Recovery from surgical resection\nmay be in /uniFB02 uenced by asymptomatic carriage of the virus. These added risks may upset the balance of bene /uniFB01 t and harm struck by current (pre-COVID-19) guideline recommendations. There is also a shift in health-care resources, toward cancelling elective procedures and imaging, in areas where COVID-19 is surging, or where systems are preparing for a surge, making it more dif /uniFB01 cult to adhere to available guidelines. These exposure risks and resource constraints have led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to suggest that nonurgent care be deferred. 12\nTo date, clinicians and hospital systems have been independently determining how to modify their screening and nodule management programs during the pandemic. The purpose of the current consensus statement was to provide expert opinion to clinicians in regards to the performance of lung cancer screening and the management of patients with pulmonary nodules (detected either incidentally or by screening) in a manner that is consistent with current CDC COVID-19 guidance.",

Changes to the wording of the scenarios, statements, and\nnotes that occurred during the second teleconference were minor, helping to clarify the content, while being careful not to fundamentally change the statements in a way that could have altered the voting from the /uniFB01 rst video teleconference. A prede /uniFB01 ned threshold of 70% of panel participants voting agree or strongly agree had to be exceeded for a consensus statement to be accepted.\nThe manuscript was then drafted by the project leaders with attention to expanding on nuances of decision-making and the factors that would in /uniFB02 uence decisions.

      "content": "The current article provides expert consensus-based statements about the care of individuals who are eligible for lung cancer screening and patients with pulmonary nodules detected either incidentally or by screening during the COVID-19 pandemic. The statements are consistent with guidance from the CDC to defer nonurgent care while health-care systems respond to the anticipated surge of COVID-19 cases and while social distancing and other mitigation measures are in place. It is important to note that the situation is /uniFB02 uid, and it is\nnot possible at this time to determine when it will be advisable to return to usual care practices. That said, we suspect that the statements will remain valid in most countries for at least the next 3 to 6 months.\nConsensus was unanimous for recommendations to delay baseline or repeat annual screening (statements 1-2), and > 95% of panelists agreed to delay the evaluation of pulmonary nodules detected incidentally or by screening that have a low probability of cancer or are likely to be an indolent cancer (statements 3-6). Such nodules include solid nodules measuring < 8 mm in average diameter, pure ground-glass opacities of any size, and part-solid nodules in which the solid component measures 6 to 8 mm in average diameter. Evaluation beyond the next surveillance scan will be in /uniFB02 uenced by the interval that had passed and the result of the surveillance scan.\nConsensus was less uniform but still strong for recommendations to delay or modify the evaluation and management of patients with nodules measuring > 8 mm in average diameter (statements 7-11) (Table 3). For such nodules with a pCA < 25%, there was consensus that evaluation could be delayed for 3 to 6 months. In contrast, most panel members agreed that evaluation with PET or nonsurgical biopsy should occur when the pCA is 25% to 85%, with subsequent referral for treatment when cancer is con /uniFB01 rmed or more strongly suspected. Presumably, this approach will reduce the frequency of avoidable surgery for patients with benign nodules compared with a strategy that follows current (pre-COVID-19) guidelines (65%70% pCA threshold to consider proceeding directly to surgery), 4,6 at a time when hospital resources are being redirected to the care of patients with COVID-19. Based on a similar line of reasoning, there was consensus that patients with a very high pCA ( > 85%) do not require additional diagnostic testing and can proceed directly to a treatment decision, thereby minimizing pretreatment procedures that may pose a risk to the patient or members of the health-care team (with the caveat that the patient should undergo appropriate staging and pretreatment physiological assessment in keeping with the principle of minimizing the use of invasive procedures and testing that generates aerosolized viral particles and that allows for judicious use of personal protective equipment).\nAlthough there was universal consensus that treatment of stage I non-small cell lung cancer could be delayed in\ncertain circumstances during the COVID-19 mitigation period, decision-making in these cases should be guided by considerations such as the degree of hypermetabolism or growth rate of the tumor, the /uniFB01 tness of the patient for curative treatment, and patient preferences. Evaluation and treatment decisions for patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer and those with nodules at intermediate or high risk of cancer (pCA > 25%) should ideally be guided by multidisciplinary input and discussion, to ensure that all factors are weighed, and that management is appropriately individualized.\nPatient preferences should be taken into account in all of the scenarios because individual patients are likely to differ in how they perceive the potential bene /uniFB01 ts and harms associated with delayed or modi /uniFB01 ed evaluation and management. This highlights the importance of communication about the rationale for decisions with these patients. Pre-COVID-19 de /uniFB01 ciencies in patient communication about lung nodule management are well documented. 13 During the COVID-19 pandemic, where more communication is occurring over virtual platforms, these challenges are likely to be magni /uniFB01 ed. It is incumbent on providers to plan for these communication challenges by developing strategies and tools for communication of lung cancer risk and nodule management on these platforms.\nAs much as possible, patient management should be based on evidence and re /uniFB02 ect a balance of bene /uniFB01 ts and harms of particular management approaches. Although many aspects of these scenarios have been reasonably de /uniFB01 ned in pre-COVID-19 settings, the COVID-19 pandemic introduces additional risks. The magnitude of these risks is not well de /uniFB01 ned and is likely variable depending on the local situation. The voting re /uniFB02 ects con /uniFB01 dence among the expert panel that suf /uniFB01 cient evidence exists that the risk of a delay in screening, in surveillance imaging, in avoidance of biopsy procedures, or delaying management of an early cancer in the 12 scenarios is low, and an estimate that the risks related to COVID-19 posed by proceeding with pre-COVID-19 recommendations are probably higher during the active phase of the pandemic. Given the limited information available to clinicians, we encourage providers and patients to consider guidance from this document and those of other professional societies. 14\nThe authors of this consensus statement recognize that our statements should not be interpreted as\none-size/uniFB01 ts-all and that what is appropriate now will change over time. Application of a general assessment to an individual patient requires the clinical judgment of the management team. In addition to considering patient factors and values, we have attempted to highlight that local factors, such as the prevalence of COVID-19 in the community, the availability of rapid COVID-19 testing, the adequacy of resources (personnel, imaging equipment, personal protective equipment), local policies, and the presence of other care delivery sites that are less affected by COVID, should be considered when making individual decisions.\nWe hope these statements are helpful and provide some reassurance and direction to individuals who are eligible for lung cancer screening, patients with lung nodules, and the clinicians who are caring for them during this challenging time.",
