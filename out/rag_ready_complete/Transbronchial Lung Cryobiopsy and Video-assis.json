DPLDs differ widely in their etiology, clinicopathologic features, therapeutic options, and prognosis (1). International\nconsensus guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) (2, 3) indicate that in approximately 50% of cases, chest highresolution computed tomography may not be suf /uniFB01 cient to diagnose idiopathic pulmonary /uniFB01 brosis (IPF), and surgical lung biopsy is recommended to\ndistinguish usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) from other ILDs (4). Although transbronchial lung forceps biopsy is not currently recommended to histologically con /uniFB01 rm UIP, due to its low diagnostic yield (2, 5), surgical lung biopsy, whether video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) or open-lung biopsy (OLB), is\nburdened by its associated risks, postoperative complications, and prolonged hospitalization.\nTransbronchial lung cryobiopsy is increasingly being used for the assessment of DPLDs. The major advantage of this procedure is that larger tissue samples with a higher percentage of alveolar tissue can be obtained with fewer crush artifacts and less atelectasis (6 -8). The cryosurgical equipment operates by the Joule -Thompson effect (9), which dictates that a compressed gas released at high /uniFB02 ow rapidly expands and creates a very low temperature. The cooling agent (carbon dioxide or nitrous oxide) is applied under high pressure through the central canal of the probe. The gas at the tip suddenly expands due to difference in pressure (relative to atmospheric pressure), causing a drop in temperature at the tip of the probe (in the tissue of approximately 2 50 8 C to 2 60 8 C). The probe is cooled for approximately 3 to 6 seconds (larger probe cooled for 7 -8 s). The frozen tissue attached to the probe ' s tip is removed by pulling the cryoprobe together with the bronchoscope. The frozen specimen is then thawed in physiological saline and /uniFB01 xed in formalin.\nSeveral meta-analyses (5, 10 -12) have evaluated the diagnostic yield and safety of transbronchial lung cryobiopsy. The pooled diagnostic yield in the metaanalyses by Sharp and colleagues (5), Johannson and colleagues (11), and Ravaglia and colleagues (12) was reported to be 84% (75.9 -91.4% on the basis of 11 studies and abstracts), 83% (73 -94% on the basis of 11 studies), and 81% (75 -87% on the basis of 12 studies and abstracts), respectively. The meta-analysis by Ganganah and colleagues (10) on the basis of two studies reported an 85% diagnostic yield. Although the pooled incidence of post-procedure pneumothorax reported in these meta-analyses (5, 10 -12) was similar (6 -12%), the incidence of moderate to severe bleeding differed widely (12 -39%). In this ' diagnostic test accuracy ' metaanalysis, we sought to not only update the pooled diagnostic yield from all published studies in the literature but also report on other diagnostic test accuracy measures (pooled sensitivity, speci /uniFB01 city, diagnostic odds ratio, and summary receiver operative curve [SROC]) as well as the safety pro /uniFB01 le of transbronchial lung\ncryobiopsy and compare these with studies on VATS.",

      "content": "With a 4.9% (2.2 -10.7%) incidence of grade 2 endobronchial bleeding and 9.5% (5.9 -14.9%) incidence of pneumothorax after transbronchial lung cryobiopsy (Figures 8 and 9), 0.7% 30- to 60-day mortality post lung cryobiopsy compared with 1.8% with VATS (Figure 11), reported median hospitalization time of 2.6 days compared with the 6.1 days with VATS ( P , 0.0001), and diagnostic test accuracy approaching that of VATS, transbronchial lung cryobiopsy should be considered an alternative to surgical lung biopsy (OLB or VATS) or attempted /uniFB01 rst in patients with DPLDs, elderly patients, and those with signi /uniFB01 cant comorbidities. The incidence of post-procedure pneumothorax in our metaanalysis is higher than that reported for the conventional transbronchial forceps biopsy (6% [3.2 -9.6%]) (5).\nHowever, the increased diagnostic yield (84% with transbronchial lung cryobiopsy vs. 64% with conventional forceps biopsy) and the increased sample size provided by transbronchial lung cryobiopsy need to be considered in clinical practice. The diagnostic yield of 84% with transbronchial lung cryobiopsy is comparatively less than the 92.7% diagnostic yield with VATS, as shown in our meta-analysis. With a sensitivity of 87% and speci /uniFB01 city of 57%, transbronchial\nDiagnostic Odds ratio (OR) (95% CI)\nlung cryobiopsy lags somewhat behind VATS, which has a relatively higher sensitivity and speci /uniFB01 city (91% and 58%, respectively). Variable diagnostic yield with transbronchial lung cryobiopsy in different studies could partially be explained by the size of the cryoprobes:\n70 to 95% with a 2.4-mm probe (6, 8, 14, 15, 18, 21) and 79 to 80% with a 1.9-mm probe (17, 19, 20).\nFurthermore, optimal tissue yield can also be affected by several factors: number of biopsies, short versus long freeze time, operating room versus bronchoscopy area,\nmethod of sedation (moderate sedation vs. a deeply sedated patient), method of bronchoscopy ( /uniFB02 exible vs. rigid), and measures to treat complications such as hemoptysis (prophylactically using Fogarty balloon). The use of general anesthesia could theoretically reduce the risk of iatrogenic complications (less patient movement and coughing) and improve tissue yield. However, transbronchial lung cryobiopsy under moderate sedation (with preservation of spontaneous breathing) has been shown to perform just as well, with a lower risk of iatrogenic pneumothorax than transbronchial lung cryobiopsy under general anesthesia (18). Although an increased number of cryoprobe biopsies would theoretically improve the diagnostic yield, it could also lead to more bleeding and pneumothorax complications (18). Typically, two to four biopsies are considered suf /uniFB01 cient for pathological examination. Our meta-analysis also shows a trend for 2.4-mm size cryoprobe to be associated with signi /uniFB01 cant pneumothorax rate (12, 18, 23, 25). Although the use of /uniFB02 exible versus rigid bronchoscopy and choice of moderate versus deep sedation are dependent on the comfort level of the bronchoscopist, we recommend, at the very least, to have a bronchial blocker in place and the\nDefinition of abbreviation : N/A = data not available.\nbronchoscopy room equipped with ultrasound and emergency chest tube equipment, to be prepared for any potential immediate complications post procedure.\nAlthough baseline FVC affects the suitability of the candidate for surgical lung biopsy and predicts the risk of adverse events postsurgery (40, 41), complications\nafter transbronchial lung cryobiopsy seem to occur independent of lung function values (12). Median time of hospitalization after surgical lung biopsy for any cause is between 4 and 8 days, elderly patients being at higher risk for prolonged hospitalization (42, 43). Prolonged hospitalization along with operating room time, anesthesia time, and professional\ncharges of different disciplinary teams increase the associated costs with VATS or any surgical lung biopsy. According to a recent cost-effective analysis conducted in Spain by Hern´ andez-Gonz´ alez and colleagues (19), cryobiopsies have the potential to save about € 31,451.97 ( € 953.09/patient) for outpatient surgical lung biopsy\nFigure 8. Endobronchial bleeding with transbronchial lung cryobiopsy. The size of the circle indicates the weight of the effect size as determined by the number of studies and participants. The diamond indicates the pooled effect. CI = confidence interval.\nprocedures and € 59,846.29 ( € 1925.29/ patient) for surgical lung biopsies requiring hospitalization. Similarly, on the basis of a theoretical cost analysis, Sharp and colleagues (5) report that transbronchial lung cryobiopsy has the potential to save £210 per patient in the /uniFB01 rst year and £647 in subsequent years.\nThe yield of lung parenchyma resulting in clinically useful histopathological\ndiagnoses from conventional transbronchial biopsy specimens is on the order of 38% (44), and the yield of nonspeci /uniFB01 c in /uniFB02 ammation and /uniFB01 brosis varies from 21 to 48% (45). Thus, conventional transbronchial biopsy does not compare well with transbronchial lung cryobiopsy, which has a speci /uniFB01 city of 57% for DPLDs. In a cross-sectional study of 117 patients with UIP on high-resolution computed tomography, where half of the patients\nunderwent either transbronchial lung cryobiopsy or surgical lung biopsy, Tomassetti and colleagues (25) observed that the proportion of IPF cases diagnosed with a high degree of con /uniFB01 dence increased from 16 to 63% after adding cryobiopsy in the process. Pathologists experienced in cryobiopsy analysis had an agreement nearly equivalent to surgical lung biopsy (0.73 for cryobiopsy vs. 0.86 for surgical lung biopsy), and the diagnoses obtained by multidisciplinary team discussion were similarly distributed in the two groups (transbronchial lung cryobiopsy and surgical lung biopsy) (25). The current gold standard for the diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases, when surgical lung biopsy is incorporated into a multidisciplinary discussion, is limited by modest interobserver agreement by expert pathologists: ' moderate to good ' agreement for those interpreting ILD patterns, ' good ' agreement for IPF and connective tissue disease -related ILD, ' moderate ' agreement for nonspeci /uniFB01 c interstitial pneumonia, and ' fair ' agreement for hypersensitivity pneumonitis (46).\nOur meta-analysis con /uniFB01 rms the results of prior meta-analyses (5, 10 -12) that reported a pooled diagnostic yield of 81 to 85% for transbronchial lung cryobiopsy and 91 to 98% for VATS. However, there are important differences between ours and prior meta-analyses (5, 10 -12). Unlike our meta-analysis, none of the prior meta-analyses (5, 10 -12) analyzed other measures of diagnostic test accuracy (pooled sensitivity, speci /uniFB01 city, diagnostic odds ratio, and SROC). Our meta-analysis excluded data from abstracts and conference proceedings, which were included in the pooled analyses by others (5, 12). Although the pooled incidence of post-procedural pneumothorax in our study (9.5% [5.9 -14.9%]) is similar to what has been previously reported, that of\nmoderate to severe bleeding differs greatly from a few (5, 10, 11). On the latter, our results are in contrast, probably because ours is a pooled data set from 16 studies, whereas, for example, Johannson and colleagues ' (11) is from 4 studies, Sharp and colleagues ' (5) is from 11 studies (including an abstract), Ravaglia and colleagues ' (12) is from 12 studies (including abstracts), and Ganganah and colleagues ' (10) is only from 3 studies.",

      "content": "Our meta-analysis has a few limitations. We did not construct funnel plots for assessing publication bias. This was decided a priori on the basis of the evidence that the unique features of a meta-analysis of diagnostic test accuracy\ndo not allow for the application of Begg, Egger, and Macaskill tests of funnel plot asymmetry and can be potentially misleading (47, 48). Estimates of sensitivity and diagnostic yield showed high heterogeneity, and the design of this meta-analysis limited us in exploring potential sources of heterogeneity. Heterogeneity can be explained by technical/procedural differences between bronchoscopists and selection bias in studies. Moreover, the reported endobronchial bleeding could have been underreported in different studies.",

      "content": "In conclusion, our meta-analysis demonstrates that in the evaluation of DPLDs, the diagnostic performance of\ntransbronchial lung cryobiopsy is comparable to that of VATS. However, the risk of potential procedural complications, such as pneumothorax and moderate to severe bleeding, need to be weighed in when\nconsidering this procedure. Further research with head-to-head comparisons of transbronchial lung cryobiopsy and VATS or OLB, the current gold standard for surgically obtained lung tissue, is warranted to compare\nthe diagnostic accuracy of both procedures in the evaluation of DPLD. n\nAuthor disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org.",
