      "content": "Tracheostomy is the most common procedure performed on the airway in patients in ICUs. The first attempt was registered on Egyptian papyrus in 3,100 BC; the procedure evolved in the centuries that followed to open tracheostomy. 1 The open tracheostomy procedure was standard-\nized by Jackson in 1909 1 and underwent minor changes during the 20th century. In 1985, Ciaglia et al 2 described a modification of open tracheostomy and introduced the Seldinger principle for the antegrade percutaneous approach. The first percutaneous tracheostomy system employed multiple, sequentially larger dilators. However, in 1999, Ciaglia modified his original procedure to the single progressive dilator method known today as Blue Rhino. 3 Other methods of antegrade percutaneous tracheostomy were reported by Griggs et al 4 in 1990 using a one-step dilation of the tracheostoma with rounded-tip forceps, by Frova and Quintel 5 in 2002 using stomal dilation with a unique screw-like dilating device (PercuTwist), and by Zgoda and Berger 6 in 2005 and Cianchi et al 7 in 2010 using a modification of the Blue Rhino device that employed balloon dilation. A retrograde tracheostomy technique called the translaryngeal method was described by Fantoni and Ripamonti 8 in 1997.\nAll methods of percutaneous tracheostomy use a modification of the Seldinger technique, which involves punc-\nDr Sanabria has disclosed no conflicts of interest.\nCorrespondence: Alvaro Sanabria MD MSc PhD, Oncology Unit, Hospital Pablo Tobon Uribe, Calle 78B No. 69-240, Medell√≠n, Colombia.

The trocar is then withdrawn, and dilators are serially passed over the guidewire, which directs the tip of the dilators into the tracheal lumen. There are some variations in the method of performing and dilating the tracheal stoma; some have theoretical advantages, including providing direct vision when performing the dilation, simplicity, and safety. Nonetheless, there is disagreement about which of these methods is the best in terms of effectiveness and safety, and the choice is often determined by subjective factors, experience, economic issues, and availability. To date, there is only one systematic review that addresses this question. In 2012, Cabrini et al 9 analyzed 13 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and suggested that the Blue Rhino method was safer and more effective, and suggested that the translaryngeal method be discarded because of its high number of complications. However, the meta-analysis involved highly heterogeneous evidence and made the assumption that the studies supported equivalence between the methods.\nTraditionally, percutaneous tracheostomy has been a subject of interest to both intensive care and anesthesia specialists, but in recent years, it has been used by general surgeons, head and neck surgeons, and otolaryngologists. The subject becomes more critical when percutaneous tracheostomy is used with more complicated patients and when complications need to be managed by these specialists. The aim of this study was to assess the different methods of percutaneous tracheostomy used for ICU patients in terms of successful performance of the tracheostomy, as well as safety relating to outcomes such as bleeding, tracheal tears, false tracts, and performance difficulty.",

      "content": "A search was conducted on the MEDLINE, LILACS, Embase, and Cochrane Collaboration databases for RCTs published between January 1985 and November 2013 using the terms tracheostomy, tracheotomy, clinical trial, and percutaneous. An expanded search of each relevant article was performed using Boolean operators. References were explored to identify other articles. Only studies published in the English language were included (Fig. 1).\nFollowing a preliminary search, I reviewed all abstracts; those that dealt with percutaneous tracheostomy methods were selected for further analysis. Inclusion criteria for studies were RCTs of adult ICU subjects who underwent elective tracheostomy. Exclusion criteria were contraindications to percutaneous tracheostomy such as local infection, bleeding disorders, malignant cervical tumors, and spinal trauma. The Ciaglia multiple dilator, Ciaglia Blue Rhino, Ciaglia balloon dilator, Griggs, Fantoni, and PercuTwist methods were analyzed. The main outcome measures were complications and difficulty/impossibility\nto perform the procedure. Other outcomes such as hypoxemia or hypotension during the procedure reported by each study were recorded but were not considered in the final analysis. Complications were classified into major (bleeding requiring any intervention, defined as major by the original authors, or posterior tracheal tears) and minor (limited bleeding). Outcome follow-up had to be until death or the ICU discharge date. Difficulty was classified subjectively by most authors; for the purpose of this study, a negative outcome was classified as a highly difficult or impossible tracheostomy procedure and having to change the method of tracheostomy.\nData were collected regarding sample size, subject characteristics, surgical procedures, and outcomes. The methodological quality of each study was assessed in accordance with Cochrane Collaboration guidelines for RCTs (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other bias) giving a qualification of risk of bias. Methodological and clinical weaknesses are discussed.\nData from each study were extracted for calculation of risk differences using a 2 √ó 2 table. Statistical analysis was performed with Stata 9.0 software (StataCorp, College Station, Texas), and risk difference (95% CI) was calculated for each outcome using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed effects model when heterogeneity allowed (Higgins I 2 < 50%). Sensitivity analysis adjusting for quality and subgroup analysis by type of method (antegrade vs retrograde) and dilation technique were also planned. Heterogeneity was assessed with the Q test (significant if P < .05), and the influence of heterogeneity on the odds ratio was determined with the I 2 test. If clinical and methodological",

      "content": "Tracheostomy has a long history in surgery. Excellent reviews about this subject show that the procedure was common and had good results even in ancient Egypt. 1,25 The procedure remained unchanged for > 20 centuries. In the middle of the 20th century, Shelden et al 26 modified and described the first attempt of a less invasive tracheostomy, but it was not successful. Later in 1985, Pasquale Ciaglia, a thoracic surgeon in Utica, New York, first described 26 patients treated with a technique of percutaneous dilational tracheostomy based on the Seldinger principle, using a nephrostomy kit. 2 In 1990, William M Griggs, an intensivist from Adelaide, Australia, described his method using guidewire dilating forceps, which were adapted Kelly clamps that allowed the passage of the wire to guide tracheal dilation. 4 In 1995, Antonio Fantoni, from the anesthesia group at the San Carlo Borromeo Hospital in Milan, Italy, described the method of translaryngeal tracheostomy using the previously described procedure of Ciaglia, but in a retrograde fashion. 8 In 2002, Giulio Frova, from the anesthesia department of the Civil Hospital in Brescia, Italy, described the method using a screw-like dilator. 5 In 2005, Michael A Zgoda, 6 from the pulmonary department at the University of Kentucky, described balloon dilation used with the Ciaglia Blue Rhino method.\nAll these techniques were designed with the specific objective of making a small incision with consequently less wound complications, simplifying the procedure so that it could be done at the bedside without an anesthesiologist or intubation while avoiding moving the patient to the operating room. However, some methods offer advantages over the others. For example, with the Griggs method, insertion is under direct vision and with only one dilation compared with the Ciaglia multiple dilator technique. The Fantoni method guarantees that the tube is intratracheal, and the Frova method tries to decrease the risk of cartilage fracture.\nAlthough there is clear evidence of clinical equivalence between open and percutaneous tracheostomies, 27-30 there is not enough information to conclude which of the percutaneous tracheostomy techniques is the best in terms of insertion success and complication rates.\nIn this review, 14 RCTs comparing different methods of percutaneous tracheostomy were found. The main features of each study are shown in Table 1. Most studies, except\nthat by Karvandian et al, 14 are classified as low bias risk according to the Cochrane Collaboration criteria (see Table 2). Two studies compared the original Ciaglia technique with its modern version, the Ciaglia Blue Rhino method. The risk of tracheal ring fracture was the only statistically significant outcome that was higher in the Blue Rhino method. It was not possible to find a statistical difference in the other outcomes, but for most of the outcomes of these comparisons, only data from one study could be used. Only one study compared the Blue Rhino and Blue Dolphin methods, with more statistically significant events of minor bleeding and more subjective difficulty in the latter without differences in other outcomes. It was not possible to find information about the total number of complications. Comparison between the Blue Rhino and Griggs methods revealed a statistically significant difference in subjective tracheal ring fracture, minor bleeding, difficulty, and overdilation with the Griggs method, without differences in other outcomes. Comparisons between the original Ciaglia and PercuTwist methods and between the Ciaglia, Griggs, and PercuTwist methods did not indicate a statistically significant difference in any outcomes. Comparison between the Blue Rhino and PercuTwist showed that only difficulty was statistically different (higher for PercuTwist), but Birbicer et al 24 did not report tracheal ring fractures, and Byhahn et al 22 did not report pneumothorax incidences.\nIn the comparison between the original Ciaglia and Griggs methods, no statistically significant difference were found in any outcome, with only a minor trend for major bleeding with the Griggs method. However, not all outcomes were reported by the trials, so many comparisons were made with data from only one or 2 trials. Comparison between the Griggs and Fantoni methods showed higher difficulty with the Fantoni method, without differences in other outcomes, whereas comparison between the Griggs\nand PercuTwist methods showed no differences in any outcomes.\nAs is evident from the above, comparisons between individual methods did not offer data to determine which method is superior because of the low number of trials, the incomplete number of events in some comparisons, and the small sample sizes in others. Therefore, a comparison was made between the Blue Rhino method and the other methods combined based on the availability and wide use of the Blue Rhino method. A lower subjective difficulty and more minor bleeding with the Blue Rhino method were found (Fig. 2), but with an important statistical heterogeneity as defined by the Higgins I 2 , which suggests that the pooled results are not conclusive. There was no higher major bleeding with the Blue Rhino method (Fig. 3). The other outcomes were not different, but had the same problems as with the individual analyses. A finding that was clear in all studies is a shorter time with the simple dilator method. However, time differences of a few minutes probably do not have a clinical impact on patients.\nWhen new devices are designed and introduced in clinical practice, it is obligatory to assess their effectiveness and safety. Some devices are totally different from existing ones, and the way to assess effectiveness is through RCTs under a superiority hypothesis. 31,32 However, most devices introduce only minor improvements compared with existing products; in such cases, the way to assess effectiveness and safety is in trials based on equivalence or non-inferiority hypotheses. 31-33 This applies to percutaneous tracheostomy methods. After Ciaglia's design based on the Seldinger principle, the newer methods introduced only small changes designed to increase simplicity, speed, or safety of the previous methods. The equivalence trials are highly exigent due to the large sample size necessary to probe the hypothesis. In recent years, the appearance of the non-inferiority trial has offered a novel method that\npartially resolves the problem of huge sample sizes. If we want to test the equivalence of different percutaneous tracheostomy methods based on the low number of serious complications or rates of difficulty, ‚àº 0-6% 34 and a tolerable clinical difference of 2%, it will be necessary to collect > 6,500 patients. However, if a non-inferiority hypothesis is chosen, the sample size will probably decrease to 1,500 patients. This information helps one to understand the challenge of assessing the methods of percutaneous tracheostomy. Although 14 randomized trials were found, different methods were evaluated with different control groups and small sample sizes, making it difficult to support an equivalence hypothesis. Moreover, none of the studies included considered the non-inferiority hypothesis, so it is hard to determine that one method is not inferior to another. The methodological evaluation of the trials showed that although they complied with most of the Cochrane criteria to assess bias, the design and small sample size preclude reaching a clinically relevant conclusion. The problem of lack of power has been a constant in clinical research, and trials designed without a large enough sample size have even been considered unethical by some authors. 35 In 2012, Cabrini et al 9 tried to solve this problem with a meta-analysis. However, I differ from their approach. I excluded one of the trials they included, 15 so data about events and number of total complications were different from this study. Although Cabrini et al 9 found a high statistical heterogeneity, they accepted the pooled result, which is not recommended by meta-analysis experts. 36-38\nMost authors in the individual studies and in the only existing meta-analysis suggested that treatments are equivalent, but the type-2 error precludes support for this conclusion, so it is not possible to determine whether one of the percutaneous method is better than another.\nAnother problem with the studies that were evaluated is the heterogeneity in defining outcomes. Complications were defined differently in the studies. For some authors, bleeding was major when requiring any form of intervention, but others defined it by quantity. Outcomes reported were also heterogeneous. Some reported all complications, but others reported only some, which decreases the number of eligible subjects to be included in a meta-analysis. The subjective aspect of surgical difficulty in introduction of a guidewire or dilation of the trachea was also a problem because the definition of these outcomes was difficult to standardize. Thus, it is probable that pooled results do not reflect reality about outcomes.",

      "content": "There are different methods of percutaneous tracheostomy, but it is impossible to determine which is better. I can only suggest that the Blue Rhino method is less difficult and probably has more minor bleeding events, but physicians also have more experience with this technique, so it is preferred over other methods. However, selection of each method must be made based on clinical criteria, experience, and availability. A larger RCT must be designed to compare the most common Blue Rhino method with the others based on previous calculation of sample size and a standard definition of important outcomes that allow this problem to be solved. It is also important to realize that percutaneous tracheostomy has been tested only in low-risk patients. Therefore, open tracheostomy is still the standard of care for most patients with adverse anatomical or ventilatory factors, even in ICUs with experience in percutaneous tracheostomy.",
