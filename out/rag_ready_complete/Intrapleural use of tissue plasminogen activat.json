    "abstract": "Background More than 30% of patients with pleural infection either die or require surgery. Drainage of infected fluid is key to successful treatment, but intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy did not improve outcomes in an earlier, large, randomized trial.\nMethods We conducted a blinded, 2-by-2 factorial trial in which 210 patients with pleural infection were randomly assigned to receive one of four study treatments for 3 days: double placebo, intrapleural tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and DNase, t-PA and placebo, or DNase and placebo. The primary outcome was the change in pleural opacity, measured as the percentage of the hemithorax occupied by effusion, on chest radiography on day 7 as compared with day 1. Secondary outcomes included referral for surgery, duration of hospital stay, and adverse events.\nResults The mean (±SD) change in pleural opacity was greater in the t-PA–DNase group than in the placebo group (−29.5±23.3% vs. −17.2±19.6%; difference, −7.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], −13.4 to −2.4; P = 0.005); the change observed with t-PA alone and with DNase alone (−17.2±24.3 and −14.7±16.4%, respectively) was not significantly different from that observed with placebo. The frequency of surgical referral at 3 months was lower in the t-PA–DNase group than in the placebo group (2 of 48 patients [4%] vs. 8 of 51 patients [16%]; odds ratio for surgical referral, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.87; P = 0.03) but was greater in the DNase group (18 of 46 patients [39%]) than in the placebo group (odds ratio, 3.56; 95% CI, 1.30 to 9.75; P=0.01). Combined t-PA–DNase therapy was associated with a reduction in the hospital stay, as compared with placebo (difference, −6.7 days; 95% CI, −12.0 to −1.9; P=0.006); the hospital stay with either agent alone was not significantly different from that with placebo. The frequency of adverse events did not differ significantly among the groups.\nConclusions Intrapleural t-PA–DNase therapy improved fluid drainage in patients with pleural infection and reduced the frequency of surgical referral and the duration of the hospital stay. Treatment with DNase alone or t-PA alone was ineffective.

      "content": "Intrapleural t-PA-DNase therapy improved fluid drainage in patients with pleural infection and reduced the frequency of surgical referral and the duration of the hospital stay. Treatment with DNase alone or t-PA alone was ineffective. (Funded by an unrestricted educational grant to the University of Oxford from Roche UK and by others; Current Controlled Trials number, ISRCTN57454527.)\nP leural infection affects more than 65,000 patients each year in the United States and the United Kingdom, 1 and the incidence is increasing in both countries - in both children 2-4 and adults. 5,6 The mortality rate from pleural infection is between 10% and 20%, 5,7-9 and drainage through a chest tube and administration of antibiotics fail in approximately one third of patients, who then require surgical drainage. 5,9 The median duration of the hospital stay for these patients is 12 to 15 days, 5,6,8,9 with 25% hospitalized for more than a month. Care of each patient costs approximately  $5,000, 10,11 totaling  more  than $320 million per year in the United Kingdom and United States combined.\nStandard therapy consists of antibiotics and tube drainage of the infected pleural fluid; surgery is required when sepsis and infected fluid are not effectively controlled. Observational data suggest  that  intrapleural  administration  of  fibrinolytic drugs reduces the frequency of failed drainage and subsequent surgery by cleaving intrapleural fibrinous  septations  and  improving  chest-tube drainage, 12-17 but the large First Multicenter Intrapleural Sepsis Trial (MIST1) 9 showed no benefit of intrapleural streptokinase; this finding was subsequently supported by a meta-analysis. 18\nThe hypothesis that the division of pleural septations with the use of fibrinolytic agents would result in improved pleural drainage has strong clinical and scientific support 19 ; thus, this trial used a different direct-acting fibrinolytic agent, recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). Data from case series support this approach in adults 20,21 and children. 22-27 Because the presence of extracellular DNA and other bacterial components in the pleural space may increase viscosity and permit biofilm formation, 28-32 we also tested the use of recombinant human DNase. 33,34 Intrapleural DNase (5 mg twice daily) has been shown in an animal model 35 and in a small case series 36,37 to be a potential treatment for pleural infection.",

All analyses were planned before any data analysis was performed, except as otherwise\nspecified.  For  patients  who  died  or  underwent surgery before day 7, the last chest radiograph obtained after baseline but before surgery or death\nwas used as the day 7 radiograph for purposes of analysis.\nWe conducted a standard factorial-study analysis, with an initial test for interaction between DNase, t-PA, 39 and the outcome. If the result of the interaction test was nonsignificant, we conducted a factorial analysis, but if the result was significant (at the 5% level), we instead compared each intervention group with placebo. All analyses were adjusted on the basis of the area of effusion on chest radiography at baseline 40 and for minimization factors. 41-43\nContinuous outcomes were analyzed by means of linear regression models, and binary outcomes were analyzed with the use of logistic-regression models. The white-cell count, C-reactive protein level, and temperature were analyzed longitudinally with the use of mixed-effects models. Stata software, version 11, was used for data analyses.\nOn the basis of the MIST1 trial, 9 we assumed that the area of pleural opacity 1 week after randomization would be halved in 50% of patients receiving double placebo. Therefore, our study was powered to determine whether intrapleural DNase or t-PA therapy could increase the proportion of patients who had a 50% reduction in the area of opacity, from 50% of patients to 70%. To detect this difference using a factorial design (and assuming no interaction), we calculated that we would need to enroll a total of 210 patients, randomly assigned in equal numbers to the four groups (for 80% power, with an alpha level of 0.05 and a 5% rate of noncompliance).",

      "content": "Our trial shows that as compared with placebo, combined  treatment  with  t-PA  and  DNase  improved the drainage of infected fluid in patients\nwith pleural infection. Each of the agents alone was ineffective. The reduction in the infected pleural fluid collection was approximately doubled with the use of the combination therapy (with clearing of approximately 30% of the ipsilateral hemithorax volume  and  approximately  a  60%  reduction  in the baseline pleural collection). This new treatment effect was not associated with an excess of adverse events.\nIn addition to the drainage benefit, t-PA-DNase therapy may improve the natural history of pleural infection. The group of patients receiving the combination treatment had 77% fewer referrals for thoracic surgery and a 6.7-day reduction in the hospital stay, as compared with the patients receiving placebo. Larger studies are needed to assess this benefit more precisely.\nNo drainage benefit was seen with either t-PA alone or DNase alone (Fig. 2). This result supports data from the MIST1 trial, 9 which remain a source of clinical debate. 44-48 It is unclear why fibrinolytic agents do not appear to be helpful in patients with extensive deposition of fibrin in the pleural space. 49-51 This lack of efficacy suggests that free DNA cleavage is necessary to reduce fluid viscosity and permit pleural clearance by fibrinolytic drugs. A similar treatment combination has been shown to be helpful in other diseases. 52-54 The current trial somewhat clarifies this debate by showing that the use of a different fibrinolytic  agent  (i.e.,  t-PA  rather  than  streptokinase) and the additional cleavage of uncoiled DNA by DNase may have allowed  fibrinolytic  treatment to work. This observation is consistent with in vitro studies 33,34 and an animal model 35 of pleural infection, which show that free DNA cleavage  is  necessary  to  reduce  fluid  viscosity  and permit pleural clearance by fibrinolytic drugs. Thus, our results are consistent with the MIST1 results and suggest a new therapeutic strategy for this disease.\nDNase monotherapy was ineffective in improving pleural drainage and was associated with an increase in surgical referrals by a factor of 3. Independent review of the indications for surgery indicated that this was due to clinical evidence of worsening  infection.  We  hypothesize  that  this deterioration may be due to systemic absorption of bacterial or inflammatory components after DNase-mediated biofilm disruption in a pleural space with ineffective drainage due to undisrupted fibrinous septations. Whatever the mechanism, our study shows that DNase monotherapy pro-\n3 col SIZE Revised ARTIST: ts Each circle represents an individual patient, and mean changes are indicated by the horizontal bars.\n16p6\n4-C\nH/T\nLine\nCombo\nAUTHOR, PLEASE NOTE:\nTYPE:\nvides no fluid-drainage benefit and significantly increases the need for surgery, and it should therefore be avoided.\nThe area of the pleural effusion was reduced by 17% from baseline in the placebo group in this study. This finding underscores the need for placebo-controlled trials to establish the efficacy of intrapleural adjuvant therapies in patients with pleural infection, since in the absence of a robust trial design, we cannot assume that radiographic improvements from baseline are true treatment effects.\nOur trial shows that combination intrapleural t-PA and DNase therapy improves the drainage of pleural fluid in patients with pleural infection and that such treatment is associated with reductions in the hospital stay and the need for thoracic surgery  that  are  likely  to  be  clinically  significant. This combined treatment may therefore be useful\nin patients in whom standard medical management has failed and thoracic surgery is not a treatment option. However, appropriate trials are needed to accurately define the treatment effects. If confirmed in further studies, our results will inform the choice of intrapleural adjuvant therapy for pleural infection and improve the management of this disorder.\nSupported by an unrestricted educational grant from Roche UK to the University of Oxford and by grants from the Oxford Biomedical  Research  Centre  Programme,  through  the  United Kingdom National Institute for Health Research (to Drs.
