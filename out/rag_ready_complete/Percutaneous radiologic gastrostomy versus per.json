Our objective was to compare indications, complications, efficacy and outcomes of these two techniques. Methods: Records of 370 patients with feeding tubes placed either endoscopically by gastroenterology, or fluoroscopically by radiology, at our university-based tertiary care center over a 54-month period were reviewed. Results: 177 gastrostomies were placed endoscopically and 193 fluoroscopically. Nutrition was the most common indication in each group (94 and 92%), but the most common underlying diagnosis was neurologic impairment in the endoscopic group ( n =89, 50%) and malignancy in the fluoroscopic group ( n =134, 69%) ( p <0.001). Complications in the first 30 days were more common with fluoroscopic placement (23% versus 11%, p =0.002), with infection most frequent. Correlates of late complications were inpatient status (Odds ratio (OR) 0.26, 95%CI: 0.13-0.51) and a diagnosis of malignancy (Odds ratio (OR) 2.2, 95%CI: 1.03-4.84). Average follow-up time was 108 days in the fluoroscopic group and 174 days in the endoscopic group. Conclusions: Both endoscopic and fluoroscopic gastrostomy tube placement are safe and effective. Outpatient status was associated with greater early and late complication rates; minor complications such as infection were greater in the fluoroscopic group, while malignancy was associated with late complications.

      "content": "Gastrostomy tubes are well tolerated for long term nutritional supplementation, generally provide improved quality of life when compared to available alternatives and limit disorders of intestinal motility by maintaining gastrointestinal tract function [1-3]. Gastrostomy tubes can be placed surgically, endoscopically and fluoroscopically; a review of the literature supports radiologic and endoscopic techniques as superior to surgery, requiring less sedation, less invasive placement techniques, having lower complication rates, and less costly [3-6]. Previous studies comparing percutaneous radiologic gastrostomy (PRG) and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement have suffered from small sample sizes and biased patient selection (studies with PRG have typically been done on those patients who previously failed PEG placement) [4-9].\nThe purpose of this study was to compare percutaneous radiologic and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement in a large-volume, single-center retrospective analysis of 193 PRG tubes and 177 PEG tubes placed over a 54-month period. We evaluated indications, complications and outcomes using medical records and telephone contact.",

A single gastrostomy tube was placed in February of 1997, and all other tubes were placed consecutively from July of 1997 through August 2001. Information was collected from both electronic and paper medical records including operative reports, inpatient and outpatient notes. Additional procedural and follow-up information was obtained via telephone calls to patients, next-of-kin and primary care providers.\nComplications were divided into early (occurring within 30 days after placement) and late (occurring after 30 days).\nComplications were further subdivided into major and minor categories. Major adverse events were defined as those requiring surgery or hospitalization, causing permanent adverse sequelae, or resulting in death. Minor adverse events were defined as those requiring either minor or no treatment and resulting in no permanent sequelae.\nMinor peristomal infections were defined as infections at the gastrostomy tube site which required a course of oral antibiotics without further treatment. Further therapy, such as surgical debridement, was considered major. Leakage of gastric juice was considered minor if it caused the patient to seek medical attention and required specific local treatment.\nIf the tube had to be manually re-positioned by a healthcare provider it was considered a minor complication. If the tube was misplaced and required removal and surgical intervention for repositioning it was considered a major complication. If a tube either fell out or was pulled out and had to be replaced by a healthcare provider it was counted as a minor complication for inadvertent removal. Pain requiring medical attention was considered a minor complication.\nMiscellaneous minor complications included tube migration (e.g. through the pylorus), bleeding which did not require interventions such as suturing or transfusion, tube malfunction and aspiration.",

Informed written consent was obtained from the patient or proxy.\nPreprocedure sonographic examination of the abdomen performed for left liver edge localization.\nGastric insufflation was achieved either by having the patient swallow effervescent crystals (EZEm Inc.; Westbury, NY) or by advancing a five French Berenstein catheter (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA) into the stomach under fluoroscopic guidance via nasal approach. Effervescent crystals were not used in patients with aspiration risks.\nThe abdomen was prepped and draped in sterile fashion. Local anesthesia was administered to the abdominal wall. Conscious sedation was administered using a combination of intravenous versed and fentanyl in all suitable patients.\nThe access site was localized via fluoroscopic examination of the insufflated stomach. Where necessary, in patients with tumoral implants or altered anatomy, CT guidance was used to guide stomach access. Two to three T-fastener gastropexy sutures were placed percutaneously to bring the anterior stomach wall into contact with the anterior abdominal wall. An 18-gauge needle was used to access the gastric lumen. Placement was confirmed with air aspiration and contrast injection. A 0.035 heavy-duty guidewire was advanced through the needle into the stomach, the needle was withdrawn and the tract dilated. The gastrostomy tube was advanced into the stomach over the wire and the wire was withdrawn. The pigtail locking mechanism was deployed and contrast was injected via the tube for final placement confirmation. Catheters were not sutured in place. Tubes were not used for 24 h following placement, to deter against possible risk of cutaneous and intraperitoneal leakage. Prophylactic antibiotics were not routinely administered [10].\nGastropexy sutures were removed at 10 days, at which time the access site was evaluated. The patient was then followed regularly by the ostomy care nurses and referring team.\nOstomy nurses taught gastrostomy care to outpatients before the tube was placed.

      "content": "At our institution, PEG tubes are placed using the 'pull' technique, which was first described by Gauderer et al. in 1980 [11].\nPreprocedure, outpatients were admitted through the same-day program. Assuming no drug allergies, Cefotetan 1 g was given intravenously on call to the procedure. Once the patient was in the Endoscopy Suite, the upper endoscope was passed from the mouth into the stomach, which was inflated with air to allow the anterior wall to meet the abdominal wall. The abdominal wall was transilluminated with light from the endoscope. The site of maximal transillumination was chosen as the insertion site. The site was marked, the abdominal wall was cleaned and draped in a sterile fashion, and local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine was instilled. A small incision was made in the skin over the site. A sheathed needle was passed percutaneously into the stomach and a suture was threaded through the catheter once the needle was removed. The suture was grasped with a snare through the endoscope and drawn back through the mouth. The percutaneous gastrostomy tube was attached to the thread and pulled through the mouth, down the esophagus, into the stomach, and through the abdominal wall, after which it was secured with a plastic bolster. The endoscope could then be reinserted to check for positioning, and to be certain that the tension on the tube was not excessive. Feeding through the gastrostomy tube could begin after 24 h. If the patient was an inpatient, the gastroenterology fellow checked the tube the next day. Care instructions were provided to the nursing staff and referring team. If the patient was an outpatient, care instructions were provided upon discharge, and often the patient was seen in the Gastroenterology outpatient clinic 7-10 days later for a tube check and consideration of loosening the bolster. Long-term follow-up of PEG tubes at our institution was done on an as-needed basis with the ostomy nurses, or in the gastroenterology clinic.\nAll attempts at gastrostomy tube placement were technically successful.",

Major complications affected 2.1% of the PRG patients overall.\nThe first early major complication involved an outpatient with stage IV squamous cell cancer of the tongue who presented with shortness of breath and cellulitis around the G tube site 7 days post-placement. Exploratory laparotomy diagnosed previously unknown gastric implant; anterior wedge gastrectomy and abdominal wall debridement performed; jejunostmy tube placed and intravenous antibiotics administered. The second early major complication was in an outpatient with stage III squamous cell cancer of the tonsil. Three days following placement he was admitted for extensive cellulitis of the anterior abdominal wall. The tube was removed and treatment with intravenous antibiotics instituted. The infection resolved, and another PRG tube was placed without complication. The third early major complication was in a patient with severely impaired cognition and agitation. Five days after the tube was placed, she presented with fever and abdominal discomfort and presumed infection. Exploratory\nComparisons between endoscopic and fluoroscopic placement were made using t -tests for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables.\nlaparotomy demonstrated that the gastrostomy tube had migrated out of the stomach, and was free in the peritoneal cavity. The tube was removed, the peritoneal cavity irrigated and a jejunostomy tube was placed.\nThe single late major complication occurred in an outpatient 4 months after her gastrostomy tube was removed. PRG originally placed for nutritional supplementation while she was on a ventilator for a prolonged period following open cardiac surgery. Twenty-five days after the gastrostomy tube was placed, it was removed, as she was able to maintain adequate oral intake. A draining tract and hematoma persisted at the gastrostomy tube site. The tract was excised and it was discovered that the tube had passed through the left lobe of the liver. The hematoma was evacuated and the fistula oversewn.\nIn the PEG group there were two early major complications. The first involved a 72-year-old female who suffered acute inferior wall myocardial infarction. PEG was placed after a month-long, complicated hospitalization. Postplacement, she developed bradycardia and hypotension requiring fluids, dopamine, and temporary pacing for 24 h. The second early major complication in the PEG group occurred in a 78-year-old man who attempted suicide by caustic ingestion. Initial EGD revealed stage III alkaline injury to the esophagus and scattered gastric fundal erosions. Seven days after admission, a PEG was placed without incident. Eleven days after the procedure, he complained of abdominal pain. CT scan of the chest and abdomen was obtained, demonstrating that the PEG had migrated out of the stomach, and that the internal bolster was lodged between the stomach and abdominal walls. Surgical repair for gastric perforation was performed without sequelae.",

The intubation of the endoscope through the pharynx was difficult, requiring initial passage of a Maloney bougie. The esophagus was normal, but endoscopy of the stomach and duodenum revealed a large hiatal hernia and many non-bleeding superficial duodenal ulcers.

      "content": "Major PRG and PEG complication rates reported in the literature range from 2.2 to 22.5% [4,12,13] and 12.9 to 17% [3,5] respectively as compared to our population rates of 2.1 and 1.1% for PRG and PEG procedures. Major complication rates, early and late, did not significantly differ between PRG and PEG patients.\nAs supported in the literature, most major PRG complications involved infection [3-5,14,15].\nEarly and late minor complication rates occurred in 22.8 and 23.8% of PRG patients respectively, in keeping with reported minor PRG complication rates of 2.9-36% [3,12,16]. Early and late minor PEG complication rates of 10.8 and 10.1% concurred with reported rates ranging from 8.3 to 65% [5,17]. Overall, in our study, radiologic placement was associated with significantly more early complications, but following adjustment, there was no difference in late complications between PRG and PEG.\nFewer minor complications were observed among inpatients, perhaps because inpatients might have benefitted from educatedandexperiencedhealthcareproviderscaringfornew gastrostomy tubes and possibly supplemental teaching from ostomy nurses. The patients who went home following gastrostomy placement may have been less likely to receive this same quality of care, or equal education opportunities.\nIn our institution, prophylactic antibiotics were routinely administered to PEG recipients but not so for PRG patients. Routine antibiotic prophylaxis for PRG tube placement has not been described as documented infectious complications following PRG have been infrequent [10,18]. Malignancy predominated among PRG patients (69.4%) and is a wellknownriskfactorforinfections as well as other complications [19,17,20-22]; neurologic impairment predominated among PEG patients (50.3%) while only 23.3% of PEG patients had underlying malignancy. Malignancy among the PRG may have predisposed this population to increased infection risk. Given the lack of described infectious complications among patients receiving PRG in the literature, treating all patients with prophylactic antibiotics may predispose resistance in this group [20,23]. Multivariate analysis showed that a diagnosis of malignancy was a statistically significant correlate of late complications. 87% of the patients who got local infections had a cancer diagnosis, as compared to 69.4% of the total study population. Even though patients with underlying diagnoses of cancer had higher infection rates, Pickhardt argues for radiologic gastrostomy tube placement in this population to avoid direct tumor metastatic implantation in patients with malignancies of the upper aerodigestive tract [24].\nPeristomal infection is a well-known problem with percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement [3,4]. Three recent randomized clinical trials of prophylactic antibiotic use with PEG placement have demonstrated a significantly decreased rate of infection in the short-term [17,21,22]. Without antibiotic prophylaxis, local wound infection was nine times more common among PEG patients than PRG patients [25]. Administration of prophylactic antibiotics has been proven to be effective in reducing infections during PEG placement and should be considered for routine use in PRG placement, especially in high-risk patients such as those with malignancy [17,21,22]. Although our study did not show an effect of malignancy on early complications, other studies [19] have attributed early infections to the prevalence of malignancy.\nAnother important difference in minor complications between the two groups was inadvertent tube removal. This was possibly secondary to differences in anchoring devices between PRG and PEG tubes. PRG tubes either have locking pigtail or inflatable balloon retention mechanisms while PEG tubes have small internal plastic discs and external plastic bolsters. Similar results have been reported in the literature. Cosentini et al. reported 18% of PRG cohort and 8% PEG cohort experienced dislodged tubes [3].\nThe lower rate of leakage in the PEG group (5.2% versus 0.6%) is also likely a reflection of the difference in gastrostomy devices, as well as patient education. Inpatient status was related to fewer complications, possibly because patients and caregivers were taught stoma surveillance and care during the hospitalization. Leakage of gastric contents causes painful irritation and infection of the peristomal skin. Excessive leakage can be a sign that the tube has clogged, kinked or migrated. Prevention of leakage and associated complications can be accomplished with good skin care, regular tube changes and patient education [26].\nDurability of the tubes was not statistically different for the two groups.\nThe percentage of patients with pain and other problems during the procedure was similar in both groups. Most PRG patients who experienced early pain reported marked improvement once the gastropexy sutures were removed. Gastropexy sutures however are an integral part of PRG placement technique and help to reduce the incidence of technical complications such as failed tube placement secondary to inadequate retention of the anterior gastric wall [27]. Two of the three PRG patients who experienced pain as a late complication were concurrently frequently vomiting due to chemotherapy; when vomiting ceased, so did their pain. Another cause of pain was excessive granulation tissue around the stoma tract. Local therapy with silver nitrate improved the situation in all cases.\nFour PEG patients experienced early pain and two, late pain. Five of these six patients improved after loosening the bolster. Possibly, once weight gain was established, the abdominal subcutaneous fat increased in thickness causing tightening of the bolster against the abdominal wall.\nCatheter migration was infrequently reported in our study though this potential complication is noteworthy to observe as two cases of death after delayed recognition of PEG tube migration and peritonitis have been reported in the literature [28].\nFour patients (2.1%) in the PRG group and two PEG patients (1.1%) experienced periprocedural complications. All were treated promptly without delayed sequelae.\nDisparity in indications is likely a reflection of referral patterns of the oncology and neurology staff at our center. Of the PRG patients, greater than two thirds were diagnosed with head and neck cancer (AJCC stage III or higher), while less than a third of the PEG group had a malignancy. Fewer than 20%ofthePRGpatientshadneurologicimpairment,whereas half of the PEG patients had neurologic impairment.\nPatients who require gastroenteric access through the anterior abdominal wall are likely to have worse pathology and a poorer prognosis than any disease-matched control group [19]. Digital medical records system and rural location of our center allowed for close patient follow-up over a prolonged period. Close patient follow-up, as compared to prior studies, may have led to the discovery of more disease which may, in turn, have caused inflation of our complication rates in comparison with other study populations [3,5,7,12,29,30].",

      "content": "Percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement is an excellent alternative to parenteral and nasogastric feeding for patients unable to maintain adequate oral nutrition. Both endoscopic and radiologic techniques are safe for placement and long term use, with few major complications and minor complications that were, for the most part, readily treated.\nStatistically significant correlations for early minor complications included percutaneous fluoroscopic placement and inpatient status. Early infections prevalent among PRG patients may be attributed to lack of antibiotic prophylaxis. Routine antibiotic coverage for PRG placement should be considered, especially for high-risk patients, such as those with malignancy.\nEducating both patients and healthcare providers about gastrostomy tube and stoma care may prevent pain and inadvertent removal. Regularly scheduled tube changes may decrease the amount of tube leakage, peristomal pain and local infection.\nBoth PRG and PEG are safe and effective. The differences in outcomes between them appear to be minor and relate largely to routine antibiotic use at the time of placement and may be, at least in part, attributed to underlying diagnoses among referred patients.",
