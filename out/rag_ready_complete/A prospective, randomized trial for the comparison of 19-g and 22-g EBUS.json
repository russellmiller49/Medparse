      "content": "Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer for men and women and the most frequent cause of cancer-related death worldwide. 1 Endobronchial ultrasound (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS))-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) is a well established method for lung cancer diagnosis and staging. 2-5 Current guidelines recommend at least 3 Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA samples from each enlarged lymph node with a 22-gauge (G) or 21-G needle to achieve diagnostic accuracy of up to 96%, 6-9 and 4 passes if additional molecular workup for epidermal growth factor receptor, Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog and/or anaplastic lymphoma kinase mutations is intended. 10 Although Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA samples are much smaller than surgical lymph node biopsies, enough material for complete and thorough evaluation is provided in most cases. 11-15 Although the diagnostic yield of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNAs is almost optimal with 90% to 95% using 22-G needles, recent developments in personalized medicine, particularly in pretreatment lung cancer management, require larger amounts of tissue for thorough molecular and other workup such as programmed death ligand 1 (PDL1) staining in addition to traditional pathology testing. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) samples obtained using a 22-G and even with a 21-G needle are sometimes not suf /uniFB01 cient for these extensive molecular analyses and PD-L1 staining. 10,16 The manufacturer, Olympus, has addressed this problem and recently developed a larger Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA needle. The 19-G Vizishot FLEX Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) needle (Olympus) has the same outer diameter as a 22-G Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) needle but a larger inner diameter. In addition the needle is composed of a more /uniFB02 exible material (nitinol) than the 22-G Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) needle.\nThe existing comparative data of 19-G needles compared with smaller-bore 22-G needles have failed to show a difference in the diagnostic yield and ability to obtain tissue cores. 17,18 However, this might have been limited because of relatively small sample sizes and variable methods to assess tissue quality. We hypothesized that the 19-G needle would yield more tissue, without increasing complications compared with 22-G needles. The aim of this prospective, randomized two-center study was to compare 19-G and 22-G Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) needles regarding specimen tissue quality and procedural safety. To improve the assessment of tissue quality, we sought to introduce a novel end point of tissue weight adjusted for blood content.",

Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) was performed using /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopy with an Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscope (model BF-UC180F; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) connected to an ultrasound scanner (EU-ME1 or EU-ME2, Olympus). Either the 19-G (NA-U402SX-4019; Olympus) or the 22-G (NA-201SX-4022; Olympus) needles were used by experienced attending interventional pulmonologists. Additional suction was not applied. Simple randomization to the 19-G or 22-G group was performed using a randomization list (Microsoft Excel 2013) in the bronchoscopy suite before the procedure. Patients underwent lymph node biopsy with the use of either a 19-G or a 22-G needle. Patients and pathologists were blinded for the needle size. The lymph node biopsy procedure was standardized as follows: all patients received a complete mediastinal and hilar lymph node staging via Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), sampling all lymph nodes larger than 5 mm. The lymph node with the highest probability for malignant in /uniFB01 ltration on the basis of size and sonographic appearance was sampled with 3 to 5 passes. 6,19,20 Each pass consisted of 10 to 15 needle thrusts. Samples were considered adequate if cytological analysis identi /uniFB01 ed lymphocytes or if a de /uniFB01 nitive diagnosis could be established. In this study rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) was omitted. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA samples were expelled from the needle into a vessel of 5 mL 4% buffered formalin using the internal stylet in accordance with recent guideline recommendations 21 and were subsequently sent for cytopathological evaluation. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed for lung cancer subtyping if required. Blood content of each sample was evaluated using a semiquantitative score from 0 to 2 (0 ¼ no visible blood, 1 ¼ light red shading, 2 ¼ red shading; Figure 1). Each lymph node sample was weighed on a pathology slide using a precision balance (Sartorius BP61, Goettingen, Germany) and divided by the number of passes. Each lymph node size was recorded on the basis of the computed tomography (CT) scan image and con /uniFB01 rmed via Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) image.

      "content": "Endobronchial ultrasound-guided TBNA has been shown to provide a high diagnostic yield and few post procedural complications. 3,4,22 However, with the advent of personalized therapy the collection of more tissue material for molecular and other workup in addition to traditional pathology testing is essential, including nextgeneration sequencing analysis and PD-L1 staining to evaluate the therapeutic option of immunotherapy. Several studies have shown, that although the diagnostic yield of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA samples is nearly optimal with 22-G and 21-G needles, the obtained material is not always suf /uniFB01 cient for extensive molecular workup and PD-L1 staining. 10,16,23\nIn this prospective, randomized two-center trial we provide a prospective comparison of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA biopsy with 19-G versus 22-G needles. This trial was designed to test the tissue quality of the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) sample, which was signi /uniFB01 cantly improved using the 19-G needle, even after correction for blood content (Table 3). The introduction of the 19-G needle has raised concerns about increased blood content. In our comparison of the 2 needle sizes we used a\nsemiquantitative blood content score when comparing the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) sample weights. We found that 19-G needle samples showed signi /uniFB01 cantly more blood content as shown in Figure 1. This /uniFB01 nding is consistent with that of previous studies, including 2 smaller trials that compared 19-G and 22-G Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) needles, suggesting increased blood content for larger needles. 7,17,18 In the study by Nakajima et al, who compared 22-G and 21-G needles, increased blood content was also documented. 7 In that study the authors described if a sample contained more or less blood using the 21-G needle or the 22-G needle without mentioning the exact amount or using a score. 7 Of note, in the study by Nakajima et al, 2 needle sizes were used on the same lymph node; in this trial only a single needle was used per patient, making direct comparison of the blood content more dif /uniFB01 cult. Saji et al also compared 21-G and 22-G EBUSTBNAs. They used the width of the sample as a parameter of tissue quality and reported not to have assessed the weight of the sample because of differences in blood content. 24 They did not report any differences between the sample widths of specimens obtained with a 21-G or a 22-G needle, however, a single dimension is probably not suf /uniFB01 cient to assess the size of a sample. In a recently published retrospective trial comparing 22-G and 19-G Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA samples, the volume of the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA samples was assessed. To overcome the blood content effect, the tissue samples were placed on /uniFB01 lter paper. 25 The authors conclude that volumes of 19-G Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) samples were larger, however, the retrospective nature of the report did not allow sample size calculation and only 45 patients were studied. Also, one could argue that through putting the sample on /uniFB01 lter paper, cells would get lost, and it would be hard to control how many tumor cells are actually lost and not be counted for the secondary end point of tumor cell",

      "title": "Comparison of 19-G and 22-G EBUS-TBNA Needles",
      "content": "-\ncontent. A recent randomized trial to compare 19-G and 22-G needles in a smaller cohort used tissue core procurement as a primary end point, and tissue surface area as a secondary end point,\nbloodiness of samples was assessed using a microscope. 17 The authors did not report signi /uniFB01 cant differences between the groups regarding tissue core procurement or tissue surface area, however,\n-\nthey reported that signi /uniFB01 cantly bloodier samples were obtained with a 19-G needle. Chaddha et al prospectively compared 27 patients sampled with a 19-G and a 22-G needle using diagnostic yield as a primary end point and assessed the bloodiness of samples in the ROSE slide. Signi /uniFB01 cant differences between the 2 groups regarding diagnostic yield were not reported; the authors reported signi /uniFB01 cantly higher blood content in the ROSE slide of 19-G samples. 18 Our results are consistent with the 2 previously mentioned trials, showing similar diagnostic yield and larger blood amount in 19-G samples. Because of the high diagnostic yield for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) exceeding 90%, it is not surprising that no differences were detected. A problem with both studies was the relatively small size. In our current study, we have overcome some of the methodological problems of comparing tissue quality, and introduced a novel end point of tissue weight corrected for blood content, which is clinically more meaningful with regard to molecular analyses.\nWe believe that the assessment of blood content using the mentioned semiquantitative score is more adequate than other methods to assess the blood content of samples. However, we are aware that it is technically not feasible to document the exact amount of blood in milliliters, because the sample is either collected in a vessel pre /uniFB01 lled with formalin or on a slide. The prospective nature of our trial with a sample size calculation is a strength, showing a signi /uniFB01 cantly higher blood content in 19-G Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA samples and also a signi /uniFB01 cantly higher tissue amount per sample in the 19-G group after correction for blood content.\nThe number of tumor cells obtained using Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA biopsy is another marker of tissue quality, and was a secondary end point in this study. We show that tumor cell counts per slide in Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)-in /uniFB01 ltrated Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) samples are signi /uniFB01 cantly higher if sampled with a 19-G needle (Figure 4). In this study only 43 lymph nodes (40.2%) were in /uniFB01 ltrated with Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); tumor cells were counted in 37 patients (86%), and these results should be validated in studies with a higher amount of samples. The groups of other tumor entities such as SCLC were too small for reliable comparisons. However, because of the larger tissue amounts sampled with the 19-G needle and higher tumor cell counts in the Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)-in /uniFB01 ltrated samples and a previously reported signi /uniFB01 -cant correlation between Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) sample weights and DNA content it is very likely that SCLC tumor cell counts would also be signi /uniFB01 cantly higher if sampled with a 19-G needle compared with a 22-G needle. 21 Tumor cell counts per biopsy might be in /uniFB02 uenced by several factors: the biology of the tumor, the pattern of lymph node in /uniFB01 ltration by tumor cells, and the angle at which the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA needle is inserted into the lymph node. One of the limitations of this study was that a single needle size was used for each patient. Because cellularity of tumors can vary between patients, the differences between the tumor cell counts might have been even more signi /uniFB01 cant if needles of both sizes were used in the same lymph node in every patient; this might be considered in future studies. We still believe, that with the calculated sample size and overall similar lymph node sizes in both groups, the results would have been very similar if 2 needles would have been used per lymph node.\nWe recently published that there is a signi /uniFB01 cant correlation between tissue weight of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA samples and genomic DNA (gDNA) concentration. 23 Although not proven with further molecular or sequencing workup in this study, we assume that a larger sample with signi /uniFB01 cantly more gDNA will in turn yield a\ngreater amount of tumor gDNA. Tumor gDNA yield is essential for the performance of next-generation sequencing, which is increasingly demanded for personalized therapy and usually requires higher amounts ( > 40 ng) of DNA than is needed for polymerase chain reaction-based diagnostic tests. The effect of additional nodal tissue weight obtained using the 19-G needle on the ability to enable comprehensive molecular analyses and PD-L1 staining should be further investigated. There are multiple factors that might increase the adequacy and utility of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) biopsies. In particular, ROSE was associated with increased adequacy for diagnostic and molecular analyses. 26-28 In this study, ROSE was omitted because the entire sample was weighed in the formalin vessel. The effect of ROSE on the reported /uniFB01 ndings should be investigated in further studies.\nRegarding the safety pro /uniFB01 le, we found that the use of the 19-G needle is as safe as the use of the 22-G needle. There were no severe complications in either group. All procedure-related complications were related to bleeding from the biopsy site. We observed 4 cases of moderate bleeding, which were distributed equally between groups. Two patients experienced moderate bleeding (1 per group), both of which had received therapeutic anticoagulation until the evening before the intervention and therefore had an increased bleeding risk. Overall the bleeding risk with both needles is minimal and not increased with use of a larger needle size.",

      "title": "Limitations",
      "content": "Several limitations in this study need to be acknowledged. Although we were successful in showing a signi /uniFB01 cantly larger tissue weight in the 19-G group when corrected for blood content, the comparison of secondary end points was limited by the sample size in some of the groups such as SCLC. Additionally, the overall complication rate of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA is known to be low, and larger cohorts will be necessary to assess rates of rare, severe complications. 29-31 However, we do not anticipate signi /uniFB01 cant differences in complication rates on the basis of our results and those of previous retrospective studies on 19-G EBUSTBNA needles with smaller patient cohorts, which reported similar complication rates and diagnostic yields. 25,32,33 Last, the comparative evaluation of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) samples for molecular testing extends beyond the scope of this trial. Although we clearly showed that 19-G needles can yield more tissue and tumor cells and have previously shown a significant correlation between Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA weight and DNA concentration, we are unable to correlate this with the adequacy for various molecular tests in this study. The absolute tissue amount required to ful /uniFB01 ll all current and future diagnostic tests likely varies signi /uniFB01 cantly between institutions, and depends largely on the extent and type of tests performed. One could argue that acquisition of more cores with a smaller needle (22-G) would lead to the same tissue amount, however, because of high costs of procedural times ($10-$60 per minute) and busy clinical schedules, it would be bene /uniFB01 cial to reduce procedural durations even minimally. 34",
