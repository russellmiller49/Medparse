    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (BLVR) has emerged as a promising therapeutic option for patients with COPD. The development of a dedicated BLVR program requires significant resources, both from an interventional pulmonology (IP) team and from the medical center. The financial value of this program is important to assess to develop a feasible and sustainable plan for providing this service in the future. RESEARCH QUESTION: Can a BLVR program bring value to a medical center in terms of patient referrals, revenue, and contribution margin? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients who were referred for BLVR to the interventional pulmonology clinic at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC). Patient demographics were obtained. Outpatient services used to determine candidacy for endobronchial valve placement were analyzed and revenue was estimated. For patients who had valve placement, revenue from the bronchoscopic procedure and subsequent inpatient hospitalization was calculated and the contribution margin of the procedure was estimated. RESULTS: An estimated total of $1 to 1.4 million in revenue was generated in the workup and placement of endobronchial valves for 37 patients. The total revenue for the care of 52 patients deemed not to be candidates for the valve procedure was $144,000 to $170,000. The contribution margin for the procedure was estimated to be 25%. The median length of stay was 3 days. Among all 89 patients referred for BLVR, 26 referrals were made to other specialties at BIDMC during workup. Of these patients, 69.6% were new patients referred to BIDMC for BLVR. INTERPRETATION: In addition to the established therapeutic benefit of BLVR for patients with COPD, a BLVR program in a dedicated, specialized center is economically valuable and sustainable, attracts referrals from other medical centers and health care systems, and generates internal referrals within the medical center.",

However, there is little evidence regarding the utility of bronchoscopy for determining the side of embolization prior to BAE in nonintubated patients with hemoptysis admitted to general wards.\nRESEARCH QUESTION: Is bronchoscopy necessary prior to BAE in nonintubated patients with hemoptysis following bronchiectasis and chronic pulmonary infection?\nSTUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Data from 93 consecutive nonintubated general ward patients with bronchiectasis and chronic pulmonary infection (nontuberculous mycobacteriosis, aspergillosis, and TB) who underwent de novo BAE from September 2017 to August 2023 were retrospectively reviewed. The contribution of bronchoscopy in deciding the side of embolization was evaluated.\nRESULTS: All patients underwent CT imaging and 27 also underwent bronchoscopy. Bronchoscopy identi /uniFB01 ed the sides of bleeding in 9 patients, but these sides could be correctly estimated in 8 of them from the CT information alone. Bronchoscopy did not reveal the side of bleeding in 18 patients, whose sides of embolization were decided using CT imaging and angiographic information. Of 66 patients without bronchoscopy, the sides of embolization were decided in 63 patients using CT imaging and angiographic information, but the priority of the embolization side could not be decided in the remaining 3 patients. Overall, 96% (89 of 93) of patients did not require bronchoscopy as part of their embolization plan. The 90-day overall survival and hemoptysis-free survival rates were 98.9% (95% CI, 92.5-99.8) and 92.3% (95% CI, 84.6-96.3), respectively.\nINTERPRETATION: This study showed that bronchoscopy contributed little to the planning of BAE in nonintubated patients with hemoptysis following bronchiectasis and chronic pulmonary infection. Our /uniFB01 ndings do not support the routine use of bronchoscopy prior to BAE in this population.

However, the clinical utility of bronchoscopy varies according to the phase, severity, and etiology. 1-5 Bronchial artery embolization (BAE) is one of the optimal treatments for both massive/life-threatening and mild to moderate hemoptysis; when performing\nBAE, lateralization is crucial for a safe and effective procedure. 4,6,7 However, lateralization is often problematic in patients with hemoptysis due to bronchiectasis and chronic pulmonary infection (eg, nontuberculous mycobacteriosis, aspergillosis, TB), the leading causes of hemoptysis and common indications for BAE, 8-10 because these patients usually have bilateral lung involvement and concomitant multiple nonbronchial systemic arteries. 11\nSeveral studies on massive hemoptysis, including in ICU patients, reported that CT imaging revealed the site of bleeding in 70% to 89% of cases, questioning the utility of bronchoscopy prior to BAE. 7,12 Furthermore, there is little evidence regarding the ef /uniFB01 cacy and safety of bronchoscopy for lateralization prior to BAE in nonintubated patients with hemoptysis admitted to general wards, although the risks of bronchoscopy are of greater concern (eg, airway compromise due to sedation, delay in de /uniFB01 nitive treatment, hypoxemia, high cost). 1,6,7,9 The aim of the current study therefore was to evaluate the role of bronchoscopy in the planning of BAE in nonintubated patients with hemoptysis caused by bronchiectasis and chronic pulmonary infection.",

In our institution, pulmonologists perform all treatment procedures regarding hemoptysis (eg, medication, respiratory and critical care, bronchoscopy, interventional radiology). Angiographic procedures for aortic\narteries were performed by using the femoral approach, whereas those for subclavian and axillary arteries were performed by using the radial or brachial approach. Aortography was not performed. All possible culprit arteries on MDCT imaging were then re-examined; angiography was performed by hand injection, as was selective angiography using a 4F or 5F guide catheter. Arteries with the following angiographic characteristics were considered abnormal and underwent super-selective embolization using a microcatheter: (1) densely stained lung parenchyma with hypervascularity (dilatation and tortuosity); (2) systemic-pulmonary shunting; or (3) aneurysmal formation. 8,11,14 Platinum coils, N-butyl-2cyanoacrylate, and gelatin sponge particles were used as embolic agents.\nIn the current study, embolization of unilateral/bilateral vessels was de /uniFB01 ned as that of unilateral/bilateral nonbronchial systemic arteries.

Characteristics of the patients are summarized in Table 1. The predominant etiologies were nontuberculous mycobacteriosis and non-cystic /uniFB01 brosis bronchiectasis. The amount of hemoptysis was mild, moderate, and massive in 14 (15%), 60 (65%), and 19 (20%) patients, respectively. Eighty-two (88%) patients experienced recurrent episodes of hemoptysis. The median intervals between the last day of hemoptysis and the /uniFB01 rst CT scan, bronchoscopy, and BAE were 1 (interquartile range [IQR], 0-3; range, 0-191) day, 4 (IQR, 2-10.5; range, 134) days, and 15 (IQR, 9-28; range, 2-212) days.\nThe results of bronchoscopy are summarized in Table 2.

In our observations, 96% of patients did not require bronchoscopy for the planning of BAE. Importantly, the sides of hemorrhage identi /uniFB01 ed by bronchoscopy were the same as those with the dominant lung involvement on CT imaging, suggesting that CT imaging alone is suf /uniFB01 cient to identify the bleeding side prior to BAE. In addition, the accuracy of bronchoscopy to identify the bleeding side decreased over time, and bronchoscopy-related complications occurred in 19% (5 of 27) of cases.\nData are presented as medians and interquartile ranges (quartiles 1 to 3) or no. (%). ASP ¼ aspergillosis; BAE ¼ bronchial artery embolization; BE ¼ bronchiectasis; FB ¼ /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopy; NTM ¼ nontuberculous mycobacteriosis.\n]\nIn practice, /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopy is considered reliable for lateralization in patients with hemoptysis. 1,4 However, in the current study, the bleeding side was determined in 68% (n ¼ 63; Group D) of patients using only CT scanning and angiographic information. In addition, bronchoscopy failed to identify the bleeding side in 18 patients (Groups B and C); the side prioritized for embolization was determined by using CT imaging and angiographic information alone in the majority of cases (n ¼ 13; Group B). Moreover, although the bleeding side was shown in bronchoscopy in 9 patients (Group A), it was also determined by CT alone in the majority of cases (n ¼ 8; Group A2). Overall, 96% (89 of 93) of patients did not require bronchoscopy as part of their embolization plan. Furthermore, the overall survival and hemoptysis-free survival rates at 90 days were high, and no cases of treatment failure due to inappropriate choice of the side of embolization were observed. These results show that bronchoscopy actually contributed little to the planning of BAE and that CT imaging alone was suf /uniFB01 cient to develop a treatment strategy for BAE. One possible factor could be the difference in the immediacy between these tools. In the current study, the median interval between hemoptysis and CT imaging and bronchoscopy was 1 and 4 days, respectively. Another possible factor is that not only hemorrhage but also underlying vascular abnormalities, knowledge of which is crucial for planning of BAE, are visualized on CT imaging but not on bronchoscopy. 17\nFlexible bronchoscopy has many roles in the overall management of hemoptysis, such as the diagnosis of etiologies, biopsy (especially in malignant cases), a guide for intubation, hemostatic procedure (eg, bronchial blocker placement and spigot), and clot extraction. 1,9 However, based on our results, in patients whose etiologies are easy to diagnose and sources of bleeding are relatively easy to estimate from their pulmonary involvements observed via CT imaging (bronchiectasis and cavities), such as BAE candidates with bronchiectasis and chronic pulmonary infections, there is little need for bronchoscopy in the acute phase of hemoptysis as long as CT imaging is performed immediately following hemoptysis and BAE is scheduled for the near future. Several previous studies on massive hemoptysis or hemoptysis requiring ICU treatment, although they were small studies with heterogeneous populations, also reported that radiographic assessment could replace bronchoscopy for determining the site/side of bleeding. 7,12 Bronchoscopy prior to BAE seems to have become less critical owing to the routine use of MDCT imaging since the 2000s, 6,7,18 unlike in the past when CT imaging and bronchoscopy were complementary in the localization and diagnosis of hemoptysis. 19\nThe current results also suggest that bronchoscopy should be conducted promptly if CT imaging fails to identify the side of bleeding. In this study, the bleeding\nData are presented as medians and interquartile ranges (quartiles 1 to 3) or no.

This /uniFB01 nding is consistent with that of previous studies on massive hemoptysis, 7,12 which reported that the source of active bleeding is most likely to be localized when bronchoscopy is performed during active hemoptysis or within 24 to 48 hours of\ncessation. Conversely, a multicenter study reported that early bronchoscopy (ie, during active bleeding or # 48 hours after hemoptysis ceased) in detecting the source of bleeding was only bene /uniFB01 cial for cases with a high volume of hemoptysis ( > 20 mL/d) 13 ; therefore, selecting cases with massive hemoptysis may increase the diagnostic rate of bronchoscopy.\nThe complications of bronchoscopy, which occurred in 19% (5 of 27) of cases, were also highlighted in the current study. Moreover, the complication rate increased to 30% (3 of 10) when the procedure was performed within 2 days of hemoptysis. Complications leading to respiratory compromise are of greater concern for nonintubated patients with hemoptysis in general wards; for intubated patients, these complications are manageable because bronchoscopy is easy and safe to perform via the endotracheal tube and high concentration oxygen can be administered quickly. Special attention should be paid to patients with bronchiectasis and chronic lung infections, as their respiratory function tends to be compromised owing to lung in /uniFB02 ammation and deformities caused by bronchiectasis and cavities.\nOverall, the current study /uniFB01 ndings do not support routine bronchoscopy prior to BAE in nonintubated patients with hemoptysis caused by bronchiectasis and chronic pulmonary infection. Bronchoscopy may be considered in patients whose bleeding side is dif /uniFB01 cult to determine using CT imaging due to equal severity of lung involvement in both lungs within 2 days after hemoptysis, with caution taken for respiratory status. As for bacteriologic evaluation, previously unknown organisms were detected in 5 of the 19 patients undergoing bronchoscopic sputum culture; however, such evaluations can be performed postoperatively when patients are more stable because they do not affect the acute hemostasis strategy.\nThe current study has some limitations. First, this was a retrospective and single-center study. Second, the indication and timing of bronchoscopy were not uniform. The decision on whether to perform a bronchoscopy was based on several factors, including the judgment of the attending physician, the physical status of the patient, and the patient ' s request. The utility of bronchoscopy might have been underestimated because the time from hemoptysis to bronchoscopy was longer than that of CT imaging. However, even if all 5 patients in Group C (those who underwent bronchoscopy > 2 days following hemoptysis but both bronchoscopy and CT imaging failed in lateralizing) had undergone earlier and successful bronchoscopy, the\npercentage of patients who did not require bronchoscopy for the planning of BAE would have been < 90% (84 of 93). In addition, a prospective study on this issue would be dif /uniFB01 cult to conduct because it is less feasible and ethical due to the risk of complications, as reported in the current study (19%). Third, this study did not determine the bene /uniFB01 ts or harms of bronchoscopy prior to BAE in the setting of other leading causes of hemoptysis such as lung cancer and cryptogenic hemoptysis. The conclusion of this study cannot be applied to such cases; bronchoscopic biopsy (histologic evaluation) is of relatively high importance in patients with lung cancer, especially when making decisions about chemotherapy, and bronchoscopy is generally required to rule out other causes of bleeding in patients with cryptogenic hemoptysis.",
