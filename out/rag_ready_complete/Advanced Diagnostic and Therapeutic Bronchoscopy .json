These represent additional work associated with a speci /uniFB01 c related primary procedure and cannot be billed independently. 2 The RVU process assigns a value relative to existing services and procedures. Value is calculated based on complexity of skill, risk, time, or other similar variables. Each year, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services assigns a dollar value (conversion factor) to 1 RVU nationally, which then is modi /uniFB01 ed by predetermined geographical adjustments. The conversion factor is multiplied by the assigned RVU or work RVU (wRVU), depending on the location of service, to determine the reimbursement. The wRVU refers to the physician work only and does not include other aspects, such as practice expense or malpractice costs included in the total RVU. Overlapping procedures can be subject to the multiple endoscopy or multiple procedure rules as described previously. 3,4\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services established the National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI) edits, which they revise quarterly. NCCI edits prospectively prevent improper payment when services have overlapping activity. NCCI edits impact\nprocedures or encounters that take place at the same time that include work common to both to prevent duplication of payment for overlap.

Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) typically consists of an electromagnetic /uniFB01 eld generator, planning software, an extended working channel and locatable guide, or sampling instruments. These are introduced through the bronchoscope. They are directed along a virtual airway map and tracked within the electromagnetic /uniFB01 eld in multiple planes. Sampling is carried out when the target is reached. Different system variations offer trackable biopsy instruments, digital tomosynthesis, robotic assistance, shape-sensing technology, and integration of augmented /uniFB02 uoroscopy for better localization of the targets. Diagnostic yields for ENB vary widely based on patient selection and diagnostic techniques. Studies have found yields as low as 38.5% for ENB alone and up to\n70.6% when used with RP-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS). 15,16 ENB has a low complication rate of pneumothorax (3.1%-4.9%), about half requiring drainage, 17,18 and bleeding (2.3%). 18 RPEBUS, upper- and middle-lobe lesions, and use of general anesthesia improve diagnostic yield. 17 CPT code 31627 is used when ENB or computer-assisted, image-guided navigation is performed and is listed in addition to other codes for the primary bronchoscopy procedure. 19",

This induces a photooxidative intracellular reaction involving reactive oxygen species with direct toxicity and indirect effects including ischemia and immune-in /uniFB02 ammatory effects that lead to cell death and necrosis. 39 Bronchoscopic PDT typically is used as a palliative measure or adjunctive therapy in cases of nonoperable malignant airway obstruction or other endoluminal lesions that are nonsevere or require emergency intervention.\nBronchoscopic PDT has several stages. First, photosensitizer, typically por /uniFB01 mer sodium, is administered intravenously at 2 mg/kg. 39,40 After infusion, a time delay allows the photosensitizer to be distributed and absorbed; 24 to 72 h for por /uniFB01 mer sodium. After this, bronchoscopy is performed to administer the light with a cylindrical diffuser at the matching wavelength (typically 630 nm). The diffuser is introduced via the working channel, positioned parallel to the target, and activated to deliver the desired energy (200 J/cm). Coding is based on activation time and is an add-on to the base bronchoscopy procedure (eg, CPT code 31641, described previously). For the /uniFB01 rst 30 min of activation, CPT code þ 96570 is used.

It involves placing one-way valves into the targeted diseased lobe, which allows for air and secretions to exit and achieve lobar atelectasis. 46,47 Presently, two types of valves are in use: Zephyr (Pulmonx, Inc.) and Spiration (Spiration, Inc.).\nBoth types involve a thorough preprocedural selection process to qualify for treatment. This includes analysis of a patient ' s pulmonary function, functional assessment, and high-resolution CT scanning to assess for collateral ventilation and /uniFB01 ssure completeness. For the Pulmonx system (Pulmonx, Inc.), the Chartis Pulmonary Assessment System is used to con /uniFB01 rm the lack of collateral ventilation before valve placement. 48,49 Adedicated balloon catheter is placed endoscopically into the targeted lobe to occlude the intended airway and monitor air /uniFB02 ow and pressure to assess the presence or absence of collateral ventilation. The Spiration system relies on degree of CT scan /uniFB01 ssure integrity to assess for lack of collateral ventilation. If minimal or no collateral ventilation is found in the targeted lobe, appropriately sized valves are placed. Once the targeted airway is in view, the dedicated catheter (with compressed valve at the distal aspect) is advanced into position in the bronchus. The valve is deployed and self-expands. Multiple valves typically are deployed based on the size of airway branches and how many are needed to block ventilation fully. Some maneuvering is available after being deployed; however, a valve cannot be reused or redeployed. Valve coding is based on lobes targeted regardless of the number of valves used.

      "content": "Table 3 provides the CPT code descriptors for tracheostomy procedures and their associated wRVUs. The CPT code for planned tracheostomy is 31600. Percutaneous tracheostomy is performed in the intubated and sedated or medically paralyzed patient. A needle and guidewire are inserted, typically under bronchoscopic guidance, at the desired entry point, and dilation is\n]\nperformed, followed by insertion of the tracheostomy tube. Clinical con /uniFB01 rmation is carried out, and the tube then is secured according to usual methods. 55 Additional details of this procedure are well described in an article by Singh and Sing. 56 All work is captured in CPT code 31600. If the operator performs other distinct bronchoscopy work, BAL or therapeutic aspiration, for example, these must be documented to clarify the medical necessity for these additional procedures with their distinct codes.\nA common coding question is whether a CPT code exists for tracheostomy tube change. Two different clinical scenarios apply. Tube change before establishment of a mature /uniFB01 stula tract is reported with CPT code 31502. No distinct code exists for routine tracheostomy tube change after the tract is established. Use evaluation and management coding as appropriate to the level of service provided (eg, CPT codes 99212-99215).",

      "title": "Transbronchial Cryobiopsy",
      "content": "Transbronchial cryobiopsy uses a gas-frozen catheter to extract an adherent biopsy specimen. It does not have a unique code to account for its complexity. An expert panel describes it as: ' Bronchoscopy, rigid or /uniFB02 exible, including /uniFB02 uoroscopic guidance, when performed; with transbronchial cryobiopsy. ' 57 However, this is not an adopted CPT description. It is more complicated than the\nstandard peripheral transbronchial lung biopsy commonly performed with moderate sedation. These procedures are always performed with general anesthesia with an endotracheal tube or rigid bronchoscopy on individuals with severe interstitial lung disease. The risk of major complications of bleeding or pneumothorax is up to 20%. A balloon occlusion device to provide tamponade after each pass is a required element of the procedure. Although this is fundamentally a different procedure with increased risk that requires greater skill than basic transbronchial biopsy, no separate code exists currently. As such, the coding is based on the standard transbronchial procedure in which several biopsy samples are obtained from segments within a single lobe (CPT code 31628) or possibly additional lobes (CPT code þ 31632), with the added use of balloon occlusion for tamponade (CPT code 31634). NCCI edit may prevent this combination, and unique payer policies may require the use of an unlisted procedure code (CPT code 32999). A 22 Modi /uniFB01 er that is used for extended work over a typical procedure may be added with clear documentation of the increased time and work. 1,7",

The range of procedures discussed may be performed as stand-alone procedures; however, they are performed more commonly with other complex or basic pulmonary procedures. With improved technology, ef /uniFB01 ciency, and ef /uniFB01 cacy of performing multiple procedures in the same setting, it becomes critical to understand thoroughly the clinical, coding, and /uniFB01 nancial implications of these procedures. Appropriately optimizing facility and physician reimbursement is integral to the adoption of advanced diagnostic and therapeutic bronchoscopy.",
