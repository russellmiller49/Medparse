Bronchoscopic valve placement constitutes an effective endoscopic lung volume reduction (ELVR) therapy in patients with severe emphysema and low collateral ventilation. After the most destroyed lobe is occluded with valves, signi /uniFB01 cant target lobe volume reduction leads to improvements in lung function, exercise capacity, and quality of life.

Consolidating LVRS by lobectomy after failure of a previously successful ELVR is feasible and results in signi /uniFB01 cant symptom relief and improvement of lung function.\n(Ann Thorac Surg 2021;111:1858-66) /C211 2021 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons\nC hronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) is a progressive, life-threatening syndrome characterized by chronic bronchitis and air /uniFB02 ow obstruction, leading to hyperin /uniFB02 ation and emphysematous lung destruction. Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) effectively reduces hyperin /uniFB02 ation by resecting destroyed emphysematous lung tissue. The immediate improvement in respiratory mechanics and ventilation leads to improved lung function, exercise tolerance, dyspnea relief, and long-term survival in carefully selected patients. 1-3 Although LVRS has been proven to be an\neffective treatment modality in appropriately selected patients, the procedure is relatively underused because of concerns about associated morbidity and narrow patient eligibility criteria. 4\nEndoscopic lung volume reduction (ELVR) aims at overcoming these limitations by providing the bene /uniFB01 ts seen with LVRS but reducing procedure-associated morbidity and mortality. Blocking methods, such as valve implantation, and nonblocking methods, such as\nAddress correspondence to Dr Eichhorn, Department of Thoracic Surgery, Thoraxklinik, Heidelberg University, R € ontgenstraße 1, 69126 Heidelberg, Germany; email: martin.eichhorn@med. uni-heidelberg.de.\nDr Gompelmann discloses a /uniFB01 nancial relationship with Pulmonx, Chiosi, AstraZeneca Berlin, Chemie, Grifols, Medical Uptake, Novartis, and Boehringer Ingelheim; Dr Kontogianni with Broncos; Dr Herth with Pulmonx; and Dr Eberhardt with Olympus, Pulmonx, and Broncos.\ncoil implants, are used to induce lung de /uniFB02 ation with the same goal of improving respiratory mechanics. Several randomized controlled trials have con /uniFB01 rmed ELVR ef /uniFB01 -cacy in improving lung function, exercise capacity, and quality of life in patients with severe emphysema by using intrabronchial (IBV) or endobronchial valves (EBV). 5-7\nThe most common complication observed after valve implantation is pneumothorax, which is seen in 18% to 30% of patients. 7-9 Further complications during longterm follow-up include exacerbation of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), distal valve pneumonia, hemoptysis due to granulation tissue formation, and valve displacement with reventilation of the atelectatic lobe and inconsistent therapeutic ef /uniFB01 -cacy. 9,10 Despite signi /uniFB01 cant initial improvements in lung function and exercise capacity, endoscopic therapy has to be terminated in this patient subpopulation. 10 The question, therefore, was whether additional LVRS therapy can be offered to these patients, in particular if they do not meet the standard eligibility criteria for LVRS due to lower-lobe emphysema.\nWe hypothesized that surgical lung volume reduction (LVRS) would reestablish ELVR short-term clinical improvements after ELVR long-term failure in a selected patient subpopulation with heterogeneous emphysema. Therefore, the present study retrospectively analyzed safety and clinical outcomes of patients initially treated by valve implantation with good clinical bene /uniFB01 t, followed by consolidating LVRS by lobectomy of the previously identi /uniFB01 ed target lobe.",

In cases of doubt, an endoscopic\nassessment of collateral ventilation was performed (Chartis Pulmonary Assessment System, Pulmonx Corp).\nAll selected patients underwent clinically meaningful target lobe volume reduction (TLVR) after complete occlusion of the treated lobe. The reduced target lobe volume was accompanied by clinically important improvements in lung function or exercise capacity, or both, in all patients. However, for different reasons, the effects of ELVR were not consistent in those patients. ELVR long-term failure was de /uniFB01 ned as a failure of ELVR therapy after an initial positive therapeutic effect that lasted for at least 3 months. In patients with inconsistent clinical bene /uniFB01 t after valve implantation, inadequacy of atelectasis was judged by roentgenogram or low-dose CT. Bronchoscopy was performed if valve dislocation was suspected. In addition, deterioration of lung function was assessed by body plethysmography.\nBefore each consolidating LVRS, each patient was discussed by an interdisciplinary emphysema board, and surgery was recommended only after a consensus decision. Maximal pharmacotherapy had to be exhausted. A pulmonary rehabilitation or an individual outpatient exercise program, or both, was required in all patients before ELVR or before consolidating LVRS. As a result of the documented positive effect of ELVR, selected patients were also eligible for surgery with a predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of less than 20% or diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) of less than 20%. A recent HRCT scan and perfusion scintigraphy before LVRS were necessary to identify possible contraindications and to con /uniFB01 rm the target lobe once more. The previously identi /uniFB01 ed target lobe was resected through a standard open anterolateral thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery.",

      "content": "This study investigated all patients with emphysema and severe hyperin /uniFB02 ation who underwent consolidating LVRS by lobectomy at our institution after ELVR treatment had failed. Here we report the feasibility and outcome of LVRS by lobectomy in patients who had previously been treated by ELVR. We were able to demonstrate that the surgical procedure was associated with acceptable risks in well-selected patients and led to signi /uniFB01 cant improvement in FEV1, decrease in hyperin/uniFB02 ation, and even improvement in exercise capacity.\nMore than 15 years ago, the National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT), the largest multicenter randomized trial on emphysema treatment, demonstrated that LVRS improves lung function, exercise capacity, and long-term survival in patients with upper lobe -predominant emphysema and low exercise capacity. 1,3 Therefore, in many centers, LVRS is considered as a therapeutic option only in this particular patient subgroup. 16 However, single-center studies have shown that these criteria can be extended with respect to comorbidities, such as pulmonary hypertension, 17 impaired diffusion capacity, 18 and nonheterogeneous emphysema distribution. 19 So far, only limited information is available concerning feasibility and outcomes if LVRS is performed in patients after ELVR treatment failure or in terms of combined ELVR and LVRS treatment.\nIn accordance with NETT criteria, FEV1 and DLCO values before surgery were above 20% predicted, and therefore, most patients did not meet the criteria of the NETT ' high-risk ' subgroup. 20 However, 90% of patients in the present investigation presented with lower lobe -predominant heterogeneous emphysema and, therefore, may not be considered ideal candidates for LVRS surgery, according to NETT criteria.\nMost of the published studies of high-volume centers report LVRS in upper lobe -predominant heterogeneous emphysema only. In a recent large, single-center analysis published by Ginsburg and colleagues, 21 91% of patients had upper lobe -predominant emphysema, and a further large retrospective analysis by Horwood and colleagues 22 reported the long-term outcome of 135 patients after LVRS, exclusively diagnosed with upper lobe -predominant emphysema.\nThe question, therefore, arises why a rather high proportion of patients (90%) were selected for lower-lobe LVRS in the present investigation. One possible explanation for this observation is a generally high rate of the lower lobe being targeted if ELVR is performed compared with LVRS. This was shown in several randomized controlled trials investigating the ef /uniFB01 cacy of ELVR\nData are presented as number (%) or mean /C6 SD.\nELVR, endoscopic lung volume reduction; LVRS, lung volume reduction surgery.\ntreatment, taking collateral ventilation into account: in the Endobronchial Valves for Emphysema without Interlobar Collateral Ventilation (STELVIO) trial, lower lobes were\ntargeted in 43.8% of cases, 23 in the Improving Patient Outcomes by Selective Implantation of the Zephyr EBV (IMPACT) study in 63%, 7 and in Trial of Endobronchial\na P < 0.05 vs pre-LVRS by Wilcoxon signed rank test.\nResults are given as mean /C6 SD pre-LVRS and 90 days post-LVRS in 19 patients with follow-up data.\nDLCO SB, single breath diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide; FEV1, forced expiratory volume in 1 second; LVRS, lung volume reduction surgery; mMRC, modi /uniFB01 ed Medical Research Council dyspnea questionnaire; NS, not signi /uniFB01 cant; RV, residual volume; TLC, total lung capacity; VC, vital capacity; 6MWD, 6-minute walking distance.\nValve Therapy vs. Standard of Care in Heterogeneous Emphysema (TRANSFORM) in 25%. 9\nThis rather high rate of endoscopic interventions targeting lower lobes cannot be explained by the distribution of heterogeneous emphysema but must be attributed to a patient selection bias. The selection bias may be explained by the following points: First, the /uniFB01 ssure is more often complete on the left side, and therefore, ELVR therapy is more likely to be effective on the left side compared with the right, if collateral ventilation is taken into consideration for adequate patient selection.\nSecond, the left lower lobe can be endoscopically reached straightforwardly and offers most suitable landing zones for effective valve placement on the segmental level. However, the lower lobe bronchi are softer and less rigid compared with the upper lobe bronchi and, therefore, valve dislocation might be more likely after lower lobe targeting. One could, therefore, hypothesize that ELVR treatment of lower lobes is associated with a higher rate of inconsistent therapeutic effects and long-term treatment failure, compared with upper lobe targeting.\nAccording to the responder analysis, more than twothirds of patients in the present cohort experienced bene /uniFB01 ts from consolidating LVRS in all pulmonary function\ntests and measures of exercise capacity. FEV1 was increased by 27% and RV was reduced by 1.3 L at 3 months postintervention. A recently published metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials investigating ELVR and LVRS therapy showed a mean increase in FEV1 of 15.9% and a mean reduction of residual volume by 0.58 L postintervention. 24 The pooled analysis revealed an improvement in 6MWD by 43 m, whereas consolidating LVRS in the present investigation improved 6MWD by 58 m. In their investigation of long-term survival and functional outcomes after lower-lobe LVRS, Perikleous and colleagues 25 showed an approximately equivalent increase in FEV1 and reduction in the RV/TLC ratio 3 months postsurgery compared with the results in the present study.\nIn summary, at least equivalent functional improvement was achieved by consolidating lung volume reduction by lobectomy compared with known functional improvements after ELVR therapy or primary LVRS by unilateral or bilateral upper lobe shaving. Our results reveal that LVRS can be performed successfully in patients with lower lobe emphysema. The outcome does not depend on the emphysema distribution to the upper lobes.\nInterestingly, the functional improvement after LVRS was equivalent to the temporarily improved lung function and exercise capacity after ELVR therapy. This can be explained by a comparable total lung volume reduction after both ELVR with complete atelectasis and LVRS by lobectomy. Therefore, ELVR therapy by valve implantation may be a useful procedure for predicting functional outcomes after LVRS. Consequently, this strategy will help to further improve patient selection for LVRS therapy, especially if patients do not ful /uniFB01 ll the classic NETT selection criteria, because only responders of lung volume reduction will be selected for surgical therapy. Patients who did not show any clinical improvement after ELVR therapy despite signi /uniFB01 cant target lobe volume reduction should not undergo consolidating LVRS.\nThe main limitations of this study are its retrospective design and lack of a control group to compare the natural course of best medical or interventional treatment. Moreover, the concept of consolidating LVRS is limited to a very small number of highly selected patients.\nWe therefore conclude that patient selection should be discussed by a multidisciplinary emphysema board and that the center should have extensive experience in both LVRS and ELVR when indications are extended beyond the classical guidelines and patients sequentially undergo both therapeutic modalities. Given the limited treatment options available for this particular patient population, consolidating LVRS can be considered as a promising treatment strategy in patients with\ninconsistent therapeutic effects or ELVR long-term failure.",

      "content": "Invited Commentary:\nIn this issue of The Annals of Thoracic Surgery , the study, titled ' Consolidating Lung Volume Reduction Surgery After Endoscopic Lung Volume Reduction Failure, ' is indeed, a unique article. 1 In almost all series that are published pertaining to lung volume reduction surgery for emphysema, there is a predominance of patients with upper-lobe disease. In fact, it is unusual for upper-lobe disease to not represent more than 90% of the series. In contradistinction, this report is focused on some patients with lower-lobe disease. Also, while generally the surgical approach to lung volume reduction surgery is a bilateral thoracoscopic approach, this group underwent\nunilateral open lobectomy. As the authors note, this is a highly selected group of patients, and of more than 600 patients who had some treatment for their emphysema, this study focused on only 19 patients. The study, itself, is entirely retrospective and without a control group.\nIt should be noted that they started with a fairly ideal group of patients, who had heterogeneous disease and were very hyperin /uniFB02 ated. The group ' s mean residual volume was 280%. One would expect excellent results with volume reduction, no matter what the form of treatment was, with this group.\nOverall, in their entire group of patients that they put bronchial valves in to treat emphysema, more than 50% were placed in the lower lobes. It seems like a",
