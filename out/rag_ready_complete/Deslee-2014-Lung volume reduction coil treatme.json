After that /uniFB01 rst trial we improved the LVR coil treatment to target the most diseased areas of the lung with approximately 10 coils placed per lobe, in order to maximise re-tensioning of the airway network. The results using this approach in 16 patients with upper lobe predominant heterogeneous emphysema have previously been published, showing feasibility and safety and also demonstrating statistically and clinically signi /uniFB01 cant improvements in pulmonary function, exercise capacity and quality of life. 10 Surprisingly, even in this early pilot phase, two-thirds of the patients treated responded beyond the minimal clinically important differences (MCID) for forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), 11 residual volume (RV), 12 6-min walk distance (6MWD) 13 and St George ' s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). 14\nFollowing the successful early experiences in these two pilot trials, the current study allowed further investigation into the feasibility , safety and ef /uniFB01 cacy of LVR coil treatment in a multicentre setting in a larger group of patients.",

Our results con /uniFB01 rm the acceptable safety pro /uniFB01 le for LVR coil treatment with a rate of adverse events similar to previous reports on L VR coil treatment. 10 19 The rate of post-procedure exacerbations and pneumonia is comparable to reported events with endobronchial one-way valves. 6 8 Importantly, the total rate of these Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-related events following endoscopic implants did not exceed the number of exacerbations and pneumonia that were reported in the EASE trial sham bronchoscopy control group. 20 LVR coil speci /uniFB01 c procedure-induced events that occur are typically very mild haemoptysis or coloured sputum requiring no intervention in about 50% of subjects and temporary chest discomfort for a few days requiring either a standard painkiller regimen for a few days or no intervention at all in about one-third of subjects treated.\nRegarding ef /uniFB01 cacy, our results show signi /uniFB01 cant improvements in clinical and functional parameters at 6 months with a magnitude of response in line with the two recent reports on L VR coil treatment, 10 19 reporting on 6- and 3-month follow-up, respectively . Our study provides the /uniFB01 rst longer-term analysis of data over 12 months after bilateral LVR coil treatment and demonstrates a sustained response at 12 months. To better analyse the relevance of the ef /uniFB01 cacy results, we analysed the MCID in\nFEV1, 11 RV , 12 6MWD 13 and SGRQ 14 and found a signi /uniFB01 cant responder rate at 6 and 12 months for these clinical endpoints (table 5).\nThe cohort trial design can, of course, induce bias. However, the results reported are higher than reported MCID for our endpoints and show similar ef /uniFB01 cacy across multiple centres. Furthermore, we have previously shown that, even in a shamcontrolled bronchoscopic interventional trial design, no real placebo effect could be observed in patients with severe Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 20\nTo better understand the predictors of response to L VR coil treatment, we conducted a multivariate analysis to assess the relationship between the response to treatment and baseline variables typically identi /uniFB01 ed as predictors of outcome, such as hyperin /uniFB02 ation and emphysema heterogeneity. Using the 6-month endpoints, none of the evaluated baseline variables provided a meaningful predictor of response to L VR coil treatment. Other potential variables could include nuanced emphysema phenotypes beyond heterogeneous or homogeneous classi /uniFB01 cation, such as more or less small airways disease, centrilobular versus panlobular emphysema and variability in placement strategies including proximal versus distal placement within the subsegmental airways and/or the number and size of coils deployed. The current active clinical trials (NCT01822795 21 and NCT01608490) and future meta-analysis data of patients treated in the four European clinical studies thus far may increase the statistical power suf /uniFB01 ciently to perform this analysis better. In our study, where broad selection criteria were purposely used in order to evaluate the effectiveness in a population of patients representative of the patients we see in daily practice, we found a large variability of response between patients. However, responder rates overall for several endpoints were already high (table 5).\nThe dif /uniFB01 culty of identifying strong predictors of success has been previously demonstrated by a predictive multivariate effort completed in a much larger patient cohort (n=608) for outcome after lung volume reduction surgery. In this large group, only a very weak signal for RV/TLC and emphysema distribution could be demonstrated. 22\nLung hyperin /uniFB02 ation is a major feature of emphysema and is associated with dyspnoea, exercise intolerance and compromised daily physical activity. 23 24 In this study, neither baseline RV nor RV/TLC predicted the response to LVR coil treatment. This is\nEfficacy at 6 months for all LVR coil treatments (n=58, overall group) and at 6 and 12 months (n=34, 12-month follow-up group columns). Results are given as change from baseline.

Results are given as percentage of responders to total patients.\n0699. Protected by copyright.\npossibly due to the fact that RV >175% pred was an inclusion criterion, resulting in treatment of severe static hyperin /uniFB02 ated patients (mean baseline RV 249.2±53.2% pred). On the other hand, the magnitude of change in RV after LVR coil treatment was associated with more favourable mean clinical and functional outcomes in this study, suggesting that RV changes may be viewed as a marker of response to treatment and that, by selecting patients with more potential for signi /uniFB01 cant RV decrease, the likelihood of signi /uniFB01 cant clinical bene /uniFB01 t may be increased. The /uniFB01 nding that RV is reduced by LVR coil treatment might be related to mechanical volume compression of lung tissue exerted by the coils, as well as improvement in elastic recoil achieved by decreasing airway resistance. 25\nWhen comparing the results for patients with upper lobe versus lower lobe treatment, no outcome differences were observed for RV , 6MWD and SGRQ. The lower FEV1 results seen with lower lobe coil treatments is comparable to the experience with lung volume reduction surgery in the lower lobes where the effect on improving FEV1 is also limited compared with other outcome variables. 26 However, because FEV1 in general shows poor correlation with performance in patients with severe emphysema, 27 and that patient-relevant outcomes such as 6MWD and SGRQ show strong improvement even in lower lobe subjects, lower lobe treatment with coils appears to be a clinically valid treatment option with clear patient bene /uniFB01 t. Future work will evaluate whether, as currently hypothesised, the much bigger lower lobes require a greater number of coils to optimise results.\nOur post hoc CT analysis showed that a large number of patients were classi /uniFB01 ed as homogeneous when using both a visual and a digital assessment, even though the inclusion criteria called for heterogeneous patients per clinicians ' visual assessment. This /uniFB01 nding should be cautiously considered, since this trial was not designed to prospectively identify homogeneous emphysema patients and the two methods of creating a heterogeneous versus a homogeneous group are arbitrary. Our results show that L VR coil treatment also bene /uniFB01 ts patients with less pronounced heterogeneous to homogeneous disease. Our data showed a statistically and clinically signi /uniFB01 cant bene /uniFB01 t for both groups compared with baseline, with overall a potentially increased mean ef /uniFB01 cacy for the heterogeneous patient group. The fact that L VR coil treatment also shows ef /uniFB01 cacy in patients with homogeneous emphysema is a very important /uniFB01 nding, challenging the assumption that only patients with heterogeneous emphysema will respond to LVR coil treatment, as has been shown for surgical lung volume reduction 28 and EBV . 6 7 Of note, other bronchoscopic techniques such as thermal\nvapour ablation 29 and sealant therapy 30 are also restricted to upper lobe predominant heterogeneous emphysema, leaving a broad group of patients with non-upper lobe predominant and homogeneous disease without a treatment option. It can be hypothesised that LVR coil treatment is similarly ef /uniFB01 cient in both heterogeneous and homogeneous emphysema because of a different mechanism of action from true ' lung volume reducing ' therapies, as the primary mechanism of action of coils appears to be mechanical re-tensioning of the airway network rather than just reducing absolute lung volume alone. However, additional studies are necessary to better characterise the mechanisms of action of coils and also to con /uniFB01 rm the ef /uniFB01 cacy of L VR coil treatment in homogeneous emphysema, which represents a large number of patients usually excluded from other surgical and bronchoscopic lung volume reduction treatment options.\nIn conclusion, this study provides multicentre evidence for the feasibility , procedural safety and ef /uniFB01 cacy of LVR coil treatment in patients with both heterogeneous and homogeneous emphysema. Further studies are underway to con /uniFB01 rm ef /uniFB01 cacy in long-term randomised trials. Additional studies are needed to improve the understanding of the predictive factors of response in order to better select the responders to L VR coil treatment.",
