(Gastrointest Endosc 2021;93:1077-85.)\n(footnotes appear on last page of article)\nGastrostomy tube placement is a common procedure for long-term enteral access in patients who are unable to maintain adequate volitional intake of food. 1 A gastrostomy procedure can be performed by 1 of 3 principal techniques: percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), typically performed by a gastroenterologist; /uniFB02 uoroscopyguided gastrostomy performed by an interventional radiologist (IR-gastrostomy); and open or laparoscopic gastrostomy performed by a surgeon (surgical gastrostomy). 2 Some centers consider PEG to be the initial intervention of choice, but IR-gastrostomy and surgical gastrostomy are also commonly performed, especially in patients who are unable to undergo PEG. 3-6\nGastrostomy creation is a high-risk procedure associated with risk of bleeding, aspiration, infection, perforation, and, rarely, death. 7,8 Furthermore, the procedure is often indicated and performed in older inpatients with multiple comorbidities who are vulnerable to adverse events. 9 Published studies have reported varying comparative rates of adverse events associated with various gastrostomy techniques. Some studies have demonstrated fewer major adverse events with IRgastrostomy compared with PEG, 10 whereas others have suggested that PEG is safer than IR-gastrostomy in select patients. 11 Still other studies have demonstrated no difference between the different techniques. 12-14 The available literature is often limited to single-center, retrospective studies with relatively small sample sizes and varying indications for the gastrostomy. 2,5,15 Hence, the optimal technique for gastrostomy remains to be de /uniFB01 ned, and the selection is often per the discretion of physicians\nKnowledge of associated adverse events and mortality for each technique is necessary to improve patient care. In this study, we analyzed the outcomes and adverse events associated with endoscopic, radiologic, and open surgical gastrostomy procedures using a large, nationwide readmission database.",

The ICD-10 codes 0DH68UZ and 0DH67UZ were excluded from the analysis because they refer to ' placement of a feeding device into the stomach through a (pre-existing) natural or arti /uniFB01 cial opening ' and convert to different ICD ninth revision codes that are inconsistent with creation of a gastrostomy.

      "content": "Gastrostomy creation is the most common intervention for long-term enteral access to facilitate a bolus feeding regimen. 9 A gastrostomy can also be used for multiple reasons other than nutrition, including retrograde intestinal access to the biliary system for facilitation of ERCP in surgically altered anatomy or other procedures. 9,20 Gastrostomy has evolved from an open surgical technique with high mortality to varying methodologies including endoscopic, /uniFB02 uoroscopic, and laparoscopic or open surgical methods. 21 Although many centers prefer PEG and IRgastrostomy over surgical gastrostomy because of lower morbidity, 22,23 the optimal and safest technique for performing a gastrostomy remains unclear. Although each method can technically create a gastrostomy, the safety pro /uniFB01 le of each technique needs to be assessed.\nThis study assessed the safety and outcomes of endoscopic, IR-guided, and surgical gastrostomy using a large, nationwide database of hospitalized patients. We report that PEG is associated with signi /uniFB01 cantly lower risks of adverse\nevents like hemorrhage, peristomal infections, and colon perforation compared with IR-gastrostomy and surgical gastrostomy. Further, the rates of adverse outcomes such as inpatient mortality, readmission, nonhome discharge, and inpatient mortality are signi /uniFB01 cantly lower with PEG.\nGrant et al 6 categorized mortality, perforation, hemorrhage, and peristomal infection as major gastrostomy-related adverse events, whereas adverse events requiring minimal intervention, such as tube dislodgement, were classi /uniFB01 ed as minor. In their prospective series of 172 patients, IR-gastrostomy was associated with a signi /uniFB01 cantly higher incidence of major and minor adverse events. Similar results were reported from a single-center study that demonstrated lower rates of major and minor adverse events with PEG compared with IR-gastrostomy. 24 However, other investigators have reported better safety with IR-gastrostomy compared with PEG. 25 Compared with open surgical gastrostomy, PEG reduces operative time and expense and requires a shorter recovery time. 26 The above studies have signi /uniFB01 cant limitations including small sample size, which precludes an adequately powered statistical analysis; risks of selection bias; restriction to speci /uniFB01 c indications; and often report data from single centers. 6,14,24,25,27 Our study, based on a large dataset, is able to overcome",

This could possibly re /uniFB02 ect the ability of endoscopists and surgeons to control local bleeding with easily available endoscopic or surgical tools. Indeed, among patients with hemorrhage after undergoing IR-gastrostomy, an upper endoscopy is often performed to localize and treat the bleeding site. 31\nThe most common adverse event of PEG reported in the literature is wound or peristomal infection. 7 The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy recommends administration of antibiotics at the time of PEG to reduce the risk of peristomal infections. Data from randomized controlled trials involving IR-gastrostomy 33 and PEG 34 suggest that administration of antibiotics reduces the risk of peristomal infections. However, some studies suggest that performing a transabdominal gastrostomy without traversing the tube through the oropharynx (ie, IRgastrostomy) has a lower risk of infections and obviates the need for antibiotics. 35 This study reported signi /uniFB01 cantly lower odds of infection with PEG compared with surgical or IR-gastrostomy.

Endoscopic techniques such as transillumination, /uniFB01 nger indentation, and the ' safe-tract ' method can reduce the risk of colonic injury during PEG placement. 39 IRgastrostomy uses imaging studies (US or CT) to assess for intervening viscera and often uses oral contrast administration to delineate the colon or outline gastric rugal folds during /uniFB02 uoroscopy. 37 However, other means of con /uniFB01 rming the absence of intervening viscera may be needed to further improve the safety of the procedure. Because of a lack of operative details and patient-speci /uniFB01 c information in the database, we were unable to explain the incidence of colon perforation among patients undergoing open gastrostomy.\nA salient outcome of the study is the lower adjusted odds of inpatient mortality with PEG compared with IRgastrostomy and surgical gastrostomy. A pooled analysis of randomized and nonrandomized trials of PEG and IRgastrostomy reported a signi /uniFB01 cantly lower 30-day mortality rate with PEG compared with IR-gastrostomy. 40 Investigators have posited multiple explanations for the lower mortality associated with PEG, including the use of antibiotics and the preferential use of PEG in patients without malignancies. 40 Notably, this study also reported lowers odds of nonelective readmission and non-home discharge after PEG compared with IR-gastrostomy. We posit that this difference may re /uniFB02 ect the lower incidence of infections, colon perforation, and bleeding in patients undergoing PEG.\nWe report that the most common adverse event of a gastrostomy, irrespective of technique, is malfunction or\nmechanical adverse event of the gastrostomy tube. This suggests that patients and caregivers should receive education and instructions regarding the management of gastrostomy tubes. 41 Use of multidisciplinary nutrition support teams may also result in reduced readmissions and improved clinical outcomes. 42\nThe strengths of the study include a nationally representative large sample size, incorporation of hospitals of varying sizes and location, and inclusion of patients with diverse insurance coverage. Further, the large sample size facilitates control of multiple confounding variables including the presence of comorbidities and age, which can impact outcomes and adverse events. The study is limited by its retrospective design, constraints of possible coding errors in an administrative database, and lack of patient-speci /uniFB01 c data and other pertinent information such as medications, laboratory values, and follow-up beyond 30 days. The analysis did not include outpatient procedures because the database is restricted to inpatients. Further, despite our efforts to statistically adjust for covariates, other confounding variables may not have been accounted for. For example, the Nationwide Readmissions Database does not provide information about the clinical status of the patient at the time of procedure, periprocedure use of antibiotics, information about the gastrostomy tube, or details of the surgical interventions. This study found that among hospitalized patients, IRgastrostomy is the most frequently performed technique. We speculate that this could re /uniFB02 ect a selection bias because the study did not include outpatients.\nIn conclusion, this study demonstrates that endoscopic gastrostomy is associated with a lower risk of adverse events including infection, signi /uniFB01 cant bleeding, perforation, need for readmission, and all-cause mortality compared with surgical or IR-gastrostomy. It may be prudent to consider PEG as a safe method for gastrostomy among inpatients who need long-term enteral access. Future prospective, multicenter, randomized trials are needed to explore causal relationships and investigate other associated factors to determine the optimal method of creation of a gastrostomy.",
