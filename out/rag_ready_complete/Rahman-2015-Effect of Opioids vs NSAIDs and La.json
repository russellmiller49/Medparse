DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A 2×2 factorial phase 3 randomized clinical trial among 320 patients requiring pleurodesis in 16 UK hospitals from 2007 to 2013. INTERVENTIONS Patients undergoing thoracoscopy (n = 206; clinical decision if biopsy was required) received a 24F chest tube and were randomized to receive opiates (n = 103) vs NSAIDs (n = 103), and those not undergoing thoracoscopy (n = 114) were randomized to 1 of 4 groups (24F chest tube and opioids [n = 28]; 24F chest tube and NSAIDs [n = 29]; 12F chest tube and opioids [n = 29]; or 12F chest tube and NSAIDs [n = 28]). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Pain while chest tube was in place (0- to 100-mm visual analog scale [VAS] 4 times/d; superiority comparison) and pleurodesis efficacy at 3 months (failure defined as need for further pleural intervention; noninferiority comparison; margin, 15%).\nRESULTS Pain scores in the opiate group (n = 150) vs the NSAID group (n = 144) were not significantly different (mean VAS score, 23.8 mm vs 22.1 mm; adjusted difference, −1.5 mm; 95% CI, −5.0 to 2.0 mm; P = .40), but the NSAID group required more rescue analgesia (26.3% vs 38.1%; rate ratio, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.3-3.4; P = .003). Pleurodesis failure occurred in 30 patients (20%) in the opiate group and 33 (23%) in the NSAID group, meeting criteria for noninferiority (difference, −3%; 1-sided 95% CI, −10% to ; P = .004 for noninferiority). Pain scores were lower among patients in the 12F chest tube group (n = 54) vs the 24F group (n = 56) (mean VAS score, 22.0 mm vs 26.8 mm; adjusted difference, −6.0 mm; 95% CI, −11.7 to −0.2 mm; P = .04) and 12F chest tubes vs 24F chest tubes were associated with higher pleurodesis failure (30% vs 24%), failing to meet noninferiority criteria (difference, −6%; 1-sided 95% CI, −20% to ; P = .14 for noninferiority). Complications during chest tube insertion occurred more commonly with 12F tubes (14% vs 24%; odds ratio, 1.91; P = .20).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Use of NSAIDs vs opiates resulted in no significant difference in pain scores but was associated with more rescue medication. NSAID use resulted in noninferior rates of pleurodesis efficacy at 3 months. Placement of 12F chest tubes vs 24F chest tubes was associated with a statistically significant but clinically modest reduction in pain but failed to meet noninferiority criteria for pleurodesis efficacy.",

      "content": "(Reprinted)\nT he incidence of malignant pleural effusion is estimated to be 150 000 new cases in the United States each year. 1,2 To prevent symptoms of breathlessness and chest pain, removal of pleural fluid by thoracocentesis and subsequent pleurodesis is advocated in evidence-based national guidelines such as the 2010 British Thoracic Society guideline, 2,3 with talc being most effective in randomized trials. 3,4\nPleurodesisandchesttubeinsertionarepainful. 5-8 Mostphysicians use opiates, 8 despite nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) being effective in randomized trials of other causes of acute pain, 9 with which pleurodesis pain is probably comparable. Avoidance of NSAIDs in pleurodesis relates to concerns that these drugs may impair long-term fluid control by suppressing acute inflammation caused by pleurodesis agents. An evidence synthesis addressing this question 10 identified only 3 reports, all of which were animal models of pleurodesis. There are no prospective studies of NSAIDs in pleurodesis in humans, with only supportive data available from retrospective analysis of pneumothorax pleurodesis. 11\nThe optimal chest tube size for pleurodesis has not been identified. The British Thoracic Society guideline 3 advocates use of smaller tubes and cites an overall success rate for talc pleurodesis of 60% to 90%, with 7 of 15 studies cited using large (20-28 French [F]) tubes. Evidence suggesting that smaller tubes (<16F) are successful in pleurodesis comes from case series 3 and from 3 comparative studies, 12-14 of which only 1 was randomized, 13 and it was not designed to address pleurodesis noninferiority. In addition, smaller tubes may be less safe, with 1 observational study reporting a higher complication rate. 15\nThis pragmatic trial was designed to assess (1) the effect of NSAIDs compared with opiates in treatment of pleurodesis pain(superiority)andpleurodesisefficacy(noninferiority),and (2) the effect of small (12F) chest tubes compared with larger (24F) chest tubes on pain (superiority) and pleurodesis success (noninferiority) in a 2×2 factorial, randomized controlled design.",

The published minimum clinically significant threshold for a 100-mm VAS pain score is 13 mm (95% CI, 10-16 mm). 17 A mean pain score was calculated using all VAS measurements from randomization until tube removal. Patients were permitted rescue medication as needed and completed an extra VAS assessment prior to taking any rescue medication; this was accounted for in the analysis by assuming that the 'rescue' VAS measurement would have continued until the next scheduled VAS assessment. Visual analog scale scores were measured by 2 independent observers blinded to treatment group, with a protocol for resolving discrepant scores.\nPleurodesis Failure at 3 Months | Patients were classified as having pleurodesis failure if they required a further pleural intervention for relief of breathlessness on the same side as the pleurodesis in the 3 months after randomization. To reduce bias, the trial protocol allowed those with symptoms and a chest radiograph demonstrating 50% or more of the hemithorax occupied by fluid to have a further pleural intervention. Patients with symptoms and less than 50% of hemithorax occupied by fluid were referred for further pleural intervention only if the attending clinician discussed the case with a second clinician blinded to treatment group and consensus was reached regarding further treatment.",

The average pain score was analyzed using a mixed-effects linear regression model with adjustment for minimization variables (histological tissue type, thoracoscopic procedure, and center). The absolute difference in the proportion of patients who had pleurodesis failure was calculated using a generalized linear model with a binomial family and identity link. Because of potential overstratification, minimization variables were not adjusted for. 19 Sensitivity analyses of the primary outcome were performed to test the robustness of the results, not accounting for rescue medication (pain), logistic regression and competing risks (pleurodesis failure), and with respect to missing data under a number of data 'missing not at random' assumptions (Supplement 3).

The difference in pain scores remained when analysis was repeated not accounting for\nuse of rescue medication (mean VAS score for 12F tubes, 21.3 mm [SD, 15.8 mm]); for 24F tubes, 25.8 mm [SD, 16.9 mm]; adjusted difference in means, -5.6 mm; 95% CI, -11.2 to 0.02 mm; P = .05).\nIn the ITT analysis for pleurodesis failure at 3 months, NSAIDs met prespecified criteria for noninferiority because the lower bound of the 1-sided 95% confidence interval did not cross the 15% margin (failure rate: opiates, 30/150 (20.0%); NSAIDs, 33/144 (22.9%); difference, -3%; 95% CI, -10% to ∞ ). Smaller chest tubes had a higher failure rate (24F tubes, 12/50 [24.0%]; 12F tubes, 15/50 [30.0%]; difference, -6%; 95% CI, -20% to ∞ ) (Table 2 and Figure 2 ), failing to meet the 15% margin of noninferiority. The more stringent 97.5% confidence interval for pleurodesis failure gave similar results (Table 2). Including all patients (with and without thoracoscopy; preplanned secondary analysis) comparing tube size for pleurodesis failure, there remained an increased rate of pleurodesis failure using smaller tubes (failure rate: 24F tubes, 48/244 [19.7%]; 12F tubes, 15/50 [30.0%]; difference, -10%; 95% CI, -21% to ∞ ). The per-protocol analyses demonstrated similar results for pleurodesis failure (Figure 2 and eAppendix 8 in Supplement 1).\nDetails of howpatientsmetthecriteriaforpleurodesisfailure are given in eAppendix 9 in Supplement 1.",

      "content": "This trial is the largest study to our knowledge to specifically address analgesia and tube size for malignant pleural effusion pleurodesis in terms of pain experienced and pleurodesis success. The results challenge a number of assumptions about the optimal chest tube size and analgesic strategy for malignant pleural effusion pleurodesis and, by implication, current evidence-based guidelines such as the British Thoracic Society guideline, undertaken using SIGN methods. 3\nThis study demonstrated that NSAIDs are not superior to opiates in the management of pain after tube insertion\nand pleurodesis. However, given in high doses for a short period, NSAIDs given after talc pleurodesis were safe, effective, and not inferior in terms of pleurodesis efficacy. Although NSAID use was associated with increased use of rescue medication compared with an opiate-based strategy in 12% of patients requiring a small number of doses, the resultant pain experienced was not significantly different between opiate-treated and NSAID-treated patients. The increased requirement for rescue analgesia in the NSAID group may be a result of these drugs providing less pain relief than opiates. However, the finding of the same mean pain scores in the opiate and NSAID groups, whether rescue analgesia was accounted for or not, may reflect the unblinded nature of the trial, with the potential for NSAIDtreated patients to have had a greater perception of the need for rescue analgesia. These data suggest that NSAIDs can be used in patients undergoing pleurodesis if required. Also, in this study, despite the mean age of 71 years among participants, short-term use of high-dose NSAIDs was not associated with significant renal impairment or gastrointestinal adverse effects.\nThis trial also demonstrates that smaller (12F) chest tubes are associated with less pain than larger (24F) tubes. Although this difference was statistically significant and consistent (whether rescue analgesia was accounted for or not), the absolute difference in pain scores between smaller and larger tubes on average was small (6 mm) and was below the published minimum clinically significant threshold for a 100-mm VAS pain score (13 mm; 95% CI, 10-16 mm). 17 Thus, thereisrelativelylittle clinical benefit in terms of less pain from use of smaller chest tubes for malignant pleural effusion pleurodesis.\nHowever, the results of this trial also demonstrate that smaller chest tubes may be inferior to larger chest tubes in terms of pleurodesis success, given a 15% margin of noninferiority. Although many previous case series and small\nFigure 4. Time to Pleurodesis Failure Between Randomization and 6 Months by Tube Size and Analgesia Strategy, Censored for Loss to Follow-up and Death\nNSAIDs indicates nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.\na By Cox regression analysis.\n(Reprinted)\ncomparative studies have suggested that smaller chest tubes are 'as good as' larger ones for malignant effusion pleurodesis, 2,3 this is the first randomized study to our knowledge to specifically address this question using a noninferiority design. As a consequence of including thoracoscopy cases, for which only large-bore tubes are used, numbers of patients in the direct comparison of small-bore and large-bore tubes was limited; however, in this comparison, small tubes failed to meet noninferiority criteria, although this study was underpowered for this outcome because of the high number of patients undergoing thoracoscopies recruited to the study. On the basis of these data, performing a pleurodesis using a small tube according to current national guidelines 2,3 may reduce the likelihood of pleurodesis success compared with larger-bore tubes. Fur-\nthermore, larger direct comparison studies of small- and large-bore chest tubes are now required, but the current study poses important questions as to whether small-bore chest tubes are truly as efficacious as large-bore tubes for malignant pleural effusion pleurodesis.\nThe potential reasons for the 6% observed decrease in successful pleurodesis may include incomplete drainage; an increased unintentional displacement rate, thereby preventing adequate drainage after pleurodesis; and an increase in the frequency of patients unable to receive talc intrapleurally because of blockage of smaller tubes. Our data demonstrate that patients treated with smaller tubes were able to receive talc less often (80% vs 93%) and had a higher frequency of unintentional displacement of the chest tube (42% vs 28%).

Randomization in this study was minimized by thoracoscopic procedure, ensuring that pre hoc subgroup analysis was feasible. There was no evidence of an advantage to thoracoscopically delivered talc, although this was not a primary randomized study assessing this treatment mode, and ongoing trials should provide valuable information on this aspect of care. 21\nLargertubeswereassociatedwithsignificantlymorepain; whether this is related to the size of the traumatic injury required for chest tube insertion or related to insertion technique is not clear from our data. As all larger tubes were inserted using the blunt dissection technique and all smaller tubes inserted using the guide-wire technique, we were unable to address this issue. Whether using the guide-wire technique reduces pain but allows safer insertion of larger tubes requires further investigation.\nThere are important limitations to this study. First, this trial was not clinician- and patient-blinded, using 'masked' drains and a double-dummy, double-placebo analgesic design, and this may have introduced bias in the assessment of pain. Second, as a consequence of recruiting patients undergoing thoracoscopy (in whom only a large-bore tube can be used), the number of patients in the primary comparison of chest tube size for pleurodesis efficacy was limited. Thus, it is likely that this analysis is underpowered, but it remains the largest study to directly address this question. Third, the power calculation for pain was based on a nonpleurodesis model of acute pain using similar assessment methods 18 ; data on the pain caused by pleurodesis using these methods were not available during trial planning, and\nthis limitation does not affect the validity of comparative treatment analyses for this study. Fourth, the noninferiority margin of 15% was based on a survey of clinical expert opinion rather than on empirical data, which were not available at the time of trial planning.\nOnthebasisofthisrandomizedtrial, what should now be the recommendedmethodoftalcpleurodesis?Thereappears to be no advantage to NSAID-based analgesia but no reason to avoiduseofthesedrugsforpostpleurodesispain.Thus,forpatients at risk of opiate toxicity, NSAID-based analgesia is a reasonable treatment alternative with evidence of noninferior pleurodesis efficacy but modest increased use of rescue analgesia.Thereisnowanargumentfortheuseoflarge-borechest tubes for malignant pleural effusion pleurodesis on the basis of data from this trial. Although larger tubes were associated with more pain than smaller tubes, this was not clinically significant, and it cannot now be assumed that 12F tubes are as effective as 24F tubes in providing long-term fluid control after pleurodesis, which is the treatment intent. It appears that there are no clinically significant advantages of use of smaller tubes for malignant pleural effusion pleurodesis and the potential to reduce pleurodesis success, despite their current widespread use and the recommendations in national guidelines.
