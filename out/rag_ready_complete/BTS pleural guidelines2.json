    "abstract": "This guideline synthesizes contemporary, GRADE-based recommendations across four domains—spontaneous pneumothorax, undiagnosed unilateral pleural effusion, pleural infection, and pleural malignancy—reflecting major evidence shifts since 2010. It details diagnostic pathways (e.g., mandatory image-guided thoracentesis; optimized pleural fluid sampling volumes) and treatment algorithms (e.g., small-bore drainage first-line in pleural infection, tPA+DNase for residual collections). For malignant pleural effusion, it advises not postponing definitive pleural intervention until after systemic therapy and offers either IPC or pleurodesis when lung is expandable; imaging recommendations clarify the complementary roles of ultrasound and CT. Keywords: pleural effusion, pneumothorax, pleural infection, malignant pleural effusion, GRADE, guideline.",

Since  the  last BTS Guideline for pleural  disease  published  in 2010, 3-9 many high quality and practice changing studies,  using  patient  centred  outcomes,  have been published. The paradigms for the investigation and management of pleural disease have therefore  shifted,  so  this  guideline  aimed  to capture  this  evidence  and  use  it  to  answer  the most  important  questions  relevant  to  today's practice.",

The index test and reference standard (for diagnostic  accuracy  questions),  the  intervention  and  comparator  (for intervention questions), or the exposure and referent (for prognostic questions).\niii. The study type(s) defined in the clinical question protocol; and\niv. The clinical question outcome(s).\nEach  full  paper  fulfilling  the  above  criteria  was  'accepted' for  inclusion.  In  circumstances  where  there  was  little,  or  no supporting  evidence  that  fulfilled  the  above  criteria,  the  full paper inclusion strategy was widened to include evidence that partially addressed the clinical question.\nFollowing  data  extraction  from  the  'accepted'  papers, evidence  profiles  were  generated  for  each  of  the  clinical questions and the quality of the evidence was assessed using the  GRADE  principles. 12 Where  GRADE  analysis  was  not possible, but the evidence was deemed important enough to be  included  in  the  guideline,  the  evidence  has  been  listed as  (Ungraded),  denoting  that  inclusion  was  reached  by consensus of the guideline development group. A definition of the GRADE scores is shown in table 1.\nThe direction and strength of the recommendations are then based on the quality of the evidence, the balance of desirable and undesirable outcomes and the values and preferences of patients/ carers. GRADE specifies two categories of strength for a recommendation as shown in table 2.\nFrom the outset, it was acknowledged that there would be little high-  quality evidence for some of the clinical questions identified. In this instance, low grade evidence was considered, along with the expert opinion of the GDG via consensus at the meetings.\nGood practice points (GPPs) were also developed by informal consensus in areas where there was no quality evidence, but the GDG felt that some guidance, based on the clinical experience of the GDG, might be helpful to the reader. These are indicated as shown below:\n✓ Advised best practice based on the clinical experience of the GDG.\nIn  some  instances  where  evidence  was  limited,  but  GDG members felt that it was important to include a recommendation rather than a GPP , recommendations were agreed by informal consensus  and  categorised  as  (Conditional  -  by  consensus), based on the same criteria detailed in table 1.",
