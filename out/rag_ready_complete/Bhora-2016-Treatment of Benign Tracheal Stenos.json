Common causes include stenosis secondary to neoplasms, airway trauma (tracheal intubation, prior tracheotomy), collagen vascular diseases (granulomatosis with polyangiitis [GPA], sarcoidosis, and lupus), infectious diseases (tuberculosis), and idiopathic strictures. 1-3 The disease has a high rate of recurrence, and patients often require repeat interventions to maintain airway patency.\nSurgical resection with end-to-endanastomosishastherapeutic value in selected patients 4 ; however, as good outcomes have been seen with endoluminal therapies, the paradigmhasbeenshifting toward the latter. When open repair is not possible, that is, in patients with long strictures, diffuse inflammatory disorders, and the presence of severe comorbidities, endoluminal therapies can be used to improve airway patency and avoid tracheotomy. 5 Several thermal modalities have been used, such as laser photocoagulation, electrocautery, and photodynamictherapy,andtheseareusually combined with mechanical dilation using balloon or rigid dilators. 6,7 While effective in many cases, results are inconsistent and there is a concern that heat-based modalities may result in additional scar tissue formation and therefore lead to recurrence. 5 Similarly, airway stents are useful in some situations but are often complicated by formation of granulation tissue, mucusplugging,stentmigration,andoccasionallystent fracture in the case of metallic stents. 8,9 Giventhelimitations of current modalities for the treatment of benign tracheal stenosis, there exists a need to explore alternative methods.\nTheconceptofcryosurgery for laryngotracheal strictures datesbacktothelate20thcenturywiththeworkbyStrome 10,11 and others. Contact probe cryotherapy as a nonthermal modality was first used in the human trachea in 1986 to relieve symptoms associated with advanced carcinoma. 12 Advances have been made in the delivery system of this technology in the form of spray cryotherapy (SCT), is which liquid nitrogen is delivered through a 7F disposable catheter, causing tissue ablation by flash freezing. 13 Theuseofthismodality has been reported for ablation of esophageal lesions with good longterm outcomes. 14 Therefore, some centers already using SCT for gastrointestinal procedures investigated this modality for ablation of airway strictures. 15 The initial multicenter study evaluating the role of SCT in malignant airway obstruction reportedsubstantialcomplications. 16 It is thoughtthatthesecomplications were the result of insufficient egress of the nitrogengasthatformsasaresultoflarge-volumeexpansionduring thephasetransformationofliquidnitrogen.Incontrasttogastrointestinal procedures in which this evacuation can be achieved with active suctioning, an additional catheter is not practical in the airway and passive venting of the nitrogen gas remains the only option for adequate egress. 17,18\nIn 2012, the advanced truFreeze device was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for cryogenic destruction of tissue using liquid nitrogen spray requiring either active or passive ventilation during surgical procedures. 19 Hence, the use of this device in the airway is now considered on-label. Browning et al 20 in their recent experience have shown safety of this device in the management of neoplasm-\nrelated strictures and did not experience any of the complications reported by Finley and colleagues. 16 In this study, we report our initial results for the use of SCT as an adjunct to balloon dilatation in a cohort of patients with benign tracheal stenosis using the new truFreeze system.",

      "content": "Spray cryotherapy has evolved from contact cryoprobes that have been used in the aerodigestive tract for more than a decade. In contact cryotherapy, 7,21 nitrogen gas is released from thetipofaprobeandasitexpands,thetemperatureisbrought downto-40°CbytheJoule-Thomsoneffect. This is followed byformationofextracellularicecrystals,dehydration,andtissue necrosis. The tissue response from this cold injury ranges frominflammation to total destruction, depending on the severity of freezing. Unlike the cryoprobe, SCT uses a noncontact spray of liquid nitrogen at -196°C, causing flash freezing and intracellular crystal formation. With the onset of ice formation, water is extracted from within the cells, followed by cell shrinkage and damage to the intracellular matrix due to high salt content. As the temperature approaches -15°C and below, lethal intracellular ice begins to form. In a structurally constrained space, the expanding ice front may destroy cells of the capillary endothelial lining, rendering the vascular tree impaired after thawing and imparting its hemostatic properties. 22 With SCT tissue destruction is associated with preservation of extracellular matrix and regenerative growth of the tissue, which may allow healing with decreased or minimal fibrosis. 13,23 The major benefits of cryotherapy in neoplasm-related strictures appear to be its dual antiproliferative and hemostatic properties. When applied to benign strictures, it may cause 'remodeling' of the connective tis-\nsue matrix, which makes it more malleable and allows easier andmoreatraumaticdilationofthestricture. 24,25 However,the exact mechanism is less clear and additional research is required to enhance our understanding of the pathophysiologic mechanism of this modality.\nUse of SCT in patients with airway stenosis is fairly recent. Krimsky et al 15 evaluated the feasibility of SCT in 21 patients with lung cancer and reported regeneration of histologically normal epithelium with its use. Another multicenterstudy 16 describedtheuseofSCTin80patientswithneoplasm-related strictures. They reported improved luminal patency in all but 1 patient. However, substantial complications were observed including 21 (26%) intraoperative events (hypotension,bradycardia,tachycardia,ST-segmentchanges, anddesaturation),3pneumothoraces,and2intraoperativeand 3postoperativedeaths.Thisstudyraisedconcernsforthesafety ofSCTintheairway.Inaddition,aclinicaltrial(NCT00747461) was initiated in 2008 to investigate its role in benign airway disease. According to company records (CSA Medical), this trial was undertaken using the previous-generation device (CSAM2). Serious adverse effects were noted in the first accruals, and the trial was therefore terminated prematurely. Several modifications were made in the delivery and flow characteristics of the device. The new truFreeze system was released in 2012 and received expanded clearance from the FoodandDrugAdministrationincludingcryogenicdestruction of tissue necessitating active and passive ventilation. A recent studyinvestigated the safety of this device in 27 patients with malignantairwaystrictures and observed 3 complications (all transient hypoxia) in 80 procedures. 20 Theauthorsconcluded that SCTcanbesafelyusedintheairwaybyensuringadequate passive venting and allowing for adequate oxygenation between spray applications.

Important safety measures need to be carried out with the use of SCT due to rapid expansion of nitrogen gas and potential risk of barotrauma. 17 Ourrecordofsafetyisattributable to use of a team approach (including a thoracic surgeon [F.Y.B.], an otolaryngologist [R.S.L.], and an experienced anesthetist), meticulous attention to egress, and enhancements in the flow characteristics of the new cryospray system.
