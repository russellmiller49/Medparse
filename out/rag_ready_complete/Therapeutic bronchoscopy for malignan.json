    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: There is significant variation between physicians in terms of how they perform therapeutic bronchoscopy, but there are few data on whether these differences impact effectiveness.\nMETHODS: This was a multicenter registry study of patients undergoing therapeutic bronchoscopy for malignant central airway obstruction. The primary outcome was technical success, defined as reopening the airway lumen to . 50% of normal. Secondary outcomes were dyspnea as measured by the Borg score and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) as measured by the SF-6D.\nRESULTS: Fifteen centers performed 1,115 procedures on 947 patients. Technical success was achieved in 93% of procedures. Center success rates ranged from 90% to 98% (P 5 .02). Endobronchial obstruction and stent placement were associated with success, whereas American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score . 3, renal failure, primary lung cancer, left mainstem disease, and tracheoesophageal fistula were associated with failure. Clinically significant improvements in dyspnea occurred in 90 of 187 patients measured (48%). Greater baseline dyspnea was associated with greater improvements in dyspnea, whereas smoking, having multiple cancers, and lobar obstruction were associated with smaller improvements. Clinically significant improvements in HRQOL occurred in 76 of 183 patients measured (42%). Greater baseline dyspnea was associated with greater improvements in HRQOL, and lobar obstruction was associated with smaller improvements.\nCONCLUSIONS: Technical success rates were high overall, with the highest success rates associated with stent placement and endobronchial obstruction. Therapeutic bronchoscopy should not be withheld from patients based solely on an assessment of risk, since patients with the most dyspnea and lowest functional status benefitted the most.

Ablative techniques that destroy tissue are useful for endobronchial obstruction. Ablative techniques include lasers, electrocautery, argon plasma coagulation (APC), photodynamic therapy, microdebriders, and cryotherapy. Stents are the primary modality used for patients with extrinsic compression. For mixed patterns, multiple modalities are usually required. Practice patterns vary signifi  cantly between bronchoscopists in terms of the type of bronchoscopy used (fl  exible vs rigid), ablative technique preferred (eg, laser vs electrocautery), and stent strategy and preference (eg, silicone vs metal). Whether these practice variations impact eff  ectiveness is unknown.\nPrior studies of therapeutic bronchoscopy for central airway obstruction 2-6  have included both malignant and benign cases, and most were done retrospectively. However, outcomes and complications diff  er signifi  cantly depending upon the indication (eg, malignant airway obstruction vs postintubation tracheal stenosis). In many studies there was signifi  cant heterogeneity in terms of patient population and indications. 1,3,4  Other studies have focused on individual technologies, such as microdebriders  3  or APC. 7  Th ese studies are useful for evaluating new technologies, but they are not designed\nto show comparative eff  ectiveness. In clinical practice, a multimodality approach using a variety of technologies is the norm, but there is relatively scant evidence comparing techniques. In addition, the impact of interventions on quality of life has not always been quantifi  ed with validated instruments. Th is makes clinical decisionmaking more diffi cult, since physicians must be able to quantify the potential benefi  ts and weigh them against the risks. Finally, most of these studies were performed at centers of excellence as part of clinical research studies and used relatively small and highly selected patient populations. Whether these results can be generalized to everyday clinical practice is unknown.  8,9\nWe used the American College of Chest Physicians Quality Improvement Registry, Evaluation, and Education (AQuIRE) program to evaluate therapeutic bronchoscopy for malignant central airway obstruction. Registries off  er the benefi  t of providing clinical eff  ectiveness data that are more generalizable than those obtained from more focused clinical trials. 8,9  Our primary objective was to quantify the technical success rate of therapeutic bronchoscopy, defi  ned as anatomic reopening of the airways, and to identify techniques and factors associated with technical success. Secondary objectives were to assess the impact of therapeutic bronchoscopy on dyspnea and changes in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in a subset of these patients.

Technical success was based on anatomic criteria and was defi  ned bronchoscopically as reopening the airway lumen to . 50% of the normal diameter. Th e airway also had to connect to a viable area of distal lung. If a physician successfully reopened a proximal airway, only to discover that there was distal disease that occluded all the segmental and subsegmental levels, this was classifi  ed as a technical failure. All clinical outcomes were assessed by the attending physician using standardized defi  nitions from a code book. See   e-Appendix 1 for additional details on defi  nitions. Center volume was determined by calculating the average number of cases per month for each center, and this was used as a center-level variable in hierarchical models. A subset of centers agreed prospectively to collect preprocedure and 30-day postprocedure data on dyspnea and self-reported HRQOL. Dyspnea was measured using the Borg score, and HRQOL was measured using the SF  -6D.  12 Th e SF-6D provides a means to estimate a preference-based single index measure for health using general population data.\nTh e primary outcome was technical success of the procedure. All centers decided in advance whether to collect additional data on dyspnea and  HRQOL,  since  this  was  an  optional  module  within  AQuIRE because most centers do not collect these data as part of their routine clinical care. A secondary analysis was conducted to analyze the outcomes of change in dyspnea as measured by the Borg score and changes in  utility  as  derived  from  the  SF-6D,  only  using  the  data  from  those centers that agreed in advance to participate in that module.",

      "content": "Th erapeutic bronchoscopy for malignant central airway obstruction is essentially a palliative intervention, since most patients have advanced disease that is incurable. Although therapeutic bronchoscopy in this setting may indeed prolong life modestly for some patients (eg, enable them to get off   the ventilator), the majority of patients benefi  t from changes in quality of life rather than duration. When comparing the eff  ectiveness of various ther-\napeutic bronchoscopy techniques, it is therefore important to consider technical success and the subsequent impact on dyspnea and HRQOL. Th e potential benefi  ts in HRQOL must then be weighed against the risks associated with the intervention. In this study, we found that although there were signifi  cant diff  erences in technique between centers, technical success was usually achieved. Th ere were diff  erences between centers in the rate of technical success, but these were relatively modest. However, technical success did not always result in a meaningful improvement in dyspnea. Patients who were more short of breath at baseline were more likely to experience improvements in dyspnea, whereas those with lobar disease were less likely to improve. Similarly, HRQOL improvements were greatest in patients with more dyspnea at baseline, whereas those with lobar disease were less likely to improve. HRQOL improvement was also associated with higher ASA score and lower functional status. Th us, patients at the highest risk for complications also had the greatest potential for benefi  t.\nOur study is consistent with and adds to the existing body of evidence by comparing alternative technologies and quantifying the nature and magnitude of the benefi  ts of therapeutic bronchoscopy more precisely. 1,2,4,5,17-24 Prior studies oft  en involved single centers and focused on particular technologies. Because of this, the populations were highly selected and not large enough to compare alternative approaches. Consistent with prior studies, we found a high rate of technical success (93%) with a modest amount of variation in success rates between centers. In addition, because of the number of centers and physicians involved, we were able to compare alternative techniques. We found there was no single best method in terms of ablative techniques. In addition, we found that stenting was associated with higher technical success rates. Th is association is not necessarily causal, since some patients may prove to have extensive disease beyond the central airways, such that the physician may deem that stenting is of no benefi  t. Hence there may be confounding by indication present, so caution is warranted when analyzing the factors associated with technical success.\nHowever, measuring technical success alone is not suffi -cient, since palliation of dyspnea and improvement in HRQOL is the primary clinical goal. Many prior studies were case series and focused on feasibility, proof of concept, and quantifying risks with less emphasis on quantifying impact on HRQOL.  1,2,4,5,17-23  In our subset analysis, 48% of patients had a clinically signifi  cant\n(Continued)\n[     1 4 7\n#  5\nCHEST\nMAY   2 0 1 5\n]\n(Continued)",

Th is is consistent with prior studies of therapeutic bronchoscopy for malignant central airway obstruction, which also demonstrated improvements in dyspnea and HRQOL as measured by disease-specifi  c instruments. 2,4,5,17-23  Although useful, these prior studies are not suffi cient to fully inform clinical decision-making, because the trade-off  s involve different units that cannot be easily compared. For example, what risk of death is acceptable to achieve success, when success is defi  ned as relief of anatomic obstruction? What if we defi  ne success in terms of dyspnea? Since therapeutic bronchoscopy for malignant central airway obstruction is essentially palliative, we need to quantify the HRQOL gains in units that allow physicians to compare the benefi  ts accrued to the risks incurred. Th is requires a specifi  c type of HRQOL instrument-a generic single-index measure such as the SF-6D that can be used to calculate utilities (additional details on HRQOL instruments can be found in   e-Appendix 1  ).\nTh is is the fi  rst report, to our knowledge, of therapeutic bronchoscopy for malignant central airway obstruction from a multicenter registry that evaluates technical success and dyspnea relief and combines it with an analysis of utility. Th e MCID for the SF-6D has been estimated to be 0.033 (95% CI, 0.029-0.037). 15,25  Th is is similar to the MCID for other indirect utility measures, such as the Health Utilities Index Mark 2 (HU12), Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HU13), and EQ-5D  . 25,26  Our data suggest that when baseline dyspnea is higher, interventions have a greater impact on utility. We also found that patients with more severe functional impairment were more likely to benefi  t from intervention. Of note, with respect to the outcomes of dyspnea relief and utility, there was no single best method in terms of ablative techniques, and there was no single best type of stent.\nTh is study provides a more accurate assessment of the relationship between baseline dyspnea, improvements in dyspnea, the resulting improvement in utility, and how physicians might use this to weigh the benefi  ts of intervention vs the possibility of procedure-related complications. Specifi  cally, although high ASA score and more severe functional impairment predict increased risk of complications and adverse events, the benefi  ts of intervention are also higher and probably warrant careful consideration. Based on these fi  ndings, high levels of functional impairment and high surgical risk should not necessarily preclude bronchoscopic intervention, provided that there is signifi  cant dyspnea and that the dyspnea is contributing to the patient's poor performance status.\nAlthough these fi  ndings are useful, it is important to recognize the limitations of the data. Although we did fi  nd that stenting was associated with higher technical success rates, this needs to be weighed against the risk of longer-term complications that may arise. 27-29  Similarly, although this is the fi  rst study to our knowledge to evaluate change in utility following therapeutic bronchoscopy, the outcomes measured are short term (ie, 30 days). Longer term studies that measure quality-adjusted survival beyond 30 days will be needed so that qualityadjusted life years can be determined. Th is has been done for malignant pleural eff  usions, and a similar method could be used for therapeutic bronchoscopy. 30 In addition, although we did not fi  nd evidence of a relationship between average number of cases per month and technical success rates, the number of patients enrolled from low-volume centers was small. Th erefore, the fi  ndings on volume-outcome relationships should be considered as limited and preliminary. In addition, the data on dyspnea and HRQOL were available for only a subset of patients from select centers, and these patients diff  ered from the rest of the cohort in some regards, so the generalizability of the fi  ndings needs to be verifi  ed. Finally, the indications for the procedures may have diff  ered in subtle but signifi  cant ways. Physicians may choose to intervene 'early' for lesions that are anatomically signifi  cant ( . 50% stenosis) even when patients do not have dyspnea, if the perception is that the disease is likely to progress. In such instances, improvements in dyspnea and even HRQOL are likely to be small. Th is does not necessarily mean that such early interventions are ineff  ective, since they presumably prevent future deterioration and may allow procedures to be done in an elective manner while patients are more stable. As such, predictors of impact on dyspnea and HRQOL may be subject to subtle confounding by indication, since the indication for some of these procedures may be to avoid future deterioration in dyspnea and HRQOL, whereas in other instances the indication is for immediate relief.\nIn conclusion, this report from the AQuIRE registry is the fi  rst multicenter registry study, to our knowledge, of therapeutic bronchoscopy for malignant central airway obstruction to evaluate patient and hospital predictors of technical success, impact on dyspnea, and changes in utility. Procedures were usually technically successful, with 93% of patients having their central airways reopened. No single ablative technology was superior in terms of achieving technical success, although stenting was associated with improved success",
