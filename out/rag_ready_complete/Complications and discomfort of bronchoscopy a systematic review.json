There are numerous indications for bronchoscopy, and it is frequently used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in both inpatients and outpatients. White light FB is commonly used in diagnostics, as it enables visualisation of the lower airways and sampling techniques such as bronchial brushings (BB), bronchial washings (BW), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), endobronchial biopsies (EBB), transbronchial biopsies (TBB), and transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) (1).\nBronchoscopy is generally considered safe (2). However, whether performed with anaesthesia or only light sedation, pre-procedural medications are routinely administered and may have side effects. Diagnostic sampling may lead to immediate, although rare, complications, such as intrabronchial bleeding, bronchospasm, and pneumothorax. In addition, some discomfort may be felt in the days after the procedure, such as fever, sore throat, cough, or reactions to the medications used (1).\nEvents occurring after the observation period may not be detected by the bronchoscopist. To ensure that both the bronchoscopy team and the patient are adequately prepared for the procedure, a realistic picture of the potential for complications and discomfort is imperative.\nTo the best of our knowledge, there is no recent systematic review of complications and discomfort associated with bronchoscopy. The 2013 British Thoracic Society Guidelines (2) includes a comprehensive overview of complications, but only presents a few selected references without discussing potential weaknesses of the included studies.\nThus, we set out to conduct a systematic review of complications and patient discomfort associatedwith noninterventional bronchoscopy, and the frequency and predictors of these in patients and research subjects.",

Keywords were selected by combining existing thesauruses (MeSH terms) and text words. We performed a review of the existing MeSH database and of the (MeSH) classification of relevant papers that were already published. In addition, we added text words considered relevant to describe complications known to the authors.\nThe search in PubMed was conducted on 8 February 2016.\nWe included publications in English, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, and French. Case reports, non-original research (letters, review articles, guidelines, etc.), animal studies, studies solely based on interventional procedures and specialised examination techniques, studies on paediatric populations as well as studies of intubated patients, patients on mechanical ventilation, under general anaesthesia or in an intensive care unit (ICU), were excluded, along with publications that did not cover the topic on complications or discomfort associated with bronchoscopy.\nStudies on bronchoscopes as a source of contamination were considered outside the scope of the current review.\nPapers were classified as prospective or retrospective, and whether investigation of complications and discomfort was considered an objective (primary, secondary, not formalised). We also divided articles into three groups based on the number of subjects in the study and identified studies on medication during or before bronchoscopy.\nFull review was only performed on papers where complications or discomfort was a primary or secondary objective of the study, where the number of subjects exceeded 50, and where there was given a sufficient description of the sample and the sampling methods (inclusion/exclusion criteria, definition of endpoints, and data collection). We chose to exclude papers based on less than 50 subjects since the statistical power of these studies in detecting rare complications is bound to be low.",

      "content": "We have presented a systematic review on complications and discomfort of FB. Severe complications were rare; pneumothorax requiring intervention was reported in 0 /C1 2.1% of patients who had undergone TBB (64, 72). Mortality rate was low, but it was difficult to compare between studies that were performed on more or less selected populations. The willingness to repeat bronchoscopy was well above 50%.\nRates of specific complications ranged considerably, as in the case of oxygen desaturation [0.7 /C1 76.3% of patients (80, 81)] and bleeding (2.5 /C1 89.9% of patients) (59, 62). There are several potential reasons for this: the wide range of definitions (discussed below), different schemes for\ndata collection, differences in equipment and techniques, differences between patient populations, and possibly time-dependent inter-study differences, as there are more than 40 years of gap between the publications included in this review. We argue that the considerable variability in complication rates can be attributed to a lack of consensus on how to define and measure complications and that many of the presented studies have a modest sample size .\nPatient tolerance was difficult to assess as all studies utilised different measures of discomfort. VAS and NRS were mostly used to compare subgroups receiving different drug regimens, and it was unclear whether the results of these studies were representative for clinical practice.\nFurthermore, absolute scale values were rarely presented in result sections, as relative comparison between subgroups was preferred.\nThe closest we got to a mortality rate that is representative of routine clinical practice was in one of the excluded studies. Facciolongo and co-workers reported a mortality rate of 0.02% in a large prospective study in 19 centres conducting diagnostic and therapeutic bronchoscopy. All deaths were somehow related to patients with a scheduled bronchoscopic laser treatment. This report was excluded from our main review because the authors did not specify how patients were selected for inclusion, and with regard to other complications they reported an unusual low number of incidents (1.08% of procedures) (24).\nThat we had to resolve to referring an excluded article when discussing a major outcome such as mortality illustrated one potential weakness of our approach /C1 we might have applied much rigorous exclusion criteria. However, the informed reader needs to evaluate the external validity of the included studies, and we considered a comprehensive description of the sampling process as imperative for this purpose. We have also chosen to exclude more specific procedures such as bronchoscopy in the ICU, endobronchial ultrasound (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)), and interventional ultrasound, which should be topics of separate, future reviews.\nAlthough bronchoscopy appeared to be a safe procedure in terms of mortality, bleeding, and pneumothoraces, it was difficult to conclude regarding the frequency of other specific complications. The inter-study variation in definitions of specific complications was considerable if the outcomes were defined at all. In particular, this could be exemplified by the variation in desaturation and bleeding rates, as well as cough, health care utilisation, and discomfort. The variation in definitions of 'complications' can have several reasons, but it is likely due to the researchers' and clinicians' perception of what can be considered significant complications, and which adverse events are relevant for a specific patient group. Definitions may also vary due to available tools for recording adverse events. We also observed a lack of studies addressing\ncomplications and discomfort related to specific sampling techniques, sedation, duration of the procedure, and experience of the bronchoscopist. Similarly, there were few articles that reported patient characteristics related to safety and discomfort, such as indication for bronchoscopy, comorbidities, age, and pre-procedural anxiety. In the case of hypoxaemia, only two of the studies that provided desaturation rates specified a pre-procedural minimum resting/room air saturation of the participants ( /C21 90%) (77, 79). Few subtopics in our article present predictors of complications, and we cannot, finally, conclude on predictors of complication. This is mainly due to predictors not being presented in the reviewed articles, which could result from insufficient statistical power.",

      "content": "To conclude, bronchoscopy is a safe procedure in terms of complications such as mortality, pneumothorax, and bleeding that necessitate intervention. However, we should be able to inform patients in less broad strokes, with details concerning risk of both complications and what clinicians would characterise as discomforts. To provide this information, we need a sufficiently powered, prospective study on a well-described sample with clear definitions of complications that at least include mortality, pneumothorax, desaturation, bleeding, hypotension, arrhythmia, fever, and 'willingness to return'. Characteristics of participants and procedures should be related to the outcomes in order to identify high-risk procedures. In addition, all complications should be characterised in terms of necessary intervention.",
