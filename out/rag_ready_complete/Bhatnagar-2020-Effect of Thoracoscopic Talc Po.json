A total of 330 participants were enrolled from August 2012 to April 2018 and followed up until October 2018. Patients were eligible if they were older than 18 years, had a confirmed diagnosis of MPE, and could undergo thoracoscopy with local anesthesia. Patients were excluded if they required a thoracoscopy for diagnostic purposes or had evidence of nonexpandable lung. INTERVENTIONS Patients randomized to the talc poudrage group (n = 166) received 4 g of talc poudrage during thoracoscopy while under moderate sedation, while patients randomized to the control group (n = 164) underwent bedside chest tube insertion with local anesthesia followed by administration of 4 g of sterile talc slurry. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was pleurodesis failure up to 90 days after randomization. Secondary outcomes included pleurodesis failure at 30 and 180 days; time to pleurodesis failure; number of nights spent in the hospital over 90 days; patient-reported thoracic pain and dyspnea at 7, 30, 90, and 180 days; health-related quality of life at 30, 90, and 180 days; all-cause mortality; and percentage of opacification on chest radiograph at drain removal and at 30, 90, and 180 days.\nRESULTS Among 330 patients who were randomized (mean age, 68 years; 181 [55%] women), 320 (97%) were included in the primary outcome analysis. At 90 days, the pleurodesis failure rate was 36 of 161 patients (22%) in the talc poudrage group and 38 of 159 (24%) in the talc slurry group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.54-1.55]; P = .74; difference, –1.8% [95% CI, –10.7% to 7.2%]). No statistically significant differences were noted in any of the 24 prespecified secondary outcomes.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with malignant pleural effusion, thoracoscopic talc poudrage, compared with talc slurry delivered via chest tube, resulted in no significant difference in the rate of pleurodesis failure at 90 days.

Pulmonologist-led thoracoscopy with local anesthesia and moderate sedation (also known as pleuroscopy ) is now an established alternative to thoracoscopy with general anesthesia, 11 although most randomized studies regarding pleurodesis have used the latter, meaning existing data may not be representative of current practice. 8\nThere is no consensus on whether slurry or poudrage is the more effective technique for delivering talc to patients with MPE, thus, clinical practice and recommendations are inconsistent. 4,12 Previous studies have been inconclusive or criticized because of small sample sizes, the use of surrogate or non-patient-focused outcomes, and high rates of serious adverse events related to the use of ungraded talc formulations. 13-15\nThis study was designed to test the hypothesis that talc poudrageduringthoracoscopywithlocalanesthesiawasmore effective than talc slurry delivered via chest tube at inducing pleurodesis in patients with MPE.",

There were 27 (17%) deaths before pleurodesis failure in the poudrage group and 34 (21%) in the slurry group. A post hoc sensitivity analysis that incorporated mortality as a competing risk showed similar results to the primary analysis (hazard ratio, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.58-1.43]; eTable S23 in Supplement 2). Additional sensitivity analyses supported these results (eTables S21 and S22 and eFigure S3 in Supplement 2).

      "content": "In this randomized clinical trial that compared the efficacy of talc poudrage delivered during thoracoscopy with moderate sedation vs chest tube and talc slurry in inducing pleurodesis in individuals with MPE, there was no significant difference between the treatments in the primary outcome of pleurodesis failure rate at 90 days. Results of sensitivity analyses supportedthisfinding.Nosignificantdifferencesinsecondaryoutcomeswerenoted,includingpleurodesisfailurerateat180days and all-cause mortality.\nPrevious studies addressing the optimal method for talc delivery have been considered inconclusive, resulting in inconsistency in both practice and recommendations. 4,12 The study by Dresler et al, 14 which analyzed 482 patients, also found no significant difference between talc poudrage and slurry (failure rates of 22% vs 29% at 30 days), but required patients to be well enough to undergo general anesthesia and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, noted high respiratory complication rates as a result of ungraded talc being used, and adopted a primary outcome for pleurodesis that was assessed radiologically rather than in a clinically oriented fashion. 14\nIt has previously been shown that talc slurry can be administeredsafelyandeffectivelyonanoutpatientbasisthrough anindwellingpleuralcatheter. 29 Withthatapproach,pleurodesis failure was substantially more common than noted in this study (57% at 35 days after randomization), although no direct comparison has ever been made with the inpatient methods described in the current study. 30\nAside from perceived benefits in pleurodesis success, a clinician's choice of talc poudrage or talc slurry has traditionally been based on several factors, including whether a chest\ntube has already been inserted; local infrastructure, experience, and training; and patient phenotype with regard to fluid production and accessibility. However, increasing priority is now given to recognizing patient choice in MPE management. 6,7,31 The current data lend further support to the development of flexible treatment pathways, with treatment for individuals with MPE tailored to the wishes, needs, and risk factors of the individual patient, with the knowledge that treatment effectiveness is unlikely to be affected by how talc is delivered. 7,30,32",
