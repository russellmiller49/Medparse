      "content": "Despite optimal pharmacological therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation, many  patients  with  chronic  obstructive pulmonary  disease  (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD))  remain  very disabled. 1 In carefully selected patients with emphysema, lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) to resect the worst a/uniFB00  ected areas of  lung  has  improved  lung  function,  exercise  capacity health  status,  and  survival. 2 However,  this  surgical  intervention  is  associated  with  substantial  morbidity,  and  an early  mortality  rate  of  about  5%  was  reported  in  the National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT) trial, 2 although  recent  case  series  have  reported  lower  rates. 3 Nevertheless, there is still reluctance to refer patients for LVRS, 4 and there has been considerable interest in\ndeveloping novel treatment approaches that can also reduce lung  volumes  and  gas  trapping,  either  more  safely  than LVRS, or else in patients for whom LVRS is not an option. 5-11\nOne approach is placing endobronchial valves in the airways supplying the most emphysematous part of the lung using a fi  breoptic bronchoscope (ie, bronchoscopic lung volume reduction, BLVR). The valves allow air to leave but not enter the target lobe, causing it to collapse and  thus  reducing  gas  trapping.  In  heterogeneous disease  this  reduction  allows  the  relatively  healthier lung to function better by diverting air to more perfused areas  and  recruiting  previously  compressed  alveoli. Initial pilot work by our group and others was encouraging, showing that valve placement could",

The study showed statistically but not  clinically signifi  cant mean  di/uniFB00  erences  in  forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1 ; 6·85%) and 6 min walking distance  (5·7%)  between  BLVR  and  control  groups at  6  months.

Participants were recruited between March 1, 2012, and Sept 30, 2013.\nWe enrolled stable outpatients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who met the following  criteria:  FEV 1 of  less  than  50%  predicted; signifi  cant hyperinfl  ation (total lung capacity >100% and residual  volume  >150%);  a  restricted  exercise  capacity (6 min  walking distance <450 m)  and substantial breathlessness  (MRC  dyspnoea  score  ≥3).

Study  participants  underwent  either unilateral lobar endobronchial valve placement aiming to achieve lobar atelectasis (BLVR group), or bronchoscopy and sham valve placement (control group). All procedures were  done  in  the bronchoscopy  suite  at the Royal Brompton Hospital using moderate sedation with midazolam  and  alfentanyl.  Procedures  were  done  by  a single operator (PLS) with an expertise in interventional bronchoscopy who had done more than 50 endobronchial valve procedures before study commencement.\nAlthough  target lobe selection was based  on  CT appearance alone, measurements of collateral ventilation using  the  Chartis  (PulmonX,  Redwood  City,  CA,  USA) balloon catheter system were made in all participants so that the accuracy of the two approaches could be compared. 12 Endobronchial valves were placed to occlude segmental bronchi leading to the target lobe (irrespective of  the  Chartis  results).  All  procedures  were  unilateral. All  patients  underwent  a  chest  radiograph  after  the procedure to check for the presence of a pneumothorax, which was reviewed by the treatment team only. If this was satisfactory they were then discharged home. Patients were  counselled  and  provided  with  a  post-procedure information  sheet,  irrespective  of  treatment  allocation, giving advice on seeking medical attention in the presence of  chest  pain  or  sudden  breathlessness,  and  providing advice  for  medical  sta/uniFB00    if  the  patient  presented  as  an emergency.\nBaseline and 3 month follow-up visits were done by an assessment team masked to treatment allocation. Spirometry,  gas  transfer,  and  lung  volumes  assessed by body plethysmography were measured with a CompactLab  system  (Jaeger,  Hoechberg,  Germany). 13 Lung  function  tests  were  all  done  after  bronchodilator use. Predicted values used were those of the European Coal and Steel Community. 14,15 Patients underwent endurance cycle ergometry with metabolic measurements at  70%  of  their  maximum  workload  determined  on  an initial incremental test. Inspiratory capacity manoeuvres were  done  to  track  changes  in  dynamic  hyperinfl  ation assessed  as  end-expiratory  lung  volume.  Patients  also completed  a  6  min  walking  test  done  according  to American Thoracic Society guidelines on a 30 m course. 16 Health-related quality of life was assessed using the  St  George's  respiratory  questionnaire  for  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (SGRQc) 17 and  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  assessment  test  (CAT). 18,19 Target lobe volume change was assessed by a radiologist (DHC) as  an  explicatory  variable  and  scored  as  follows:  0,  no change; 1, some volume loss (fi  ssures shift); 2, segmental atelectasis (band of collapsed lung); 3, complete atelectasis (complete collapse).\n6MWD=6 min walking distance.

We considered an absolute di/uniFB00  erence in response between the two groups of 15% to be clinically signifi  cant. An 80% power and a signifi  cance  level  of  0·05  needed  21  patients  in  each group  assuming  that  the  mean  change  in  FEV 1 from baseline in the control group was 0% (2·5) and the mean change  in  the  group  receiving  BLVR  was  15%  (25). 50 patients were recruited to allow a 20% drop-out rate.\nData were entered into an electronic database developed by The Imperial College Clinical Trials Unit using InForm (Oracle, Reading, UK), and analysis was done by the trial statistician (WB) using Stata version 12 and SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA).

BLVR and control groups were generally well matched,  but  percent  predicted  residual  volume  and total lung capacity were higher in the control group. The\ntrial profi  le describing patient fl  ow through the study is shown in fi  gure 1. The median number of valves placed per patient was 3 (range 1-6). There were two deaths in the BLVR group and one control patient was unable to attend for follow-up assessment because of a prolonged pneumothorax; 3 month data were available for 23 patients receiving BLVR and 24 controls.\nResponse  to  treatment  was  assessed  at  3  months (mean [SD] 93 [12] days; table 2, fi  gure 2, and appendix). FEV1 increased  by  a  mean  24·8%  (95%  CI  8·0-41·5) from baseline in the BLVR group and 3·9% (0·7-7·1) in controls. However, the response in the BLVR group was heavily  skewed  so  non-parametric  tests  were  used  for analysis. Median (IQR) FEV 1 changes at 3 months were 8·77%  (2·27-35·85)  in  the  BLVR  group  and  2·88% (0-8·51) in controls (Mann-Whitney p=0·0326; table 2). The BLVR group also had a signifi  cant improvement in 6  min  walking  distance  and  T LIM on  cycle  ergometry (tables  2  and  3).  This  result  was  accompanied  by signifi  cant  improvements  in  lung  volumes  and  gas transfer. CAT and SGRQc scores improved more in the BLVR group but compared with the control group were not  statistically  signifi  cant.  Improvement  in  FEV 1 was not associated with any baseline variable (appendix).\nIn univariate analysis, improvement in cycle ergometry TLIM was  associated  with  improvements  in  spirometry, lung volumes, and gas transfer, and reductions in dynamic lung volumes, respiratory rate, and breath  lessness during exercise (table 4). In multivariate analysis, an increase in FEV1 was retained, together with a fall in isotime respiratory  rate  and  Borg  dyspnoea  score,  as  factors associated with improvement in T LIM ( r² =0·59, p<0·0001). In the BLVR group, eight patients were scored as having 'complete  collapse'  of  the  target  lobe,  fi  ve  'a  band  of atelectasis', two 'some volume loss', and eight no change.\nFour treated patients, despite having fi  ssures scored as intact on CT as a criterion for study entry, had collateral ventilation  detected  by  the  Chartis  system  (collateral ventilation  positive).  Table  5  compares  response  rates between  controls  and  the  whole  BLVR  group  and  the BLVR group with collateral ventilation positive patients excluded.  Of  note,  it  was  not  possible  to  determine collateral ventilation in six (12%) patients with the Chartis system, consistent with a previous study reporting a 7% failure rate. 26\nIndividual patient responses to treatment are shown in the appendix, including both absolute values and numbers  achieving  the  minimum  clinically  important di/uniFB00  erences  for  the  various  variables  measured.

The  second  patient  died  suddenly  3  days  after  valve placement. He underwent a post mortem; there was no evidence of pneumonia or pneumothorax and a diagnosis of  death  due  to  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  with  cor  pulmonale  was  made. One patient in the control group was too unwell to attend for  follow-up  because  of  a  spontaneous  pneumothorax with prolonged air leak with onset 66 days after his sham bronchoscopy.  Additionally,  two  patients  in  the  BLVR group  had  pneumothoraces  which  both  responded  to intercostal tube drainage, one at 3 days and one at 12 days after  the  procedure.  Four  patients  expectorated  a  valve before  3  months.  These  were  replaced  in  three  of four individuals before their follow-up visit. The patients were  instructed  not  to  inform  the  assessment  team  of these additional procedures.",

      "content": "Placement  of  endobronchial  valves  in  patients  with severe Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who have heterogeneous emphysema and intact interlobar fi  ssures on CT scan was associated with improvements  in  lung  function  and  exercise  capacity. This  prospective,  double-blind,  randomised,  controlled trial  is  the  fi  rst  study  of  bronchoscopic  treatment  to achieve this, through the use of an appropriately stratifi  ed approach  to  target  a  responder  emphysema  phenotype (panel).  Our data suggest that in appropriately selected patients, endobronchial valve placement results in\nimprovements in lung function which are of a similar order  of  magnitude  to  those  seen  with  LVRS. 2,3,27 The improvement in gas transfer is important because this is the lung function variable most strongly associated with survival in people with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 13 Previous trials such as VENT included many patients with collateral ventilation who therefore derived less benefi  t, in particular less lobar atelectasis,  which  is  a  key  determinant  of  e/uniFB00  ectiveness associated with improved lung function response 5,8 and survival. 7 Prospectively  stratifying  in  favour  of  patients with  heterogeneous  disease  and  radiologically  intact fi  ssures substantially increased the response rate.\nThe success rate of valve placement was higher than in previous studies because only patients with intact interlobar fi  ssures on CT were included; however, there were cases of positive collateral ventilation when assessed using  the  Chartis  system.  These  cases  were  associated with no benefi  t from treatment raising the possibility of an  additive  role  in  improving  patient  selection.  The Chartis system adds cost and time to procedures and its use cannot necessarily be recommended  based  on the present data. Furthermore, satisfactory Chartis measurements  were  not  always  possible  for  technical reasons (about 10%), a fi  nding consistent with previous studies. 26 We acknowledge that the positive and negative predictive power of collateral ventilation measured with the Chartis system will vary depending on the CT criteria and method of fi  ssure analysis used in the initial selection strategy because this will a/uniFB00  ect the pre-test probability of collateral  ventilation.  The  ideal  strategy  for  selecting patients in whom lobar exclusion can be achieved needs to be defi  ned and will remain unclear as refi  nements in technology and CT scoring of fi  ssure integrity evolve.\nA  key  issue  is  the  safety  of  this  treatment  approach. Spontaneous pneumothorax can occur when valve placement leads to a change in the conformation of the lung  and  can  be  a  marker  of  e/uniFB00  ective  lobar  occlusion. Therefore, as patient selection improves an increase in the\nTable 6: Adverse events\npneumothorax  rate  is  inevitable.  In  the  present  study pneumothorax  occurred  in  two  treated  patients  (8%) and  in  one  control  patient  (4%).  The  management  of pneumothorax  in  this  context  is  conventional,  usually with  intercostal  tube  drainage.  However,  it  is  important that patients are selected who are considered likely to be able  to  withstand  the  associated  acute  lung  function impairment a pneumothorax will cause. In part, bronchoscopic treatment for emphysema has been developed  for  people  considered  to  be  too  disabled  to withstand LVRS, but caution is needed given the pneumothorax risk. There were two deaths in the BLVR group. One occurred as a complication of valve removal, which  was  di/uniFB03 cult.  Therefore,  if  valves  need  to  be removed this should be done with limited force and if the valve cannot be removed easily a more controlled approach via  rigid  bronchoscopy  should  be  considered.  A  rigid bronchoscopy approach might also be appropriate where there is signifi  cant granulation tissue or where the valve is at an acute angle. Because rigid bronchoscopy tends to be done by surgeons rather than physicians, this emphasises the  importance of close liaison  with  thoracic  surgery  in the approach to the management of these patients.\nA  strength  of  the  study  was  the  masking  of  patients and  assessors.  The  presence  of  a  sham  bronchoscopy meant that a more confi  dent estimate could be made of changes  in  health  status  that  have  often  been  large  in unmasked  studies,  even  in  the  absence  of  signifi  cant changes in lung function. 28 The assessment of collateral ventilation  in  all  participants  using  the  Chartis  system\nmeant that control patients also underwent a procedure, which reinforced masking. Although patients in whom a pneumothorax  occurred  or  who  expectorated  a  valve were unmasked, valves are di/uniFB03 cult to visualise on chest radiographs and this maintained masking of physicians and patients alike if they underwent investigations for a clinical deterioration in the absence of a pneumothorax.\nThe  study  was  undertaken  at  a  single  centre  with experience in bronchoscopic procedures and in selecting patients for lung volume reduction. Therefore, it shows the results that are possible. However, for these results to be  generalisable,  it  will  require  the  establishment  of  a similar  clinical  infrastructure,  and  as  with  any  new technique, there is likely to be a learning curve as it is implemented.\nIn some patients, ideal positioning of the valves is not possible due to patient anatomy (eg, insu/uniFB03 cient length of bronchus to place the valve adequately leading to early expectoration, or di/uniFB03 cult access to a particular segment), which  might  a/uniFB00  ect the  e/uniFB00  ectiveness  of  valves  as  a treatment strategy. The present study was not su/uniFB03 ciently large for this to be an issue but we recommend in future studies that a bronchoscopic assessment of the technical feasibility of valve placement be included in the protocol. It remains the case that LVRS is an e/uniFB00  ective treatment in upper lobe predominant bullous emphysema regardless of fi  ssure integrity.\nFurther work is needed to establish how this technique should  best  be  deployed  relative  to  LVRS 2,3 and  other developing  techniques,  such  as  lung  volume  reduction coils 9 and bronchoscopic thermal vapour ablation. 29 Most importantly, there is a considerable overlap between the indications  for  BLVR  and  LVRS,  and  thus  a  stepwise approach  with  bronchoscopic  techniques  considered  at an  earlier  stage  to  defer,  prevent,  or  act  as  a  bridge  to LVRS could be appropriate. Alternatively, LVRS might be the  defi  nitive  treatment  that  should  be  o/uniFB00  ered  earlier. Prospective trials comparing LVRS and valve placement will be needed to clarify this.",

      "content": "Interest has grown in mechanical lung volume reduction approaches for patients with emphysema and a variety of bronchoscopic techniques are in development. The most widely studied bronchoscopic approach is endobronchial valves. We searched PubMed using the terms 'emphysema', 'chronic obstructive pulmonary disease', 'endobronchial valves', and 'bronchoscopic lung volume reduction', without restrictions on language or article type up until May 1, 2014, to identify any case reports, case series, and clinical trials of endobronchial valves for the treatment of emphysema. We identifi  ed only two randomised controlled trials that used a unilateral complete lobar occlusion approach, randomising a combined 416 patients to either an unmasked bronchoscopic procedure with valve implantation or to best medical care (no sham bronchoscopy). These studies showed the safety of endobronchial valves, but average benefi  ts were modest. In some patients there were dramatic improvements, in others no response. Retrospective analysis has suggested a responder phenotype with heterogeneous emphysema and intact interlobar fi  ssures identifi  ed on CT. In this UK National Institute for Health Research funded (and thus independent of industry) study, we sought to establish whether targeting patients with heterogeneous emphysema and intact interlobar fi  ssures on CT could improve outcomes. It is the fi  rst double-blind randomised\nsham-controlled trial of endobronchial valves.",
