    "abstract": "In this single-center series (1982â€“1993), 1,585 lung cancer patients underwent 2,253 rigid-bronchoscopic Nd:YAG laser treatments for malignant central airway obstruction. Immediate clinical/radiologic/endoscopic improvement occurred in 93%; median time to retreatment was 100 days, reflecting tumor regrowth as the chief limitation. Major complications were uncommon (hemorrhage n=18, transient pneumothorax n=6) with mortality 0.44%; laser debulking also facilitated curative or lesser surgery in select cases and was curative for a small subset with carcinoma in situ. The authors conclude Nd:YAG photoresection is a rapid, repeatable, palliative modality that restores airway patency and can be combined with radiotherapy, brachytherapy, stenting, or surgery. Keywords: airway obstruction, interventional bronchoscopy, laser debulking, outcomes, safety.",
