      "content": "Private Insurance\nMost working Americans obtain health insurance through their employers in the form of an employment benefits package. 1 Employers and employees enjoy a tax advantage as a result of offering and receiving health insurance benefits through the employment relationship. Most employers offer their workers a selection of health\ninsurance plans to choose from; these plans vary in scope of coverage, costs of premiums, and the amount of co-insurance and deductible to be paid by the employee. 2,3 Employers and employees generally share the costs of the insurance. Employer-provided group insurance usually costs less and offers more benefits than individual health insurance plans.\nEmployer-sponsored health insurance plans are typically either fee-for-service or various types of managed care plans (health maintenance organizations, HMOs, or preferred provider organizations). Fee-for-service insurance is a traditional form of health insurance in which, after providing health care services, the health care provider (or sometimes the patient) sends a bill to the insurance company. A typical fee-for-service plan may pay 80% of a medical bill, leaving 20% to be paid by the individual, known as 'co-insurance,' or may follow some other kind of prenegotiated payment arrangement.

In exchange, the HMO provides comprehensive coverage, including physician visits, hospital stays, laboratory tests, and therapy. In most HMOs, members are assigned or choose a physician who serves as their primary care physician. The primary care physician monitors the patient's health and provides basic medical care and is also responsible for referring patients to a specialist and other health care professionals as needed. Most HMOs do not require a deductible each year, but they do generally require a small copayment for each medical encounter. Because HMOs receive a fixed fee per member per month, they may focus more on providing preventative health care services, such as immunizations, mammograms, and physicals, and may be more restrictive of more advanced or experimental treatments. They may require 'preauthorization' for advanced procedures. Procedures such as electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy often fall into the category of 'experimental' despite the growing evidence to support its use for peripheral nodules and the approval process may be challenging. Preferred provider organizations are a variation on HMOs that are generally less flexible than traditional fee-for-service insurance plans, but more flexible than HMOs in terms of restrictions on where and from whom patients can receive care. 6",

      "title": "Medicare and Medicaid",
      "content": "Medicare and Medicaid are the 2 most important government-sponsored health insurance programs. Title XVIII of the Social Security Act of 1965 established Medicare. It is a federal health care program that covers most individuals 65 years or older as well as those under age 65 with certain disabilities, and patients of all ages requiring dialysis or renal transplant.\nMedicare Part A provides basic coverage for hospital stays, posthospital skilled nursing facility care, home health care, and hospice care and is financed from employee and employer contributions. Medicare Part B is medical insurance, which can be purchased by paying an additional monthly premium. It pays for physician and laboratory costs as well as some outpatient medical services, such as medical equipment and supplies, home health care, and physical therapy. Medicare Part C is an alternative in which individuals with Parts A and B can voluntarily choose to receive all of their health care services from a Medicare-\nmanaged care plan provided through private insurance companies. 7,8 Medicare Part D is a voluntary supplemental prescription drug program that requires an additional monthly premium.\nFor the most part, Medicare makes payments to providers on a fee-for-service basis, but it negotiates deep discounts for many services and procedures comparedwithmostprivateinsuranceplans. Some private insurance companies use similar relative value unitlike reimbursement schedules, as discussed in detail later in this article. Newer payment incentives are being proposed that would adjust payments by markers of quality, efficiency, and outcomes.\nMedicaid, on the other hand, is a joint federalstate health insurance program for individuals and families with low incomes and limited resources. 9 Although the federal government establishes broad guidelines for the Medicaid program, each state establishes its own eligibility standards, benefit packages, payment rates, and program administration. As a result, there are essentially 56 different Medicaid programs-one for each state, territory, and the District of Columbia. Medicaid programs generally cover physician services, inpatient and outpatient hospital care, nursing facility services, prescription drugs, dental care, physical therapy, rehabilitation services, and hospice care. Medicaid also pays providers primarily on a fee-for-service basis after negotiated discounts. Payment rates vary on a state-bystate basis and may fail to cover the actual cost of an interventional pulmonary procedure.",

      "content": "The most common means of reimbursement in North America is fee-for-service. In essence physicians are paid for each individual service rendered in this model of payment. Alternate means of reimbursement for physicians include relative value units (RVUs), capitation, pay for performance, and salary. In the advent of health care reform and cost containment in the United States and Canada, respectively, alternatives to fee-forservice are being sought and the means by which physicians will be reimbursed for services may be in flux over the next several years. Many provinces of Canada have alternate funding plans, a pay-forperformance-like incentive structure whereby physicians receive a base salary and in addition receive a performance-based incentive. The province negotiates salaries for various physician groups with the health care organization. In the United States, pay for performance, medical home, and accountable care organizations (ACO)\nare some of the alternatives currently being integrated as part of health care reform.",

There is ample evidence to suggest that more advanced training or subspecialization leads to better procedural outcomes, and this form of payment would potentially be favorable to interventional pulmonologists with specialized training who perform a higher volume of certain procedures, such as endobronchial ultrasound for lung cancer staging. 10-12 At present, no metrics or quality benchmarks have been established for interventional pulmonology; however, the AQuIRE initiative by the American College of Chest Physicians was established with this as a primary objective. In a pay-for-performance system, one might anticipate a financial disincentive for performing diagnostic procedures, such as transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) with less proficiency than an established minimal diagnostic yield.",

      "content": "With respect to medical home, this strategy takes a more holistic approach whereby the primary care physician plays a central role and manages the entire care team, including any required specialists. 13,14 Under the medical home arrangement, the interventional pulmonologist or thoracic surgeon would be invited to provide an episode of care or procedure for a patient and would be paid from funds controlled by the referring primary care physician. A prespecified sum is paid for the care of the patient and distributed by the medical home as appropriate. Disease-specific medical homes have also been proposed, particularly in the context of a complex chronic disease whereby the central physician would drive the care of the patient. One could imagine a lung cancer medical home with the pulmonologist or medical oncologist becoming a primary care of sorts and managing the disease-specific care of the patient, including testing, counseling, and therapy, provided by the patient's multidisciplinary team. The interventional pulmonologist or thoracic surgeon in this context could be either a team leader or alternatively a member of the multidisciplinary team and be compensated for their portion of the care provided by the service line. The idea of a more comprehensive 'medical neighborhood' that would more seamlessly incorporate and integrate subspecialty care into the medical home has also been proposed. 15",

In such a system, a network of physicians or an entire hospital would take responsibility for the care of a group of patients. They would assume both the clinical and the financial burden of their care. Quality metrics would be implemented and the cost of providing the care would be compared with that traditionally paid for by Medicare for the same care. Providers are incentivized if both the quality and the cost reduction targets are met. Incentives are in the form of a predetermined proportion of the cost savings. Models such as these promote cost-effective care and published/unpublished data would suggest that management of pleural disease, mediastinal staging, and lung nodules by intervention pulmonary procedures is cost-effective. 17-21 It is likely on this basis that centers such as Kaiser Permanente have expanded their services to include interventional pulmonary procedures.

      "title": "Fee for Service",
      "content": "Most centers in Canada and the United States are fee-for-service. In a fee-for-service model, the interventional pulmonologist, thoracic surgeon, or his/her surrogate negotiates with payers a fee for the procedure or episode of care based on a predetermined fee schedule. The fee schedule assigns an amount according to the current procedural terminology (CPT) code for said procedure. The major concerns with this model are 2-fold: (1) it incentivizes physicians to perform procedures to generate revenue and (2) it may not adequately compensate for physician time or be commensurate with the specialized skill/training necessary to perform the procedure proficiently. In Canada, additional monies may be allocated to physicians based on the time of day the procedure is performed or alternatively the time it takes to perform the procedure. Some interventional pulmonology procedures are subject to a global fee (ie, a single payment for the entire episode of care including the postprocedural management). Thoracoscopy falls into this category. Compensation for the same procedure is highly variable in a fee-forservice model depending on the payer. Self-pay and private insurance tend to reimburse much higher than Medicare or Medicaid for the same service. As stated, reimbursement is subject to discounts negotiated by the care facility and this\nmay be a significant proportion of the billed service.\nIt is important for interventional pulmonologists to keep in mind the facility fees associated with the procedures as this significantly impacts the true cost of the procedure as well as downstream revenue. Those planning to establish a pulmonary procedure service or interventional pulmonary practice need to consider not simply the initial investment for equipment to perform procedures but also all the many direct and indirect costs. The direct costs of pulmonary procedures would include non-reusable materials, such as forceps, chest tubes, or transbronchial needles, equipment such as bronchoscopes, and labor (ie, the nursing or technical support in the procedure room). Indirect costs on the other hand would take into account the overhead incurred for the bronchoscopy suite and/or operating room. In addition, medicolegal support, maintenance, administration, billings, and collections are all considered indirect costs. The importance of considering all of the costs attributable to a procedure is that these are distributed over the entire patient population served bythe interventional pulmonologist and highly influence the potential for downstream revenue generation. 22 There is a minimum number of procedures to beperformedbyanygiveninstitutionto break even, and profit will be nonexistent until this threshold is met. Only once this threshold is exceeded does an interventional pulmonary practice become revenue-generating for its sponsoring institution. The breakeven point is individualized but should be considered before establishing a new pleural or bronchoscopy service line.",

      "title": "RVU",
      "content": "The RVU system is a scale used by Medicare and many private insurance companies to determine payments to providers. The scale is adjusted by the amount of physician work, practice expense, and professional liability coverage required to provide a given service. 23 A physician work RVU\nis assigned based on the amount of time, mental effort, and judgment, as well as technical skill and effort required to perform each service. Despite many advances in technology in interventional pulmonology, many of the assigned RVUs have remained stable. The practice expense component takes into account the nonphysician labor, building space, equipment, and supplies required to run a practice. The practice expense RVU payment value varies by the location where the procedure is being provided: if in a physician office or clinic, more of the infrastructure expense is incurred by the physician practice and the RVU is higher. On the contrary, when performed in a facility such as a hospital-based procedure center, the practice expense RVU is considerably lower because most of the infrastructure expense is embedded in the facility's costs, which in part explains the move in gastroenterology to provide procedural services in outside procedure centers or 'surgi-centers.'\nEach procedure or service is assigned an RVU according to this scale, and payment is commensurate with the RVUs assigned. For example, the standard multiplier in 2013 is $34.023, which is flat from the 2012 value. A geographic practice cost index is applied to each service to account for regional differences in the cost of maintaining a practice and the variation in liability insurance. Physician work and practice expenses account for about 96% of the RVU payment and liability insurance for only 4%. Table 1 provides a tabular representation of the RVU breakdown for commonly performed IP procedures.",

Applying the modifier code will typically lead\nto higher reimbursement for that particular procedure.\nThere are 2 types of modifiers: level I, that are 2-digit numerical codes applied to the CPT codes issued by the AMA, and level II, that are alphanumeric codes applied to the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes issued by CMS. 24 The most common level I modifier codes used by interventional pulmonologists are listed in Table 3 and include '25' for a 'separately identifiable evaluation and management service by the same physician on the same day of the procedure or other service'; this may be applied when the IP physician performs an evaluation and management (E&M) on a patient on the same day that an IP procedure is performed. The modifier is\nadded to the E&M code rather than to the procedural code, which is important because the modifier increases the likelihood that both the E&M and the procedure will be reimbursed. The modifier does not guarantee full reimbursement; rather the most reliable strategy is to separate the clinical evaluation from the procedure by 2 business days such that the payer sees these as separate episodes of care. Other useful modifiers in IP practice include '51' for 'multiple procedures' if, for example, an initial thoracentesis reveals an empyema and a subsequent chest tube placed the same day; or '57,' 'decision for surgery,' which may be used if an initial thoracentesis reveals a highly loculated effusion and the patient then proceeds to thoracoscopy. The most commonly used level II code used by interventional pulmonologists is likely to be 'AF' for specialty physician.",

      "content": "Future changes are inevitable in the funding and reimbursement arrangements discussed in this article. For those interested in establishing, expanding or optimizing their interventional pulmonology practice, understanding and effectively using the current systems of reimbursement are critical. However, it will also be imperative for IP practices to be nimble and adapt to the changing landscape of medical need, legislative mandates, and reimbursement policy. Interventional pulmonologists are regularly asked to perform more complicated and advanced procedures, but the reimbursement for time, effort, and skill involved in these procedures has not kept up with reimbursement for other procedural specialties. 29,30 In fact, in areas such as endobronchial ultrasound, reimbursement has decreased over the past several years.\nThe Affordable Care Act (ACA), passed in 2010 and currently under review in Congress, promises to introduce new incentives for quality and efficiency by rewarding quality outcomes. Much remains to be seen about how the ACA will affect interventional pulmonology, and many changes can be expected to the law before it is finally implemented. 31 It is expected, for example, that the ACA could benefit 'interventionalists' through quality incentives for achieving better outcomes for the procedures they are highly trained to perform, as has been anticipated with the use of intensivist staffing of intensive care units. 32 On\nthe other hand, IP procedures are inherently complex and commonly performed in very sick patients with advanced cancer or end-stage pulmonary disease. One could imagine that the disincentives proposed by the ACA for poor outcomes, complications, and readmissions may discourage interventional pulmonologists from caring for those in greatest need of palliation. On the other hand, it may also result in greater scrutiny and decrease 'futile' procedures (ie, those done 'just because you can and not because it is the right thing for the patient'). The addition of quality metrics may at some point also bring to light the additional liability of an interventional pulmonary practice, having the potential to in turn impact on professional responsibility premiums, further influencing revenue generation.\nAs the ACA comes on board in the next several years and introduces new incentives for quality and efficiency, interventional pulmonologists will want to be poised to capitalize on these incentives. Understanding the current landscape of the business of interventional pulmonology is crucial to ensure appropriate preparation and involvement in the direction of the future of the field.",
