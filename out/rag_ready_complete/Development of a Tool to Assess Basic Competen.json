    "abstract": "Rationale: Rigid bronchoscopy is increasingly used by pulmonologists for the management of central airway disorders. However, an assessment tool to evaluate the competency of operators in the performance of this technique has not been developed. We created the Rigid Bronchoscopy Tool for Assessment of Skills and Competence (RIGID-TASC) to serve as an objective, competencyoriented assessment tool of basic rigid bronchoscopic skills, including rigid bronchoscopic intubation and central airway navigation. Objectives: To assess whether RIGID-TASC scores accurately distinguish the basic rigid bronchoscopy skills of novice, intermediate, and expert operators, and to determine whether RIGID-TASC has adequate interrater reliability when used by different independent testers. Methods: At two academic medical centers in the United States, 30 physician volunteers were selected in three categories: 10 novices at rigid bronchoscopy (performed at least 50 /uniFB02 exible, but no rigid, bronchoscopies), 10 operators with intermediate experience (performed 5 -20 rigid bronchoscopies), and 10 experts (performed > 100 rigid bronchoscopies). Participants included pulmonary and critical care fellows, interventional pulmonology fellows, and faculty interventional pulmonologists. Each subject then performed rigid bronchoscopic intubation and navigation on a manikin, while being scored independently by two testers, using RIGID-TASC. Measurements and Main Results: Mean scores for three categories (novice, intermediate, and expert) were 58.10 ( 6 4.6 [SE]), 78.15 ( 6 3.8), and 94.40 ( 6 1.1), respectively. There was signi /uniFB01 cant difference between novice and intermediate (20.05, 95% con /uniFB01 dence interval [CI] = 7.77 -32.33, P = 0.001), and intermediate and expert (16.25, 95% CI = 3.97 -28.53, P = 0.008) operators. The interrater reliability (intraclass correlation coef /uniFB01 cient) between the two testers was high ( r = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.90 -0.98). Conclusions: RIGID-TASC showed evidence of construct validity andinterrater reliability in this setting and group of subjects. It can be used to reliably and objectively score and classify operators from novice to expert in basic rigid bronchoscopic intubation and navigation. RIGID-TASC is a 23-point checklist that gives a score of 0 -100 (Appendix). It is designed to assess proper assembly of the rigid bronchoscope, correct positioning of the patient, atraumatic introduction of the bronchoscope through the upper airway, trachea, and mainstem bronchi, number of attempts, and time required to complete the task. Every point addresses an important step in the process. A score of ' 1 ' is given based on a ' yes ' response, or ' 0 ' based on a ' no ' response. There are no partial scores, to allow for reproducible scoring and avoid subjectivity. The score for each item in RIGIDTASC was weighted to achieve a composite score, as is standard practice (9 -12) and used in development of other bronchoscopy tools, such as Bronchoscopy Skills and Task Assessment Tool (BSTAT) and Endobronchial Ultrasound Skills and Task Assessment Tool (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-STAT) (13, 14).

Interventional pulmonary fellowships have been introduced in the United States, and\nformal training in rigid bronchoscopy is considered a backbone of these programs. However, within these training programs, there is no standard approach to performing rigid bronchoscopy, and procedural numbers vary widely from program to program (2, 3). Consequently,\nan objective tool to permit assessment of procedural competence is urgently needed to ensure adequate training of interventional pulmonologists completing these programs.\nThe American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP), American Thoracic\nSociety, and European Respiratory Society have recommended a minimum number of 20 rigid bronchoscopy procedures for initial competency (4, 5). This number is solely based on expert opinion, as opposed to discernible scienti /uniFB01 c evidence. Recent guidelines from ACCP have acknowledged this limitation (6). Multiple studies have shown that trainees can show signi /uniFB01 cant variation in the rate at which they acquire procedural skills, leading to operators with differing skill levels at these recommended ' threshold ' numbers, hence concluding that performance-based metrics be incorporated into the process of competency assessment (7, 8).\nTo address the need for competencybased assessment of rigid bronchoscopy, we developed an objective, 23-point, checklist-based instrument, the Rigid Bronchoscopy Tool for Assessment of Skills and Competence (RIGID-TASC). This instrument assesses the basic competency of an operator in performing rigid bronchoscopic intubation and central airway navigation. We hypothesized that: ( 1 ) RIGID-TASC can discriminate between rigid bronchoscopy operators at novice, intermediate, and expert levels based on their intubation and central airway navigation skills, thus establishing construct validity; and ( 2 ) RIGID-TASC has adequate interrater reliability, generating reproducible scores when used by independent examiners.",

Novice operators were de /uniFB01 ned as physicians who had performed more than 50 /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopies, but no rigid bronchoscopies. These novices were given a 10-minute instruction on the basic techniques of rigid bronchoscopy and bronchoscopic intubation before testing. Intermediate operators were de /uniFB01 ned as operators who had performed 5 -20 rigid bronchoscopies, and at least 50 /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopies. The expert group was de /uniFB01 ned as operators who had performed more than 100 rigid bronchoscopies. The operators were also asked to complete a survey with their demographics, number of /uniFB02 exible and rigid bronchoscopies, selfassessed expertise level, and other variables.\nA 10-mm (outer diameter) rigid bronchoscope (Bryan Corp.,Woburn, MA) was introduced in a manikin (Nakhosteen Bronchoscopy Model; CLA, Coburg, Germany).

      "title": "Discussion",
      "content": "RIGID-TASC demonstrated validity and reliability as an assessment tool of rigid bronchoscopic intubation and airway navigation, in the settings and subjects of this study. Validity was demonstrated by its ability to discriminate operators based on their skills into novice, intermediate, and expert categories. Reliability was shown by its high interrater agreement, with\nindependent examiners generating reproducible and similar scores for operators at the same expertise level.\nRigid bronchoscopy is frequently used for management of malignant and benign central airway disorders. The advantages of using a rigid bronchoscope include the maintenance of a secure airway with effective ventilation and oxygenation while multiple rigid and /uniFB02 exible instruments are introduced through the bronchoscope (15, 16). Thus far, rigid bronchoscopy training has lacked an objective tool for assessment of competency and taskspeci /uniFB01 c feedback. Indeed, a tool has been introduced recently for otolaryngology trainees (17, 18), yet the clinical training and scope of practice of an interventional pulmonologist are very different from those of an otolaryngologist. Hence, we designed RIGID-TASC for evaluating rigid bronchoscopy intubation and central airway navigation skills, with the goal of its being incorporated in the interventional\npulmonology curriculum as an objective scoring and feedback tool.\nMeasuring and assessing competency is a complex task. Assessment of clinical skills can be performed using a standardized and validated checklistbased assessment tool. A checklist is a series of desired and effective behaviors or steps, which, when undertaken in a certain order, add up to a complex competency (19). Checklists are of proven educational and safety-enhancing value in a variety of /uniFB01 elds, including complex physician -patient interactions, such as operative procedures (20 -23). The BSTAT and the Endobronchial Ultrasound Skills and Task Assessment Tool are examples of checklist-based tools that have been introduced to assess the competency of the operators in /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopy and endobronchial ultrasound, respectively (13, 14).\nAn important aspect of developing a checklist-based assessment tool is to ensure that it captures the important components or steps of that complex task, and that these constituent elements are weighted appropriately (24). According to Nunnally (20), the plan and procedures of constructing measures is a primary determinant of construct validity.\nTherefore, the most important step in adopting a task checklist is to identify the key constituent steps in the performance of that task. We designed RIGID-TASC to precisely assess the most important steps in rigid bronchoscopic intubation and navigation, focusing our attention speci /uniFB01 cally on the safety and avoidance of trauma to the upper and lower airways (our emphasis on weighting each step primarily being safety, effectiveness, and dif /uniFB01 culty to master that step). It retains its discriminatory qualities when the rigid bronchoscopy performance is broken down into its subcategories, such as\nbronchoscope assembly and positioning of patient, upper and lower airway navigation, number of attempts, and time required to complete the procedure.\nAn important aspect of RIGID-TASC is an emphasis on the time required to complete the procedure (from introduction of bronchoscope into the mouth to manipulation up to carina in less than 60 s) and the number of attempts required to do so. Although a ' rushed ' procedure is never desirable, the interval from scope introduction to full intubation is the period in which the patient has undergone anesthesia induction and is thus apneic or hypopneic, while lacking a secure airway. Thus, the duration of this component of the procedure is indeed critical. This is especially true in light of the fact that many patients undergoing rigid bronchoscopy\nhave multiple comorbidities, particularly critical central airway obstruction. Hence, a safe and atraumatic yet rapid intubation is integral to the overall principles of safety and effectiveness.\nIn a survey of pulmonary and critical care fellowship program directors, Pastis and colleagues (2) demonstrated that only 18% of the surveyed programs offered formal training in rigid bronchoscopy (range of 0 -200 procedures). As expected, programs with a dedicated interventional pulmonology service had a higher likelihood of exposure to rigid bronchoscopy. However, the majority of trainees did not achieve exposure to the threshold number of procedures considered optimal for basic competence. In a recent survey by Yarmus and colleagues (3) of interventional\npulmonology fellowship programs, the mean number of rigid bronchoscopies reported by the fellows was 122 (range, 62 -187), clearly demonstrating that a dedicated year of training can achieve a higher number of procedures. However, it remains unclear as to what criteria can best be used to assess this competence.\nBased on the numeric procedure-log criteria suggested by ACCP and the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society, and procedural data from different surgical and procedural medical specialties, an arbitrary threshold number of procedures continues to be the prevalent way to assess procedural competence (4, 5, 8, 25 -28). Different health care systems and institutions mostly rely on number of procedures to grant practicing privileges (29). However, it is clear that learners achieve different levels of procedural expertise at the same ' threshold ' number, as demonstrated by Wahidi and colleagues (7, 8). Hence, we submit that the incorporation of objective tools, such as RIGID-TASC, can help standardize the assessment of competency in procedural operators.\nThe Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and the American Board of Medical Specialties have been actively engaged in developing objective methodologies to measure competence. There is a shift in the evaluation and accreditation of educational programs, away from education potential to outcomes and competence assessment, and the achievement of milestones (19, 30 -33). Milestones have been de /uniFB01 ned as knowledge, skills, attitudes, and other attributes for each of the ACGME competencies that describe the development of competence from an early learner, up to and beyond that expected for unsupervised practice (33).\nCompetency-based education requires that each competency be not only teachable and learnable, but also measurable (34). As opposed to processbased education, the competency-based paradigm demands that the effectiveness of any educational intervention be assessed and validated by the use of objective metrics, devised speci /uniFB01 cally to measure the acquired skills. Competency has been de /uniFB01 ned in the Miller pyramid as the ability gained from knowledge and skills, and it forms a basis for performance\n(24). Thus, by measuring the operators ' rigid bronchoscopy skills, we are in essence measuring the basis for their rigid bronchoscopy performance. Although ACGME does not currently accredit interventional pulmonology training programs, its recommendations can be adopted to improve interventional pulmonology educational outcomes. Development of tools, such as RIGIDTASC, can meet these goals (31).\nAn important /uniFB01 nding that warrants keen attention is that the mean score of the intermediate group was 78.15, which is less than the experts ' mean at 94.40, but was above the 75% mark. Is this good enough? We believe the answer is an emphatic ' no . ' This relative ceiling effect is commonly seen in tests designed for ' mastery testing ' (35 -39) (the use of the term ' mastery ' here should not be confused with its common usage, as in master of classical opera or master of renaissance literature). Mastery testing is a subtype of criterionreferenced testing, whereby we measure what proportion of a ' total criterion sum ' of knowledge and/or skills the learner has mastered, with the goal being as close as possible to the perfect 100%. This is the ideal testing paradigm for critical and high-risk procedures.\nThe rationale seems obvious: if a cardiac surgeon performs only 90% of the necessary steps of a coronary artery bypass grafting safely and effectively, the patient may never leave the surgical theater alive. Thus, in the mastery training and testing paradigm, the expected score is 100% or almost 100%. The ' almost ' is allowed for test-taking errors not re /uniFB02 ected in clinical practice. High-risk and highly invasive procedures, such as rigid bronchoscopy, are ideal for mastery training and testing, because every operator must master each and every constituent component of a complex procedure, without exception, to achieve competence and be able to perform it safely and effectively. At the end of training, the variable distinguishing different trainees is not the perfect /uniFB01 nal score, but how long it took to get there (i.e., the slope of the curve and not the peak) (40 -42).\nHigh-quality assessment methods can be based on van der Vleuten and Shuwirth ' s utility equation: utility = validity 3 reliability 3 acceptability 3 educational impact 3 cost effectiveness (43). Validity refers to whether an instrument actually\nmeasures what it purports to measure (31, 43). RIGID-TASC was able to successfully discriminate individuals at different level of experience and expertise. Reliability refers to the reproducibility of the scores obtained from an assessment (31, 43, 44). RIGIDTASC is simple and clear, which ensures that different scorers will interpret and use its items similarly. The high interrater reliability of RIGID-TASC means that different independent examiners will place an operator at a certain level of skill in the same score category.\nThe acceptability of an assessment method is generally improved with its impact on the desired outcome, its ease of administration, and cost. The educational impact of a tool derives from its ability to stimulate self-awareness and positive change, to improve knowledge and skill acquisition in the learner (31, 43). Deconstructing rigid bronchoscopy into its main constituent steps can help improve the consistency of training. It can be used for immediate, detailed, and objective feedback to the learner, thus leading to deliberate practice to remedy de /uniFB01 ciencies. Its use is simple for the instructor, hence disposing with the inherent heterogeneity and subjectivity of grading, thus facilitating its acceptance in a busy training program.\nThe need for objective competencybased assessment tools is further underscored by studies demonstrating the poor correlation between subjective faculty evaluations and standardized assessment scores (45, 46). Tools, such as RIGIDTASC, can be used by learners and instructors to veri /uniFB01 ably track and document the gradual acquisition of knowledge and skills, as well as to identify areas where improvements are needed. Instructors and program directors can use the results to ascertain the strengths, weaknesses, and educational value of their curricula.",

      "title": "Limitations",
      "content": "The primary limitation of this study is that the assessment of skills was performed on a manikin. The same approach has been used in development of other valid assessment tools, such as the BSTAT (13). Even when using a rigid bronchoscope with integrated telescope (Richard Wolf Medical Instruments Corp., Vernon Hills, IL), or in patients with endotracheal tube in place, most of the assessment points of RIGIDTASC can be used.\nPatient-based rigid bronchoscopy usually involves multiple complex therapeutic procedures, including tumor debridement, heat or cold therapy, and stent placement. Obviously, RIGID-TASC has not been designed to measure competence in these complex procedural skills. It is precisely designed to assess safe and effective rigid bronchoscopic intubation and central airway navigation. When learners in rigid bronchoscopy are objectively assessed as they progress along the spectrum, from novice to beginner to expert, a certain point is reached where each operator shows competence in the basic skills of rigid bronchoscopy: safe and atraumatic positioning , intubation , and central airway navigation . RIGID-TASC has been devised as an objective milestone for this level of competence. Training and assessment in all the other complex adjunct procedures (tumor resection, airway dilation, laser and other thermal treatments, stenting, etc.) will obviously need to follow acquisition of this basic level of competency.\nAnother limitation is that the rigid bronchoscope with 10-mm outer diameter was used for the testing, rather than the more commonly used 12-mm instrument. The 10-mm rigid bronchoscope was chosen, as the authors observed in pilot cases that most of the steps measured by the tool (such as assembly, patient positioning, protecting the lips and teeth, staying centered while navigating the airway, etc.) were not affected by the size of the bronchoscope. However, because the manikin airway (Nakhosteen Bronchoscopy Model) was originally designed for /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopy, passage of a 12-mm scope through the hard plastic vocal cords made rigid intubation of the manikin almost impossible for the novice and intermediate groups. However, the bene /uniFB01 t of using the 10-mm bronchoscope was uniform to all three groups. In the real-life patient, of course, an experienced operator ' s skills will not show a marked difference with the size of the bronchoscope.",
