      "content": "Spontaneous pneumothorax is classified as primary (PSP) in the absence of underlying lung disease and secondary (SSP) when it occurs in the setting of known lung disease (1). The most common underlying conditions in patients with SSP are emphysema, cystic fibrosis, infections, and malignancy (1).\nClinicians dealing with patients experiencing SSP are faced with two main treatment decisions: first, whether to drain the pneumothorax, and second, whether to perform a  definitive procedure to prevent further recurrences. However, approaches to the initial management of SSP\nhave significant practice variation, with marked differences between pulmonologists and thoracic surgeons (2). In patients with a large pneumothorax who are unstable, these treatment decisions are straightforward. However, in patients with SSP that are clinically stable and asymptomatic the approach varies, with differences arising among published guidelines and consensus statements (3,4).\nBritish Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines suggest drainage in the majority of patients with SSP , admission for at least 24 hours, and supplemental oxygen for those with small pneumothoraxes with low threshold for drainage (3).

By assessing risk factors associated with a MSSP recurrence, there is potential to identify patients who could benefit from early intervention intended to prevent recurrence.\nMethods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients with MSSP. The primary outcome was time to MSSP recurrence. We used a competing risk model to identify risk factors associated with MSSP recurrence.\nResults: A total of 2,532 patients were diagnosed with pneumothorax, with 114 having MSSP but only 96 were evaluable for the time-to-recurrence analysis. Of the 96 patients, 9 (9.4%) patients experienced recurrent MSSP, and 58 (60.4%) patients died during the study's follow-up period. The estimated cumulative incidence (CI) of MSSP considering death as a competing risk was 10.1% at 15 months. The univariable model identified the following covariates as associated with MSSP recurrence: mediastinal shift (Hazard ratio (HR) 12.30, 95% CI: 3.44-43.91, P<0.001), distance from lung apex to thoracic cupola (Hazard ratio (HR) 1.02, 95% CI: 1.00-1.03, P=0.003), and distance between visceral and chest wall at the hilum (Hazard ratio (HR) 1.02, 95% CI: 1.00-1.03, P=0.026). Conclusions: Although the incidence of MSSP recurrence was found to be low, clinical factors such as sarcoma, the associated mediastinal shift, greater distance from lung apex to thoracic cupola, greater distance between visceral and chest wall at the hilum were found to be risk factors for MSSP recurrence.\nPhysicians (ACCP) consensus advises hospitalization, with some panel members being against observation alone because of reports of deaths associated with this approach. Most members of the ACCP panel recommended an intervention after the first occurrence of SSP because of potential for mortality if another pneumothorax occurs (3-5).\nEvidence to support these recommendations is scarce and mainly derives from studies involving patients with SSP due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) or infections. Furthermore, although guidelines provide separate recommendations for special subgroups such as patients with cystic fibrosis, HIV-positive status, and pregnancy, SSP in patients with malignancy has not been addressed separately (3).\nCompared to other forms of SSP, malignancy-associated secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (MSSP) poses specific challenges due to limited life expectancy of patients (6-8). Additionally, pleural involvement can be significantly more extensive in MSSP than in other pneumothoraxes; therefore, optimal management strategies for MSSP may differ from other forms of SSP. Hence, the decision to perform a procedure in order to prevent further recurrences (e.g., talc pleurodesis) should be based on a careful consideration of the possibility of a second pneumothorax, how well tolerated the pneumothorax would be, and consideration of the competing risk of death given the limited life expectancy of these patients. A high probability of recurrence and/or the inability to tolerate recurrence would favor an aggressive strategy; while conversely, a low probability of a recurrent pneumothorax combined with good tolerance would favor a conservative strategy.\nThe primary objective of this study was to estimate the cumulative incidence (CI) and to identify risk factors\nassociated with MSSP recurrence. This will help inform clinician decision-making after a first MSSP, specifically whether or not to perform a definitive procedure aimed at preventing recurrence. If the risk of recurrence is high and patients will live long enough to have a recurrence that favors a definitive procedure at the time of first pneumothorax. The secondary objective was to identify risk factors associated with worsening MSSP requiring an intervention among patients who were initially treated with observation. Finally, we evaluated whether our institutional management matched ACCP and BTS guidelines.",

      "content": "Our primary outcome was time to recurrence of MSSP, measured as days from the diagnosis of the first pneumothorax to the day of diagnosis of the recurrent pneumothorax. Of note, for a recurrence to happen, the first pneumothorax must have resolved. Resolution was defined differently for patients who were in the observation only group as opposed to those whose initial treatment was in the invasive procedure group. In the observation only group, the pneumothorax was considered resolved at 15 days after diagnosis or upon evidence of pneumothorax resolution on imaging, whichever occurred first. This period of 15 days was chosen based on data indicating that total resolution of the pneumothorax occurs within 12 days in the presence of room air and can be accelerated by supplemental oxygen (9,10). In the invasive procedure group, the pneumothorax was considered resolved after chest tube removal with evidence of pneumothorax resolution on imaging. If a patient was in the observation only arm initially, and had to have an intervention, then time originated with removal of the chest tube.\nOur secondary outcome was to evaluate time to worsening of pneumothorax requiring an intervention in those patients in the observation only group in order to identify risk factors associated with worsening requiring an intervention. The observation time for this outcome was up to 15 days after the initial presentation of the MSSP; any intervention after that period was considered an\nintervention for a recurrence and not for treatment of the worsening MSSP.\nFinally, we evaluated whether our institutional management matched ACCP and BTS guidelines.",

(1999), accounting death as a competing risk for MSSP recurrence. We also use the subdistribution hazard model (Fine & Gray 1999) to estimate the CI for each patient given the baseline risk factors. Estimates of the subdistribution hazards ratio and 95% confidence interval were provided for all potential risk factors.\nWe used a cause-specific proportional hazard model to analyze time to worsening of pneumothorax, this model identifies risk factors associated with the hazard of pneumothorax worsening. A correlation analysis of all potential risk factors was conducted prior to specifying a full model consisting of covariates of interest. Variables with a P value of less than 0.20 on univariate analysis were considered candidate variables for multivariate regression models. Backward selection with a P value of <0.05 for covariate retention was used to arrive at a multivariable model.\nTo assess if our institutional management matched ACCP and BTS guidelines we performed a concordance analysis using McNemar's test.\nA two-tailed P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant for all analyses.

      "content": "This is the first study to develop a parsimonious model for time to pneumothorax recurrence in patients with evidence of MSSP. The recurrence rate was low and, of 96 patients, only 9 (9.4%) had a recurrence. The competing risk model showed that associated mediastinal shift, greater distance from lung apex to thoracic cupola, and greater distance between visceral and chest wall at the hilum were associated with a higher hazard of pneumothorax recurrence. In addition, compared to all other types of cancer, sarcoma type of cancer was associated with a significantly increased CI of MSSP recurrence (P=0.0011).\nFor the outcome of time to worsening in those patients initially observed, we identified multiple risk factors, but due to the sample size only shortness of breath was selected in the multivariate model. It is quite likely that if we had a larger sample size and hence more events we would identify other risk factors.\nThe low recurrence rate of MSSP (9.6%) observed in this study is in contrast to the recurrence rate of patients with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax due to other causes such as Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), who with conservative treatment have recurrence rates of 41% to 47% over 2 year. Due to the high recurrence rate and significant associated mortality, recommended treatment for patients with SSP due to Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is surgery after the first occurrence of SSP to prevent a potentially lethal event (11). However, surgical treatment for SSP is usually planned for patients who have well-preserved respiratory function and a good performance status. This was not the case in our study population with limited survival, and likely at risk for respiratory failure due to high disease burden.\nIn addition, clinicians have a heterogeneous approach to the management of spontaneous pneumothorax, and the ACCP and BTS have proposed different treatment recommendations (2,4,11,12). ACCP recommends that clinically stable patients with small pneumothorax be hospitalized, whereas BTS guidelines states that observation alone is recommended only in patients with small secondary pneumothoraxes of less than 1 cm depth or isolated apical pneumothoraxes in asymptomatic patients. Hospitalization is recommended in all cases (3,4). In our\nSHR, sub hazard ratio.\npatient population, only 84 (74%) of 114 patients were hospitalized for pneumothorax and in just about 60% of cases the ACCP and BTS guidelines were followed in respect to treating the pneumothorax with an intervention. This may be a reasonable approach, especially given that our study found that, in patients with MSSP treated with observation, worsening was seen in 21 (32%) of 65 patients\nand no patient died with this management strategy. In addition, ACCP and BTS guidelines recommend definitive intervention to prevent recurrence, but since the recurrence rate is low, we recommend against upfront definitive treatment, such as surgical intervention (pleurodesis), in this patient population.\nThis is the first study to use a Fine-Gray subdistribution",

Competing risks are particularly good for clinical prediction, compared with conventional Kaplan-Meier and Cox models, because when competing risks are present and occur with high frequency, the Kaplan-Meier survival function will consistently overestimate the crude incidence of the outcome of interest (13).\nWe recognize that our study has limitations such as the retrospective nature of data collection, which could have led to some misclassification bias (e.g., documentation may have failed to capture SOB that was present. Misclassification bias of this sort would favor the null hypothesis, so while our estimates of the Hazard ratio (HR) may be falsely low, the association is likely to be true. In addition, inaccuracies in billing\ndiagnoses could have led to bias in identifying all cases.\nIn conclusion, when MSSP presents, risk factors that predict worsening of the first MSSP requiring an intervention include: having sarcomas, presence of cavitary lung nodules, mediastinal contralateral shift, shortness of breath, higher respiratory rate, higher heart rate, greater distance from lung apex to thoracic cupola, and greater distance between visceral pleura and chest wall at hilum. After the first MSSP resolves, factors that increase the risk of having a recurrence include: contralateral mediastinal shift, distance from lung apex to thoracic cupola, and distance between visceral pleura, and chest wall at hilum. Knowing this will inform our decision as to whether a definitive intervention is used (e.g., talc pleurodesis). The overall incidence of a second MSSP was only 9.4% and median life expectancy was low. This suggests that conservative management strategies for MSSP are reasonable, and this is different than in other forms of SSP such as Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).",
