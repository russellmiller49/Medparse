    "abstract": "Rigid bronchoscopy and stenting is an additional skillset that should be obtained outside normal respiratory training. This is particularly seen in the United States where it is a separate fellowship and requires an additional year of dedicated training. However,inEurope,thereissignificantheterogeneity between health care systems and this needs addressing. Guidelines for lung cancer management recognize the central role of these techniques for a subgroup of patients who present with central airway compromise and associated symptoms. However, these techniques performed by skilled operators in the correct setting can significantly reduce symptoms and improve a patient's quality of life. The techniques are well-established within thoracic oncology but future efforts need to focus on standardization of techniques and ongoing training. 1. Becker HD, Marsh BR.

      "content": "For more than a century, rigid bronchoscopy has been used as both a diagnostic and therapeutic tool in complex airways disease. With the emergence of interventional pulmonology (IP) as a specific subspecialty within respiratory medicine, there has been renaissance in its use and, for many interventional pulmonologists, it occupies a central position in the management of both malignant and benign complex airway disorders. Indeed, despite the development of new techniques, for both diagnostic and therapeutic applications, many physicians still use the rigid bronchoscope as a mainstay of the procedure.\nIn the hands of experienced proceduralists, patients can be offered definitive disease management in a safe, controlled environment using minimally invasive techniques. Its use allows direct access to the airway in a controlled manner and facilitates several treatment modalities, not exclusively including stent placement, endobronchial laser therapy, cryotherapy, electrocautery, argon plasma coagulation, and photodynamic therapy. Despite the development of new technologies, rigid bronchoscopy remains an invaluable skill. However, adequate training and knowledge of the procedure is vital in safely addressing central airway disease complications.

      "title": "BACKGROUND",
      "content": "Father of modern bronchoscopy is the title given to Gustav Killian, an otolaryngologist from Freiberg, Germany. Killian is credited with the invention of the rigid bronchoscope and with describing the potential therapeutic indications. The first reported procedure was the removal of a pork bone from the right main bronchus of a farmer using a rigid esophagoscope in 1876. He then went on to describe the successful removal of foreign bodies from the airways in 3 separate cases. 1,2 In the paper 'Direckte Endoskope der Luft-und Speisewege,' published in 1915, Bru ¨ nings and colleagues 3 reported a success rate for foreign body removal of 98.3%, with failure to extract the aspirated material in only 12 out of 701 cases. This was a significant advance in the management of a condition with a known 50% mortality before the rigid bronchoscopy era.\nDuring this new era of 'direct bronkoscopie,' as coined by Killian, Chevalier Jackson, 4 based in America, was gaining recognition for his use of rigid bronchoscopy to remove foreign bodies from both children and adults. 5 The Mutter museum in Philadelphia displays 2374 objects recovered by Dr Jackson during his nearly 75years-long career. 4 Jackson also began to expand the role of rigid bronchoscopy and pioneered endobronchial treatment of tuberculosis complications. He was also the first to report endoluminal mechanical resection of endobronchial tumors.\nAdvances in technology in the latter decades of the twentieth century, especially with the emergence of fiberoptic imaging and bronchoscopy, significantly affected the way physicians undertook airway inspection. This ultimately resulted in the introduction of the flexible bronchoscope; with a thoracic surgeon from Japan, Shigeto Ikeda, credited with its development in 1962. The first commercially useful instrument was presented at Copenhagen in 1966 6 and, with some additional modifications and adoption of the working channel, the Machida flexible bronchoscope became commercially available in 1968. 5 With an increase in the popularity of the flexible bronchoscope due in part to the obvious advantages (minimally invasive, absence of need for general anesthesia, and superiority in visualizing smaller peripheral airways), there was a notable decrease in the use of rigid bronchoscopy over the 2 decades that followed. Training availability in this method became a rarity and its use became\nalmost obsolete except for several dedicated physicians, particularly in Europe.\nThese physicians continued to explore its role in airway disease. Airway laser via a rigid bronchoscope was first described in 1981 by Lucien Toty and colleagues. 7 However, its refinement and central role in accepted standards of practice was attributed to Dr Jean Francois Dumon who is seen as the father of modern day rigid bronchoscopy and stenting. The term stent is credited to Charles Stent who developed the first custommade mold of teeth in the nineteenth century. However, he was not to know that his name would become synonymous with this cornerstone of modern day medicine. 5 Over the last 30 years, stents have evolved from experimental interventions to essential components in many fields of medicine and surgery, including cardiology, vascular medicine, urology, otolaryngology, and pulmonology. Literature case reports of stent deployment go back as far as 1915. However, it was not until the development of the Montgomery T-tube in the sixties 8 and, more importantly, the major breakthrough that occurred with Dumon's 9 development of a dedicated silicone stent for the trachea and bronchi in the mid-1980s, that stent use became standard. The first airway stent was placed in Marseille, France, in 1985. With these 2 developments, stenting became an integral part of the management of airway compromise caused by benign and malignant conditions.\nWith these advances in central airway management, treatment options became available for patients with both benign and malignant airway conditions. Tumor debulking with laser and stent placement in selected patients became standards in practice, offering immediate and lasting symptomatic relief and palliation of central airway obstruction in malignant disease. Rigid bronchoscopy had regained its vital role in IP, offering options to both surgical and nonsurgical candidates. However, current practices are once again changing, particularly those related to stent placement.",

      "title": "CURRENT ROLE OF RIGID BRONCHOSCOPY",
      "content": "Rigid bronchoscopy maintains a central role in advanced airway management. It serves both malignant and benign diseases. The rigid bronchoscope allows stabilization of compromised airways, treatment of palliative endobronchial disease, and treatment of nonsurgical candidates with benign conditions. More recently, it supports newer endobronchial techniques. This has resulted in the growth of IP as a specific subspecialty in respiratory medicine. 10\nThe rigid bronchoscope is an invaluable tool in interventional bronchoscopy. 11-13 It allows, with maximal safety and under general anesthesia, adequate ventilation of the patient through a side port; efficient suctioning of blood, secretions, pus, and smoke via large suction catheters; and the use of accessory instruments (eg, laser probes, cryoprobes, rigid forceps). 14 These features were clearly documented in the recent British Thoracic Society guideline for advanced diagnostic and therapeutic flexible bronchoscopy in adults, which described that 'Rigid bronchoscopic procedures under general anaesthesia combine the ability to maintain adequate ventilation, to remove large volume tumour and safely control large volume haemorrhage.' 15\nIt also allows therapeutic interventions, such as dilatation of stenoses or extrinsic compression, and mechanical coring and debulking of endoluminal tumors, using the distal bevel to rapidly recanalize the airway. 16 In addition, a foreign body can safely be removed using the rigid forceps. The rigid bronchoscope is the instrument of choice in cases of acute respiratory failure secondary to endoluminal obstruction because it allows for a rapid procedure while maintaining airway patency and adequate ventilation. A rigid bronchoscope is required for silicone stent placement using a dedicated rigid loading system.\nThe procedure has many advantages compared with the flexible scope. Treatment of central airway obstruction with a flexible bronchoscope alone is not generally recommended, particularly in the case of tracheal lesions. Its small working channel may not be sufficient to prevent airway flooding in case of massive bleeding. The flexible biopsy forceps have a small diameter and can only sample or debulk small tumoral fragments, leading to long and fastidious procedures. 5 In an attempt to overcome this, metallic snares or baskets have been developed to remove larger pieces of tumors or foreign bodies. 14",

      "title": "SPECIFIC INDICATIONS Malignant Airway Obstruction",
      "content": "Malignant central airways disease with obstruction is the main indication for endobronchial intervention, with bronchogenic carcinoma accounting for between 74% and 100% of patients in large cases series. 17-24 Classic literature reports obstruction occurring in up to 20% of patients with bronchogenic carcinoma, with up to 40% developing complications over the course of their disease. Brewer's 25 1977 case series of 359 subjects (defined by chest radiograph), reported 20.3% (16.3%-24.9%) having central airways\ninvolvement at presentation and a further 49.1% (43.7%-54.3%) having lobar bronchial involvement. A recent review of index computed tomography scans in patients presenting consecutively with a new diagnosis of lung cancer to a UK hospital found that endobronchial disease was reported in 29% (95% CI 24.4-33.5), with a total of 7.6% (95% CI 4.9-10.2) of patients having involvement of a central airway. 26 This differs considerably from the historical literature but still represents a significant burden of disease, which may go neglected in centers without access to interventional pulmonologists. Such patients are recognized as having a poor outcome, 27 whereas intervention can lead to improvements in performance status, quality of life, and physiologic measures. 28-30 Chhajed and colleagues 31 demonstrated no difference in survival between those with malignancy receiving chemotherapy but without central airway obstruction (median survival 8.4 months) compared with the subjects who underwent successful airway recanalization by means of laser (25%), stent (25%), or both (50%), followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (median survival 8.2 months P 5 .395).\nCavaliere and colleagues 17,18 reported on more than 3000 cases over 15 years, and consistently found most benefit in airway debulking is obtained in the larger airways, rather than lobar regions. These larger airways (trachea, main bronchi, and bronchus intermedius) were successfully treated in 85% to 97% of cases, whereas good outcomes in patients with lobar involvement were recorded in approximately 60%. Rigid bronchoscopy has been the preference over the past 30 years, which is reflected in the recent AQuIRE registry (American College of Chest Physicians Quality Improvement Registry, Evaluation, and Education) in which rigid bronchoscopes were used in 65.7% of cases. 24 Flexible bronchoscopy has been a universal skill among pulmonologists who benefit from its ease of use in awake to moderately sedated patients, obviating an anesthetist. In the AQuIRE registry, flexible bronchoscopy was performed in the context of a general anesthetic and moderate sedation was recognized as a risk factor for complications. The rigid scope is most suited to larger airways, and success is likely related to the scale of debulking that can be achieved, whereas combination with a flexible scope allows the full spectrum of treatment modalities.\nTo support this kind of treatment, the literature is understandably restricted to case series from large centers where skill sets have evolved, patient selection refined, and cohorts are nonrepresentative of the wider populations that suffer with such endobronchial disease. Given that oncologic\ntreatments do not generally result in prompt improvement in patients' symptoms, endoscopic treatments are necessary adjuncts to the tailored management of patients at all stages of disease (neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and palliative). In addition, bronchial obstruction-related complications (atelectasis, respiratory insufficiency or distress, or repeated infections) are likely to interfere with optimal oncologic treatments, such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy.\nAirway involvement can be intrinsic, limited to endoluminal involvement, an extrinsic compression, or a mixed condition with both tumor within the airway (ie, intrinsic) and external compression of the airway (ie, extrinsic).\nIn principle, purely intrinsic involvement can often be managed with debulking techniques to remove the endoluminal tumor. The rigid bronchoscope is then the instrument of choice. Three steps can be described. The first is coagulation and devascularization of the tumor, the second is\nmechanical coring, and the third is coagulation of the tumoral base. This technique is called laserassisted mechanical debulking (or electrocautery, or argon plasma) ( Fig. 1 ). On occasion, a stent may be placed as a bridge to chemoradiotherapy or alternatively may be considered as a permanent solution when the risk of local recurrence is high. Extrinsic compression without intraluminal disease is readily treated with dilation followed by stenting. Mixed (intrinsic and extrinsic) obstruction is usually managed with both debulking and stent insertion. Usually, the benefits noted after successful bronchoscopic treatment of obstruction last for 2 to 3 months. 32 Benefit duration after stent placement is generally reported to be around 4 months before tumoral stent overgrowth, 33 but this duration can be increased with the use of effective oncologic treatments (ie, chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy).\nOther indications for endobronchial treatment include endobronchial metastases (eg, esophageal,\nthyroid, renal cell carcinoma, colon, and melanoma) or, alternatively, low-grade primary tumors (eg, adenoid cystic carcinomas, typical or atypical carcinoids).\nIn most cases, rigid bronchoscopy results in rapid recanalization of the airway and maintenance of patency, often in combination with other techniques such as stent placement. In turn, this results in rapid relief of symptoms and improved quality of life for patients. A retrospective study has shown that rigid bronchoscopy and mechanical debulking as a sole therapy is safe and successful in up to 83% of cases of central airway tumors. 34",

      "title": "Removal of Foreign Bodies",
      "content": "Eighty percent of foreign body aspirations occur in children and is frequently accidental due to developing children putting objects in the mouth. In contrast, aspiration in the adult population is often associated with impairment of consciousness or swallowing. 11,12 The use of rigid bronchoscopy versus flexible bronchoscopy has been debated for years. 13,16,35 Flexible bronchoscopy can be used for the diagnosis and extraction of foreign bodies, which may be removed using forceps, snares, or baskets. It is more accessible and less expensive, and a general anesthetic is not required. However, rigid bronchoscopy remains the procedure of choice for asphyxiating foreign bodies because it offers superior airway control, suction, and extraction capabilities. 36 The risks of large-volume bleeding and flexible bronchoscope migration are real and need to be considered before attempting removal. As highlighted previously, this often involves using a combination of rigid and flexible bronchoscopes to ensure a safer and more complete single procedure.\nIn cases in which the foreign body is rounded, a smooth forceps is preferred. This allows for grasping of the largest volume of the flexible bronchoscope under direct visualization, taking care not to further advance the flexible bronchoscope down the airway. An important practice point in these cases is to remove the rigid bronchoscope and the forceps along with the extracted flexible bronchoscope en bloc ( Fig. 2 ). In comparison, for sharp or irregular objects, a flexible bronchoscope and an alligator forceps are preferred. Depending on the clinical scenario, different techniques may be adopted by the proceduralist; often these are locally developed techniques. An example of this is using the Trendelenburg position while extracting heavy metallic flexible bronchoscopes. Finally, if the flexible bronchoscope is\nlost on removal, it is important to closely inspect the oral cavity and larynx before reintubation with a rigid bronchoscope. 14",

      "title": "Hemoptysis",
      "content": "Airway hemorrhage can be a rapidly fatal condition. The risk of mortality depends on several factors, including the volume and rate of hemoptysis, underlying respiratory status, and associated comorbidities. Regardless of the treatment modality, there are high rates of morbidity and mortality. In stable patients who have minimal hemoptysis, bronchoscopy can diagnose the cause specifically and be used as the primary treatment modality. 37 The main disadvantages of using a fiberoptic bronchoscope include the small aspiration channel, which is easily obstructed with blood and clots; difficult endoscopic observation due to the lens being frequently obscured by blood; and inadequate pulmonary ventilation. 38 In the event of large-volume or life-threatening hemoptysis, it is imperative to use a rigid bronchoscope. The broad internal diameter allows good endoscopic vision throughout the procedure, controlled ventilation, and access of equipment for timely aspiration of blood and clots, along with selective lung intubation if necessary. 38 A further advantage to using the rigid bronchoscope is that the scope itself can be used to effectively tamponade a visible bleeding vessel and control further blood loss. Once the rigid bronchoscope is in situ with the contralateral protected lung, there are several methods available to the physician to control the\nbleeding, including cold saline lavage, argon plasma coagulation, laser photocoagulation, electrocautery, which are all safe and easily applied via rigid bronchoscopy. Overall, the rigid bronchoscope is a safe and effective tool in the management of hemoptysis and, on review of the literature, boasts an 85% to 100% success rate in identifying the site of hemorrhage. 38-43 Unfortunately, bronchoscopists are not always present in the event of these cases; moreover, if present, may not be adequately trained in the skill of rigid bronchoscopy.",

      "title": "Benign Airway Stenosis",
      "content": "There are many causes of acquired benign tracheal stenosis; the most common are tracheal intubation and posttracheostomy. 44,45 Other rarer causes include previous upper airway surgery, inhalational injury, and autoimmune conditions; for example, sarcoid, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, previously known as Wegener granulomatosis or systemic lupus erythematous. 46 In this small cohort of patients, multidisciplinary team involvement is essential to determine the choice of therapy.\nIn many patients, the obstruction will be amenable to surgical resection; however, this may not always lead to superior outcomes. Important considerations include the available radiological imaging, patient lung function and comorbidities, rates of recurrence, and scarring at surgical sites. Endoscopic resection with rigid bronchoscopy can lead to immediate symptom resolution along with excellent local control of stenosis using a host of techniques, including balloon bronchoplasty, stent placement, argon plasma coagulation, cryotherapy, and so forth. 47 The choice of technique is often made based on physician preference, available techniques, and equipment. In addition, the type of stenosis is important ( Fig. 3 ).\nA tracheal stenosis may be classified as simple or complex. A simple stenosis involves the mucosa alone, whereas a complex stenosis is associated with cartilage instability. In the setting of a simple stenosis, the stenosis should be radially incised in 3 locations before serial dilatation with the rigid bronchoscope. In the scenario of a simple stenosis, a tracheal stent may not be required; however, a complex stenosis frequently requires stenting to stabilize the airway. Benign stenoses at the level of the main bronchi (eg, after sleeve lobectomy, transplantation) can be more difficult to dilate. The stenosis is often extremely tight and may require the use of a balloon or pediatric rigid scopes for the first dilatation. For example, simple\nstenosis without cartilage damage will often resolve after 2 to 3 dilatations without stent insertion. This is less likely in cases with a complex stenosis in which stents may be needed to maintain patency. Kajiwara and colleagues 48 demonstrated complete symptomatic resolution after bronchoscopic intervention using a combination of up to 3 modalities in 4 subjects. This effect was maintained for a period ranging from 51 to 112 months. In selecting appropriate patients, treatment of benign airway stenosis can be minimally invasive, reproducible, and highly effective.\nIn addition, benign endobronchial tumors can be managed with good effect using rigid bronchoscopy. 49-51 Good indications for endoscopic treatment include tumors in which the distal margins can be endoscopically evaluated and in which the tumor is located within the tracheobronchial tree (as far as subsegmental bronchi). In addition, pedunculated lesions are probably best treated because the endoscopist can clearly see removal of the lesion and can treat the bed of the tumor at the end of the procedure. Finally, complete treatment is not possible if there is extramural tumor invasion. It is also important to stress that, in rare cases, recurrence or malignant transformation can occur even after resection. Therefore, careful periodic observation of the resection stump with the flexible bronchoscope is mandated.",

      "content": "Fistula formation between the esophagus and main airways (trachea or main bronchi) can be a devastating complication of esophageal disease and results in significant morbidity and mortality for patients, including chemical pneumonitis from airway spillage and pulmonary infections. It is\ngenerally agreed that a fistula should be closed but the optimal method for performing this intervention remains under debate. It is unclear if this should be done with an esophageal stent, a tracheal stent, or both. 52\nPhysicians must be aware and assess for possible respiratory compromise by extrinsic airway compression from an exophytic esophageal lesion. A patient with respiratory symptoms before esophageal stent insertion should have an airway stent inserted before esophageal stenting. In addition, in cases in which a residual fistula remains despite an optimally placed esophageal stent, patients may require double stenting with a second airway stent. In all other cases, the authors advocate commencing with a single esophageal stent and assessing for persistence of fistula or development of respiratory symptoms secondary to ongoing airway spillage.\nSurgical dehiscence and airway lacerations in patients unfit to undergo surgical repair may also be treated with airway stenting. Airway lacerations in patients not requiring positive pressure ventilation will heal spontaneously and do not require stenting. 53",

      "title": "EQUIPMENT, TECHNIQUE, AND ANESTHESIA",
      "content": "Although the rigid bronchoscope is available in various types and sizes, the basic concept is the\nsame: a solid tube that is open at each end with side holes along the distal end of the scope. The various lengths and diameters range from 5 mm to 13.5 mm. The barrel wall is 2 to 3 mm thick and the internal diameter is uniform throughout. The latter enables ventilation to the contralateral lung when working on an obstructing lesion in the ipsilateral main bronchus. 54 The tracheoscope is shorter in length compared with the bronchoscope and has no ventilation slits. Fig. 4 is a typical diagrammatic representation of a rigid bronchoscope and its components. Multiple ports on the proximal end of the bronchoscope allows for the attachment of various ventilation devices and ancillary tools, such as suctioning tubes to aspirate blood, secretions, pus, and smoke, and easy introduction of ancillary instruments; for example, laser probes, cryoprobes, and rigid forceps. 14,55 In addition, the design of the rigid bronchoscope itself allows for rapid recanalization of obstructed airways using its distal bevel to core and debulk tumors, the so-called core-out or corkscrew technique.\nCurrent indications for rigid bronchoscopy include removal of a foreign body, hemostasis and clot removal in hemoptysis, relief of central airway obstruction from benign or malignant conditions, stent placement, and endoluminal therapies. 54 In addition, the procedure can play a central role in modern airway procedures, such\nJet ventilation\nas valve or coil placement, and controlled assessment of collateral ventilation. Treatment of many of these conditions is not considered safe nor feasible using flexible bronchoscopy alone and, currently, the therapeutic capabilities of the flexible bronchoscope are deemed to be inferior to those of rigid bronchoscopy. 56 However, rigid bronchoscopy and flexible bronchoscopy work as complementary techniques with many bronchoscopists using the flexible scope via the rigid tube. It is an important tool with easy maneuverability that allows exploration and clearing of peripheral airways, examination of more distal airways, and inspection of segments lateral to the central airways. In addition, it is the only tool available for the management of upper lobe obstruction owing to the inherent flexible characteristics of the scope. 14\nRigid bronchoscopy, unlike the flexible procedure, requires general anesthesia. This may have an impact on the availability and growth of the procedure despite the many inherent advantages of the rigid procedure (see later discussion). There are various options for providing general anesthesia, although, in principle, most units have developed their own protocols that are acceptable to the anesthetist and physician alike. The procedure brings a unique set of issues, particularly the sharing of the airway between the 2 specialities. 57,58\nIn general, anesthesia can be administered intravenously or by inhalation. Intravenous options are usually preferred and, in particular, targetcontrolled total intravenous anesthesia is often selected in many units. Inhalational techniques are less commonly used because the rigid tube is an open system and this can lead to operating room pollution. Ventilation techniques that can be used include spontaneous ventilation, spontaneous assisted ventilation, jet ventilation, highfrequency ventilation, or rarely used (although described) closed-circuit positive-pressure ventilation.\nAfter the induction of anesthesia, the patient's head is partially extended and the bronchoscope is inserted in the midline, with the bevel anterior. The operator's finger or a plastic tooth protector protects the upper teeth. The bronchoscope is advanced to and passed under the epiglottis and then rotated 90 /C14 so that it can be passed through the vocal cords without injury and into the upper trachea ( Figs. 5, 6 ).\nTo enter 1 side of the bronchial tree, the patient's head is rotated toward the contralateral shoulder. When using a tracheoscope, the physician can initially intubate with the largest caliber tube, thus allowing thinner diameter\nbronchoscope barrels, which can be inserted through the lumen of the tracheoscope. There is, therefore, no need to remove the latter or to reintubate the patient. A flexible bronchoscope can also be passed through the lumen of the rigid bronchoscope to allow inspection of distal airways. As mentioned previously, IP physicians who favor the rigid scope do not use this technique exclusively and recognize the importance of ancillary techniques and the central role of the flexible scope during a procedure. The flexible scope is essential for airway toileting and specimen collection.",

Other manufacturers of rigid bronchoscopy equipment include the TEXAS Rigid Integrated Bronchoscope (Richard Wolf, Knittlingen, Germany), the Karl Storz rigid bronchoscope (Tuttlingen, Germany), and the Dutau-Novatech rigid bronchoscope (Novatech, La Ciotat, France). Illumination in modern rigid bronchoscopes is provided by a xenon light source with a prismatic light deflector that is attached proximally to allow full use of the bronchoscope lumen. A rigid telescope is passed through the central opening of the bronchoscope barrel. The bronchoscopist can either look down the eyepiece of the telescope, or a chargecoupled chip video camera can be connected to the eyepiece for visualization on a monitor. This also allows the physician to record procedures.\nMost physicians only need to use a direct view rigid telescope because the flexible bronchoscope\nnegates the use of angled telescopes to assess lateral to the central airways or view and treat lesions in the upper lobes. The Texas rigid bronchoscope is the first fully integrated rigid bronchoscope with a semiflexible endoscope inside. The benefit of the Texas system is the full inner lumen of the rigid bronchoscope.

In addition, stents can be grouped into straight, bifurcating (Y-stents), and T-tubes. Silicone stents require rigid bronchoscopy for deployment, whereas metallic stents can be placed with either a rigid or flexible bronchoscope, according to the physician's preference.\nThe main purpose of tracheal and bronchial stents is to restore patency of the airway. Any symptomatic endoluminal pathological complication associated with a significant reduction in airway luminal diameter (greater than 50%) may be an indication for an airway stent if the patient is symptomatic secondary to the obstruction.\nFive major indications have been established:\n1. Extrinsic compression from tumors or lymph nodes\n2. Stabilization of airway patency after endoscopic resection of intraluminal cancer\n3. Treatment of benign strictures\n4. Stabilization of collapsing airways (malacia and polychondritis)\n5. Treatment of fistulas (eg, stump dehiscences, tracheoesophageal fistulas).",

The gold standard stent remains the Dumon stent (Tracheobronxane, Novatech, La Ciotat, France). These prostheses are the most widely used stents worldwide. They are made from silicone with studs on the external surface. These studs prevent migration and reduce mucosal ischemia by limiting contact with the airway wall. The stents are available in a wide range of sizes and diameters (up to 18 mm in external diameter and 60 mm in length). This ensures that the stent can be sized to the required length to encompass the stenosis and 0.5 cm of normal mucosa above and below the stenosis. This minimizes the length of the stent and assists clearance of secretions and patient tolerance. The rims of each stent are polished to reduce the risk of granuloma formation. In addition, recent advances include radiopaque studs. The Dumon Gold Studded Stent (Novatech, La Ciotat, France) improves radiographic visualization. The Dumon silicone stent is also available in a Y-design for disease at the level of the carina. Unlike the straight stent, the Y-stent is more difficult to place correctly and requires a significant amount of time to position across the carina using rigid grasping forceps. In addition, hourglass stents are available that are particularly suitable for benign stenosis. Another commercially available silicone stent is the Polyflex stent (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA). This stent is made from polyethylene threads built into the silicone. The stent may adapt better to an hourglass stenosis when compared with the Dumon silicone stent; however, it has a higher migration rate because it is more easily compressed than the Dumon stent. Other silicone stents, such as the Hood stent (Hood Laboratories, Pembroke, MA, USA) and the Noppen stent (MTW, Essen, Germany), are no longer commercially available. All silicone stents require rigid bronchoscopy for placement.\nFinally, dynamic stents are also available. These have a flexible posterior wall, which mimics the posterior wall of the trachea. This may improve secretion clearance.",

The 3-limb design allows recanalization of the airway without risk of migration because the stent is anchored via the limb exiting the stoma. This limb can be closed to allow speaking.

As previously discussed, stenting should be viewed as a palliative procedure and, in most cases, should be the last therapeutic option. For example, in the setting of benign tracheal stenosis, surgical resection is the preferred treatment. However, this may not be possible and an airway stent should be assessed as a treatment choice. It is preferable that these procedures are planned and that the patient is reviewed in clinic before undertaking the intervention. This allows optimization of the medical condition and review of all available imaging. In addition, the anesthetist can assess the patient and optimize any reversible conditions. However, these procedures often occur in an emergent setting and are, therefore, often performed with minimal preassessment. It is the opinion of the authors that all therapeutic airway procedures should be performed with a rigid scope passed into the airway to ensure patency with adequate ventilation. If procedures are performed\nwith a flexible bronchoscope, we strongly advise that an adult bronchoscope with a large working channel (minimum 2.8-3.2 mm) is used to allow adequate suctioning, delivery of laser probes, balloon dilators, and optimal aspiration. Larger stent delivery catheters should be introduced under fluoroscopy after placing external radiopaque markers.",

Our preference is for a silicone stent and rigid bronchoscopy ( Fig. 7 ). As stated in the British Thoracic Society (BTS) guideline, this allows airway stability, adequate ventilation, and rapid control of hemorrhage and clot removal. 15\nIn addition, the silicone stent is easily customized and its position can be adjusted with ease after deployment. Finally, a silicone stent can be removed with ease if the clinical situation dictates ( Fig. 8 ). In the authors' units, a SEMS is used when there is a distorted airway with excessive tortuosity. In these situations, the silicone stent does not\nconform to the airway anatomy and, if placed, often results in kinking with ongoing airway stenosis and a high risk of complications. The SEMS more easily conforms to this type of airway. In\naddition, a conical SEMS is particularly useful in cases in which the diameter of the airway varies from distal to the proximal extremity ( Fig. 9 ). However, unlike the recommendation of the BTS\nguideline, when placing a SEMS, our preference is to use rigid bronchoscopy and intubation. Once a decision is made to place a stent, the length of stenosis and required diameter needs to be measured. This can be performed with dedicated measuring forceps. The required stent size is estimated from the diameter of the rigid tube and the length can be measured using a flexible bronchoscope. The size of the stent should exceed the size of the stenosis by 1 cm, which allows 0.5 cm of clearance at the distal and proximal margin ( Fig. 10 ). The stent should be larger than the stenosis so that there is adequate radial force to keep the prosthesis in position. Only experienced bronchoscopists who can respond and manage both the early and late complications of advanced airway disease should place stents.",

      "title": "CURRENT STENTING LANDSCAPE",
      "content": "In the early years of stent placement there was probably an overuse of this technique and, like all technologies, indications have become more defined over the last 2 decades. In addition, lung cancer presentation has changed with a decrease in central diseases and an increase in peripheral cancers. Moreover, physicians have become more aware of stent complications and most centers will follow the premise that stents should only be placed as a last resort when all other therapeutic options have been explored. In the scenario in which the lumen caliber is adequate after debulking, a stent should not be placed ( Fig. 11 ). The Marseille group 66 has recently published their experience and highlighted the overall decrease in stent deployment over the last 3 decades. Examples of the changing landscape for stenting can be seen in all aspects of airway disease.\nIn benign tracheal stenosis, the initial practice as performed in most centers was to initially treat most cases by stent placement. Evidence does support that stenting tracheal stenosis can result in a high rate of success but it is also associated with complications and requires ongoing longterm management. In current practice, stenting in benign stenosis is reserved for patients in whom surgical or anesthetic contraindications preclude surgical intervention, which represents a small percentage of patients. As far as malignant obstruction is concerned, the Silicone Prosthesis in Obstructive lung Cancer (SPOC) trial has redefined the role of stenting. 67 This study concluded that a stent is only required as a palliative treatment when initial primary oncology treatments have proven insufficient. Historically, the management of a trachea-esophageal fistula was with double stenting (esophageal and tracheal or bronchial stents). This practice has also changed in recent years with a significant decrease in double stenting, which is reserved for cases of persisting aspiration or symptomatic secondary compression of the airway after esophageal stenting.",

In the United States, a large number of centers now offer dedicated IP fellowships but surveys performed in the past have demonstrated that it is difficult to obtain adequate numbers of procedures to ensure competence in the rigid bronchoscopy technique. In the United States, 31.3% of pulmonary programs have an IP service; however, rigid bronchoscopy training is offered in only 4.4% of these practices. 76\nArecently completed survey by the European Association of Bronchology and Interventional Pulmonology (EABIP), 77 submitted for publication has demonstrated a significant heterogeneity of IP services around Europe. Dedicated programs need to bedeveloped to allow for further growth and sharing of knowledge in Europe. The National Institute of\nClinical Excellence (NICE) guideline CG121 recommended that all cancer centers should ensure that patients have rapid access to a team capable of providing interventional endobronchial treatments, and the advantages of the rigid bronchoscopy procedure were documented in the BTS guideline on therapeutic procedures. 15,77\nThe guideline recommended that patients with central airway obstruction due to intraluminal tumor should have endobronchial tumor debulking considered. However, despite documenting the advantages of the rigid bronchoscopy procedure, as described previously, they recommended that a laryngeal mask or uncuffed endotracheal tube be used to achieve airway control. This will have a major impact on the growth of the procedure within the United Kingdom and, indeed, our recent survey 78 seems to support this conclusion.\nFinally, a recent American College of Chest Physicians publication has suggested standards for accreditation of IP fellowships in the United States. 79 It recommends a curriculum for a standard IP program. The program should be set over a 12month curriculum with at least 9 months devoted to direct IP training. In addition, there should be\nample exposure to associated specialties, including but not limited to thoracic surgery and otolaryngology. Appropriate research should also be undertaken. Finally, they set out guidelines for the minimum institutional volumes necessary for accreditation of an IP fellowship program. Ongoing standardization of practice within Europe and the United States will further cement the position of IP as a subspecialty in respiratory medicine.",

The authors think that good technique, including selection of stent size and type, can assist in reducing complications.
