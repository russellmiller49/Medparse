The quality of evidence was low for five of the seven outcomes (very low N = 1, moderate N = 1) and there was heterogeneity among the studies. There was a variety of adult participants and the procedures were performed by a wide range of differently experienced operators in different situations.\nThere was no evidence of a difference in the rate of the primary outcomes: mortality directly related to the procedure (Peto odds ratio (POR) 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.10 to 2.60, I$^{2} = 44%, P = 0.42, 4 studies, 257 participants, low quality evidence); and serious, life-threatening adverse events - intraoperatively: risk ratio (Relative risk (RR)) 0.93, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.53, I$^{2} = 27%, P = 0.78, 12 studies, 1211 participants, low quality evidence,and direct postoperatively: Relative risk (RR) 0.72, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.25, I$^{2} = 24%, P = 0.24, 10 studies, 984 participants, low quality evidence.\nPTs significantly reduce the rate of the secondary outcome, wound infection/stomatitis by 76% (Relative risk (RR) 0.24, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.37, I$^{2} = 0%, P < 0.00001, 12 studies, 936 participants, moderate quality evidence) and the rate of unfavourable scarring by 75% (Relative risk (RR) 0.25, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.91, I$^{2} = 86%, P = 0.04, 6 studies, 789 participants, low quality evidence).

The resulting opening between the trachea and the outer air space (stoma, tracheostomy) allows the person to breathe when the usual route for breathing is somehow obstructed or impaired. Tracheostomy is also necessary for persons in an ICU who are being ventilated by a machine for a long time (i.e. weeks). It is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures in intensive care medicine. Both surgical techniques (surgical opening of the trachea) and percutaneous techniques (opening of the trachea with plastic dilators) are widely used in current practice.

      "content": "Tracheostomy formation is one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures in the critically ill intensive care patient who requires  long-term  mechanical  ventilation  (Cools-Lartigue  2013; Durbin 2010; Kollef 1999; Wood 1996). Translaryngeal intubation is the preferred artificial airway for initial use in the mechanicallyventilated  patient  but  known  benefits  from  tracheostomy  are less need for deeper sedation, shorter weaning time, and shorter intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay. With a few exceptions, there is no difference in mortality with  a  tracheostomy  or continued  prolonged  translaryngeal  intubation  (Caruso  1997; Durbin 2010; Kane 1997; Wood 1996) (see Table 1). While prolonged respiratory  failure  is  probably  the  most  common  reason  for performing  tracheostomy,  other  indications  such  as  decreased level of consciousness, poor airway protective reflexes, and severe alterations  in  physiology  associated  with  trauma  and  medical illness are also indications for tracheostomy. Airway accidents may be more frequent and more severe in patients with tracheostomy tubes, and safety should modulate the decision to move a patient from an ICU (Durbin 2010).\nTraditionally,  tracheostomy  has  been  performed  by  surgeons or otolaryngologists in the operating room using standard surgical principles. Open tracheostomy has a number of possible complications including the loss of the airway, injuries to nearby  structures,  bleeding,  pneumothorax,  tracheoinnominate fistula, infection, and tracheal stenosis (Chew  1972;  Durbin 2010;  Hazard  1988;  Heffner  1986b;  Heffner  1988;  Mulder  1969; Paul  1989;  Stauffer  1981).  Previous  reports  have  documented complication  rates  associated  with  tracheostomy  that  vary  from 6%  to  66%  and  mortality  rates  ranging  from  0%  to  5%  (Chew 1972; Friedman 1996b; Heffner 1986b; Skaggs 1969; Stauffer 1981; Stock  1986).  There  have  been  many  attempts  to  reduce  the number  of  complications  associated  with  tracheostomy.  These attempts  have  involved  the  development  of  ever  new  kinds  of surgical  and  percutaneous  puncture  techniques  and  materials, as well as through the performance of percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy  (PDT)  under  bronchoscopic  control  (Oberwalder 2004). Accordingly, the use of fibreoptic bronchoscopy to facilitate PDT has become the standard of care in most institutions (Barba 1995;  Kornblith  2011).  Recently,  some  authors  suggested  using ultrasonography  of  the  neck  to  identify  the  underlying  anatomy with more precision than palpation (Alansari 2015). Durbin stated that \"Tracheal rings are usually easily appreciated and an overlying large  vessel  or  thyroid  gland  can  be  seen  and  avoided  during the procedure\" (Durbin 2010; Sustic 2007). Rudus concluded that because  of  the  paucity  of  randomized  controlled  trials  (RCTs) addressing  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  preprocedural  or  realtime  intraprocedural  ultrasound  guidance  or  both,  during  PDT compared with the current standard of care, no recommendation for  its  use  can  be  made  (Rudas  2012)  However,  Alsansari  stated, that  \"the  best  available  evidence  highly  recommends  the  use  of ultrasound scanning prior to, during, and after PDT to improve the safety of the procedure\" (Alansari 2015)",

      "title": "Description of the intervention",
      "content": "In 1955, Sheldon et al first attempted percutaneous tracheostomy (PT)  (Sheldon  1955).  Since  that  time,  many  different  techniques of  PT  have  been  reported  (Cools-Lartigue  2013):  Pertrach®  (Toy\n1969); PDT (Ciaglia 1985); Rapitrach® (Schachner 1989); the guide wire dilating forceps (GWDF) method (Griggs 1990); translaryngeal tracheostomy (Fantoni 1997); and PercuTwist® (rotational dilation technique) (Frova 2002).\nThe PDT method proposed in Ciaglia 1985 has gained widespread acceptance as an alternative method to conventional surgical tracheostomy (ST) for airway access in patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation (Silvester 2006). Ciaglia originally introduced hydrophilic-coated plastic dilators of increasing sizes over a guide wire (multiple dilator technique) inset in the trachea until the chosen tracheostomy tube could be placed. In  the  year 2000, changes in this technique consisted of creating a  single  dilator  of  appropriate  size  with  a  long  taper  to  create the stoma with a single pass (single dilator technique, frequently cited  by  its  brand  names,  Ciaglia  Blue  Rhino®  or  Ultraperc®). Another modification of the PDT method was the use of a highpressure angiographic balloon to create the stoma (balloon dilation technique, Ciaglia Blue Dolphin®) (Byhahn 2000; Gromann 2009a; Gromann 2009b; Zgoda 2005).\nThe  various  other  percutaneous  methods  have  not  gained  in popularity.  This  is  mainly  because  of  their  difficulty  of  use,  the lack of investigations documenting their safety and efficacy, and their  relatively  high  perioperative  complication  rates  (Brambrink 2004;  Cabrini  2014;  Cools-Lartigue  2013;  Powell  1998).  On  the other  hand,  several  clinical  trials  have  compared  the  various methods  of  performing  PTs  without  any  method  being  shown to  be  conclusively  superior  (Ambesh  2002;  Byhahn  2001;  CoolsLartigue 2013; Kaiser 2006; Nates 2000; Westphal 1999). Cabrini et al performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of 13 randomized studies  comparing  at  least  two  PT  techniques  in  critically  ill adult  patients,  to  investigate  if  one  of  the  six  techniques  found is  superior  to  the  others  with  regard  to  major  intraprocedural complications,  the  early  need  to  convert  to  other  PT  or  surgical techniques, and mild complications. The main result was that the GWDF  technique,  the  multiple  dilator  technique  and  the  single dilator  technique  are  largely  equivalent  for  safety  and  rate  of success, with the multiple dilator technique and the single dilator technique  superior  to  the  GWDF  for  mild  complications.  The other  three  methods  (balloon  dilation  technique,  translaryngeal tracheostomy,  rotational  dilation  technique)  appeared  less  safe and effective (Cabrini 2012). Cools-Lartigue performed a review of 15 randomized trials and found that the single dilator technique is still the benchmark, with the best safety, success, and complication profile (Cools-Lartigue 2013).\nThe  proportion  of  patients  receiving  either  PT  or  ST  and  the predominant tracheostomy technique varies greatly from country to country, hospital to hospital, and in different practice settings (Añón 2004; Blot 2005; Cooper 1998; Fikkers 2003; Fischler 2000; Kluge  2008;  Krishnan  2005),  however,  PDT  is  increasingly  the technique  of  choice  for  critically  ill  patients  in  ICUs  throughout the world (Blondonnet 2014; Cabrini 2014; Delaney 2006; Dennis 2013;  Groves  2007;  Putensen  2014).  PT  was  initially  believed to  be  contraindicated  in  children,  emergency  situations,  when patients  were  markedly  obese  or  had  anatomic  abnormalities such as thyromegaly or neck cancer, or had uncorrectable coagulopathy.  With  growing  experience,  the  indications  for  PT have been expanded and the patient exceptions which mandate a  surgical  tracheostomy  have  decreased.  PT  has  been  applied in  various subgroups (Deppe 2013; Guzman 1995; Heffner 1986a;\nMcCague  2012;  Pandian  2010;  Rosseland  2011;  Takahashi  2014; Toursarkissian 1994a; Toursarkissian1994b). Toursarkissian 1994a stated that PT is the preferred method of tracheostomy placement in patients who have difficult anatomy, although large goitre is still a contraindication. For all of these reasons many authors believe that  PT  is  the  procedure  of  choice  for  most  patients  in  the  ICU who need a tracheostomy (Dennis 2013; Friedman 1996a; Griggs 1991; Groves 2007; Lebiedz 2010; Putensen 2014). However, Cabrini 2012 stated, that no recommendation for specific subgroups (obese patients,  trauma  patients,  cardiac  surgical  patients,etc.)  can  be made, because of the paucity of RCTs addressing these high risk subgroups.",

      "content": "Compared  to  STs,  PTs  seem  to  have  a  number  of  potential advantages.  For  example,  it  is  relatively  simple  to  learn  and perform  (Barba  1995;  Lukas  2007),  thus  even  individuals  who lack extensive surgical training may quickly become adept at this procedure  (Petros  1997;  Pothman  1997).  PTs  may  be  associated with  fewer  peri-  and  postoperative  complications  (5.5%  to  40%) (Cheng  2000;  Gysin  1999;  Hill  1996),  including  bleeding  (Guyatt 2008),  and  infection  rates  (  5%  versus  30%)  (Delaney  2006; Freeman 2000; Friedman 1996a; Higgins 2007; Stauffer 1981). As a  reason  for  the  reduced  incidence  of  wound  infection  Delaney 2006  suggested  minimization  of  local  tissue  damage  with  the dilatational technique, and was in agreement with Iwanaka 1997, who wrote '...the relative preservation of immune functions when minimally invasive techniques are used when compared to an open technique'. The reasons for less perioperative bleeding is the use of  smaller  incisions  and  blunt  dissection  instead  of  cutting  and transecting vessels, and that the tracheostomy tube fits exactly in the stoma, allowing compression of the surrounding tissues. PTs may be performed at the patient's bedside with a limited number of  personnel.  This  eliminates  the  potential  risks  associated  with transporting a critically ill patient (such as accidental disconnection of the breathing circuit or extubation, reduced monitoring during transfer)  (Delaney  2006;  Dulgerov  1999;  Silvester  2006)  as  well as  the  inconvenience  and  expense  of  scheduling  and  utilizing operating room (OR) facilities (Barba 1995; Bowen 2001; Dulgerov 1999,  Melker  1992).  It  is  also  a  more  rapid  procedure,  which is  beneficial  to  unstable,  critically  ill  patients.  The  time  taken from  the  decision  to  perform  a  tracheostomy  to  the  procedure being  performed  is  significantly  shorter  when  tracheostomies are  performed  using  the  PT  method.  `This  may  have  additional implications for critically ill patients including decreased duration of  sedation,  earlier  weaning  from  mechanical  ventilation,  and shorter  overall  length  of  stay  in  the  ICU`  (Arabi  2004;  Griffiths 2005; Rumbak 2004; Shirawi 2005). ICU utilization can be improved as the earlier tracheostomy insertion may allow more aggressive and potentially more rapid weaning, or may allow earlier transfer of  a  patient  with  a  more  secure  airway  (Friedman  1996b;  Wu 2003).  Because  of  these  and  other  advantages,  the  popularity of  this  technique  has  grown  dramatically.  On  the  other  hand, complications that are unusual with conventional surgical methods (ST),  including  paratracheal  insertion  (Bodenham  1992;  Hazard 1988; Leinhardt 1992; Marelli  1990),  pneumothorax,  tracheal laceration,  tracheoesophageal  fistula,  haemorrhage,  and  loss  of the airway, have been reported in association with PT (Alexander 1997; Douglas 1999; Kaloud 1997; Leinhardt 1992; Malthaner 1998; Pothman 1997). Further, it is unknown if the frequency of major late complications of tracheostomy, such as tracheoinnominate artery\nfistula  and  symptomatic  subglottic  stenosis,  differ  substantially when these two techniques are compared.",

      "content": "Avoiding complications which are associated with elective tracheostomies  may  have  beneficial  effects  in  terms  of  reduced morbidity  and  mortality  in  critically  ill  patients.  A  variety  of publications and six previous meta-analyses have compared the effectiveness  and  safety  of  percutaneous  techniques  to  surgical techniques for tracheostomy, in order to evaluate the superiority of one technique over the other (Cheng 2000; Delaney 2006; Dulgerov 1999; Freeman 2000; Higgins 2007; Putensen 2014). However, these reviews do not include some recent studies. In the meta-analysis from Higgins, Ahn 1998, Lukas 2007 and Silvester 2006 are missing. In the review from Delaney, Lukas 2007 is missing. In addition, all of these meta-analyses included only multiple dilator tracheostomy, GWDF and translaryngeal tracheostomy (TLT) in the PT group. Since newer PT techniques, such as single-step dilation tracheostomy, rotational dilation tracheostomy, or balloon dilation tracheostomy are  used  for  PT,  previous  meta-analyses  may  not  reflect  current clinical practice; this was the reason for the Putensen 2014 metaanalysis. But even Putensen 2014, did not consider Ahn 1998, Lukas 2007, Massick 2001, Raine 1999, Xu 2007, or Youssef 2011. Despite the multitude of work published on this topic, the debate about the possible advantages from PT techniques over conventional ST techniques, and whether one PT technique is superior to another PT  technique,  continues.  Therefore,  we  systematically  reviewed the  literature  to  assess  both  efficacy  and  safety  outcomes  of the  use  of  percutaneous  techniques  and  surgical  techniques  for tracheostomy to see if either of the two makes the procedure safer, faster, freer of complications and more often successful.",

Because  detecting  publication bias is difficult, we  tried to  minimize  it  by  comprehensive literature searching, the use of study registries and contacting the manufacturer of tracheostomy devices (Glasziou 2001).\nWe  assessed  reporting  bias  also  by  trying  to  identify  whether the  study  was  included  in  a  trial  registry,  whether  a  protocol  is available,  and  whether  the  methods  section  provided  a  list  of outcomes. We compared the list of outcomes from those sources to the outcomes reported in the published paper.\nWe  used  a  graphical  display  (funnel  plot)  of  the  size  of  the treatment effect against the precision of the trial (1/standard error) to investigate publication bias by examining for signs of asymmetry. Publication bias is associated with asymmetry (Light 1984). In the absence of publication bias, a plot of study sample size (or study weight)  versus  outcome  (that  is,  log  relative  risk)  should  have  a bell  or  inverted  funnel  shape  with  the  apex  near  the  summary effect  estimate  (a  funnel  plot).  If  there  is  asymmetry,  reasons other  than  publication  bias  will  also  be  sought,  for  example, poor methodological quality of smaller studies, true heterogeneity, artefact or chance (Egger 1997).\nAs suggested by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions we did not use funnel plots to assess publication bias when we found less than 10 trials for an endpoint, since asymmetry is difficult to detect with a small number of studies. We used the tests for funnel plot asymmetry only when there were at least 10 studies included in the meta-analysis, and results were interpreted cautiously, with visual inspection of the funnel plots (Higgins 2011).",

We  used models with random-effects, i.e. the Mantel-Haenszel method for dichotomous data (using risk ratio (Relative risk (RR)) as the effect measure) and the  inverse  variance  method  for  continuous  data  (using  SMD  as the effect measure), due to apparent between-study heterogeneity as assessed by Q and I 2  statistics. We calculated 95% confidence intervals and considered corresponding P values equal or less than 5% (two-sided alpha) as statistically significant.\nFor  rare  events,  i.e.  death  directly  related  to  the  procedure, we  used  Peto's  method  (assuming  a  fixed-effect)  to  pool  odds ratios.  Multiple  complications  may  occur  in  a  single  participant. However, manuscripts are often unspecific regarding the number of  participants  with  at  least  one  complication.  Thus,  in  order to include as many studies as possible for meta-analysis, we summarized  data on frequent complications using rate ratios (assuming multiple 'independent' complications and equal observation  time  per  participant)  and  summarized  data  on  rare complications using risk ratios (assuming a single complication per participant).  We  combined  rate  ratios  using  the  inverse  variance method.\nWe assessed the overall quality of evidence for each outcome that included pooled data from RCTs using the GRADE approach (Atkins 2004). We downgraded the evidence from high quality by one level for  serious  (or  by  two  for  very  serious)  study  limitations  (risk  of bias), indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of  effect  estimates  or  potential  publication  bias.  GRADEproGDT 2015 allowed us to import data from Review Manager 5 to create 'Summary  of  findings'  tables  (RevMan  5).  These  tables  provide outcome-specific  information  concerning  the  overall  quality  of evidence from studies included in the comparison, the magnitude of effect of the interventions examined, and the sum of available data on the outcomes we considered.",

However, this conclusion rests on the similarity of the studies included, especially regarding the performance of STs.\nNote that no study reported on PDTs performed in the operating theatre by trainees.",

      "title": "Summary of main results",
      "content": "The evidence comparing open/surgical tracheostomy (ST) versus percutaneous  tracheostomy  (PT)  in  adults  with  experienced  or inexperienced  operators  is  derived  from  the  20  included  studies (16  randomised  controlled  trials  (RCTs)  and  four  quasi-RCTs) from  1990  to  2011,  enrolling  1652  participants.  These  studies have a variety of hospital settings, participants, interventions and outcome measures.\nMost of the trials had low risk or unclear risk of bias across  the  six  domains.  We  could  not  classify  any  trials  at overall low risk of bias. None of the outcomes were of high  quality  evidence.  We  gave  a  GRADE  rating  of  moderate quality  for  one  outcome  (wound  infection/stomatitis),  of  low quality for  five  outcomes  (mortality,  postoperative  mortality, intraoperative  and  direct  postoperative  serious  life-threatening adverse  events,  unfavourable  scarring,  and  tracheostomy  tube occlusion/obstruction,  accidental  decannulation,  difficult  tube change) and of very low for two of the outcomes (intraoperative mortality,  major  bleeding).  There  was  significant  heterogeneity among the studies.\nNone of the studies addressed the impact of PTs on patient-relevant outcomes  (pain,  discomfort,  discomfort  during  the  procedure, caregiver satisfaction). Only one study assessed patient satisfaction after  a  few  months  (Antonelli  2005).  Only  four  of  the  studies addressed the impact of PTs on mortality (Freeman 2001; Friedman 1996; Massick 2001; Porter 1999), and none on the length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) or in hospital.\nOur analyses of the available data suggested that the percutaneous technique improves some, but not all aspects concerned with the effectiveness and safety of tracheostomy.\nBased on the available evidence, using the percutaneous technique, compared to usual practice (open/surgical technique) for  elective  tracheostomy,  significantly  reduces  the  rate  of  late non-life  threatening  events  (tracheal  stenosis,  tracheal  malacia, delayed  wound  healing,  cosmetic  deformity,  tracheocutaneous or  oesophageal  fistula)  by  53%  (rate  ratio  0.47,  95%  confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 0.89, I$^{2} = 65%, P = 0.02, 10 studies, 643  participants),  the  total  number  of  peri-  and  postoperative complications/adverse events by 29% (rate ratio 0.71, 95% CI 0.53 to  0.94,  I$^{2}  =  69%,  P  =  0.02,  20  studies,  1652  participants,  low quality evidence), the rate of wound infection/stomatitis by 76% (risk ratio (Relative risk (RR)) 0.24, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.37, I$^{2} = 0%, P < 0.00001, 12 studies, 936 participants, moderate quality evidence), and the rate of unfavourable scarring by 75% (Relative risk (RR) 0.25, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.91, I$^{2} = 86%, P = 0.04, 6 studies, 789 participants, low quality evidence) in a variety of adult patients in different settings, performed by a wide range  of  variously  experienced  operators  in  different  situations. This  may  be  due  to  minimization  of  local  tissue  damage  with  a dilatational technique, the ease of performance, and of performing the procedure at the bedside in the ICU.\nNon-significant positive effects were seen with respect to postoperative mortality (-70%, P = 0.18) and total mortality (-48%) (Peto  odds  ratio  (POR)  0.52,  95%  CI  0.10  to  2.60,  I$^{2}  =  44%,  P  = 0.42,  4  studies,  257  participants,  low  quality  evidence),  the  rate of  serious  life-threatening  adverse  events  -  intraoperative  (-7%) (Relative risk (RR)  0.93,  95%  CI  0.57  to  1.53,  I$^{2}  =  27%,  P  =  0.78,  12  studies, 1211 participants, low quality evidence), postoperative (-28%) (Relative risk (RR) 0.72,  95%  CI  0.41  to  1.25,  I$^{2}  =  24%,  P  =  0.24,  10  studies,  984 participants, low quality evidence), and the rate of major bleeding (-30%)  (Relative risk (RR)  0.70,  95%  CI  0.45  to  1.09,  I$^{2}  =  47%,  P  =  0.12,  10 studies, 984 participants, very low quality evidence). In addition, the  review  shows  a  trend  towards  an  (not  significantly)  increase of the rate of intraoperative mortality (+639%, P = 0.32), the rate of  intraoperative  (+2%,  P  =  0.86)  and  direct  postoperative  (+2%, P  =  0.94)  non-life  threatening  events  (intraoperatively:  rate  ratio 1.02,  95%  CI  0.79  to  1.32,  I$^{2}  =  0%,  P  =  0.86,  19  studies,  1600 participants;  direct  postoperatively:  rate  ratio  1.02,  95%  CI  0.62\nto  1.67,  I$^{2}  =  10%,  P  =  0.94,  13  studies,  1133  participants),  and the  rate  of  tracheostomy  tube  occlusion/obstruction,  accidental decannulation, difficult tube change (+36%) (Relative risk (RR) 1.36, 95% CI 0.65 to 2.82, I$^{2} = 22%, P = 0.42, 6 studies, 538 participants, low quality evidence).\nOur subgroup analysis shows that the Ciaglia technique (-38%, P = 0.02) is superior to the Griggs technique (-3%, P = 0.92) with respect to the total number of peri- and postoperative complications, that PDTs  are  more  beneficial  for  trainees  (-54%,  P  =  0.009)  in  terms of the total number of peri- and postoperative complications than for  staff  (-28%,  P  =  0.38),  and  that  the  greatest  reduction  of  the total  number  of  peri-  and  postoperative  complications  is  shown when the PDTs performed by staff were carried out in the operating theatre (-53%, P = 0.0010) versus (-28%, P = 0.38).\nAlso,  data  on  patient-relevant  outcomes  such  as  mortality  or patient  discomfort  are  either  sparse  (patient  satisfaction)  or  not available  for  any  study  (caregiver  satisfaction)  to  adequately evaluate the efficacy of using PT techniques.\nHowever,  because  several  groups  of  participants  were  excluded from  the  included  studies  (unfavourable  anatomy,  participants requiring  emergency  tracheostomy,  evidence  or  suspicion  of difficult  anatomy,  prior  airway  problems,  coagulopathies  and previous tracheostomy) or because outcomes were not evaluated (long-term outcomes), the generalizability of the few results of this meta-analysis to all critically ill adult populations is limited.",

      "title": "Quality of the evidence",
      "content": "We  gave  a  GRADE  rating  of  moderate  quality  for  one  outcome (wound  infection/stomatitis), a rating of low quality for six outcomes (mortality, postoperative mortality, intraoperative and direct postoperative serious life-threatening adverse events, unfavourable scarring, and tracheostomy tube occlusion/ obstruction, accidental decannulation, difficult tube change) and very low for two of the outcomes (intraoperative mortality, major bleeding). Most of the trials had a low or unclear risk of bias across the  six  domains,  and  there  was  significant  heterogeneity  among the  studies.  The  main  limiting  factor  (which  was  the  reason  for downgrading the quality of evidence in eleven outcomes), was the serious imprecision of the results. Other reasons for downgrading the quality  of  evidence  in  the  outcomes  were  the  strongly suspected  publication  bias  in  three  outcomes  and  unexplained heterogeneity in three outcomes.\nWe  originally  planned  to  undertake  an  exploratory  subgroup analysis to find out if contextual factors (type of operators, settings) or intervention factors (type of percutaneous tracheostomy (PT) or\nST method) were the cause of the heterogeneity. However, due to the wide variety of procedures, operators and circumstances under which the procedure took place, we could not justify performing all of the planned analyses.\nIt  is  not  easy  to  isolate  the  reasons  for  heterogeneity  because a  tracheostomy  is  a  complex  process.  It  is  plausible  that  the discordance  in  results  among  studies  may  be  due  to  contextual factors (differences in patient populations and practice) or intervention  factors.  In  relation  to  intervention  factors,  there were  many  methodological  differences  among  studies  that  may have  contributed  to  heterogeneity.  In  relation  to  risk  of  bias within  studies,  methodological  quality  ranged  from  high  to  low. The  intervention  could  not  be  blinded  to  personnel,  which  is understandable. It is plausible therefore, that the unblinded nature of the intervention may have prompted a change in behaviour and this may have affected results.\nIn 12 trials, the allocation sequence generation and the allocation concealment were at  low  risk  of  bias  (Ahn  1998;  Antonelli  2005; Freeman 2001; Gysin 1990; Holdgaard 1998; Lukas 2007; Massick 2001; Porter 1999; Raine 1999; Silvester 2006; Wu 2003; Xu 2007), high risk of bias in four studies (random number tables (Friedman 1996),  lots  (Heikkinen  2000),  odd/even  number  (Tabaee  2005), randomization per weeks (Crofts 1995)), and unclear in four of the studies (Hazard 1991; Melloni 2002; Sustic 2002; Xu 2007). We are aware that these studies are a potential risk of bias and have taken this into account when assessing their results.\nThere  were  further  potential  sources  of  bias.  In  only  one  of  the studies  was  the  outcome  assessor  for  the  direct  postoperative outcome blinded (Gysin 1990); in two of the studies the follow-up examiners were blinded (Antonelli 2005; Raine 1999), and in all the remaining studies it remains unclear. There was also considerable clinical  heterogeneity  in  terms  of  the  surgical  approaches  used (different  techniques,  Jackson, Björk, Grillo),  and  the  PT  devices (Ciaglia/Cook,  Griggs/Portex,  Ciaglia/Portex)  used.  Furthermore, different  studies  used  different  methods  (bedside,  operating theatre;  with  or  without  bronchoscopic  guidance),  experienced and  inexperienced  (not  blinded)  operators  who  carried  out  the procedure, and time periods for the procedure. In none of the trials was it stated whether an attempt was made (apart from the general anaesthesia used during the intervention) to blind the patients to the  technique  being  used  for  tracheostomy.  Because  subjective endpoints  (for  example,  patient  satisfaction)  were  examined  in none of the studies, no source of detection bias exists in all.\nThe  performance  of  tracheostomy  is  clearly  dependent  on  the expertise  of  the  operator  for  the  surgical  and  the  percutaneous technique  used.  Crucially,  advances  in  medicine  do  not  come simply from the availability of new technology, but depend on how the technology is actually applied (Guimares 2009). The experience of  practitioners,  and  their  faculties,  in  both  groups,  as  well  as the number of practitioners involved, varied across the included trials.  In  ten  of  the  20  studies,  details  of  the  number  (Ahn  1998; Freeman 2001;  Gysin  1990;  Hazard  1991;  Holdgaard  1998;  Lukas 2007;  Porter  1999;  Raine  1999;  Silvester  2006;  Sustic  2002),  and/ or the experience of the operators who carried out the procedure (Freeman  2001),  were  either  not  provided  or  were  incompletely provided.\nFurthermore, whatever the experience of the operator, there are certain  'tacit'  factors  to  do  with  performing  practical  procedures\nwhich  are  not  (and  indeed  cannot  be)  recorded  in  the  report  of a  clinical  trial,  but  nevertheless  influence  the  effectiveness  and safety  of  the  procedure  (Pope  2003;  Smith  2006).  Some  of  these will  be  non-technical  skills  and,  although  less  obvious,  they  are an essential part of expert performance (Smith 2009; Smith 2010; Smith 2011).\nWe  performed  a  subgroup  analysis  to  determine  whether  the results  for  the  overall  number  of  complications  differed  by  the experience of the practitioner (experienced versus inexperienced). We therefore compared PDTs performed with the Ciaglia technique with multiple dilatator in the ICU by trainees (Ahn 1998; Crofts 1995; Friedman 1996; Hazard 1991; Massick 2001; Porter 1999; Silvester 2006;  Xu  2007)  with  those  performed  by  staff  (Melloni  2002;  Wu 2003). The result for the overall number of complications in this first subgroup (Analysis 2.2), demonstrated that PDTs performed with the Ciaglia technique with multiple dilatator by trainees in the ICU significantly reduced the total number of peri- and postoperative complications  by  54%  (rate  ratio  0.46,  95%  CI  0.26  to  0.83,  I$^{2}  = 74%, P = 0.009) (Analysis 2.2). The result for the overall number of complications in this second subgroup, demonstrated that there was no evidence of a difference in this outcome (rate ratio 0.72, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.51, I$^{2} = 0%, P = 0.38) (Analysis 2.2). Our comparison shows that PDTs are more beneficial for trainees in terms of the total number of peri- and postoperative complications than for staff.\nThe most recent study included by us in this review is from 2011 (Youssef 2011). The 20 included studies cover a period of 21 years, during which time frame there has been a considerable change in the surgical procedures, the devices used for PT, and the routine use of PT in clinical practice.",

      "content": "Five  meta  analyses  compared  the  effectiveness  of  percutaneous tracheostomy  (PT)  with  open/surgical  tracheostomy  (ST)  (Cheng 2000; Delaney 2006; Freeman 2000; Higgins 2007; Putensen 2014).\nIn  the  meta-analysis  of  prospective  trials  comparing  PT  and  ST in  critically  ill  participants,  Freeman  2000,  pooled  data  from  five\nstudies with 236 participants (Crofts 1995; Friedman 1996; Hazard 1991;  Holdgaard  1998;  Porter  1999).  They  concluded  that  only  a limited  number  of  small  studies  prospectively  evaluated  PT  and ST.  Their  meta-analysis  suggests  the  potential  advantages  of  PT relative  to  ST,  including  ease  of  performance,  lower  incidence of  peristomal  bleeding  and  postoperative  infection,  as  well  as postoperative  complications  in  general.  They  speculate  that  the differences  in  rates  of  bleeding  and  infection  can  be  explained by  differences  in  the  tracheostomy  stoma  following  these  two techniques.  Specifically,  following  percutaneous  placement,  the stoma fits snugly around the tracheostomy tube. This lack of dead space conceivably serves to both tamponade bleeding vessels and to impede infection. In contrast, following ST, the stoma fits loosely around  the  tracheostomy  tube.  Thus,  no  tamponading  effect  or barrier to infection occurs. This tamponading effect may similarly explain  why  PT  was  associated  with  less  operative  bleeding. Because  PT  is  a  bedside  procedure  it  avoids  both  the  delays inherent in procedures performed in the operating room (PT can be carried out 10 minutes more quickly) and the potential risks and inconvenience  associated  with  patient  transport.  Freeman  2000, also saw the need for more adequately powered prospective trials to support these findings.\nIn  their  meta-analysis,  Cheng  2000,  included  four  RCTs  that compared the complications of ST and PT (Crofts 1995; Friedman 1996; Hazard 1991; Holdgaard 1998). Although their meta-analysis was  published  in  September  2000,  the  Porter  1999  study  from February  1999,  is  not  included.  Cheng  2000,  found  that  ST  had a  five-fold  higher  complication  rate  than  PT,  and  that  these complications were often more severe. They conclude that PT is a safer procedure for elective tracheostomy in patients with a normal sized neck.\nThe systematic review with meta-analysis on percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) versus ST in critically ill participants  by  Delaney  2006  has  17  included  studies,  and  until now, was the most extensive work on this topic. The Ahn 1998 trial was included in Delaney et al following translation by Jong Joon. The Lukas 2007 study was not included in Delaney 2006; neither was the meta-analysis from Higgins 2007.\nA comparison between the data used by Delaney 2006 and those we used, show the following differences.\n1. In the table \"Characteristic of randomized trials ...\", Delaney et al stated that in the Gysin 1999 study, STs and PTs were performed by  staff.  In  the  original  publication,  however,  it  was  recorded that, \"All tracheostomies were performed or supervised by one of the first two authors (CG, PD), both of whom have extensive experience with this procedure.\"\n2. Further, they stated that in the Heikkinen 2000 study, ST and PT were performed by staff. In the original publication, however, it was recorded that \"All tracheostomies were performed by one of four surgeons.\"\n3. In  the  \"Summary  of  long-term  complications\",  Delaney  2006 reported that 11 from 56 patients were available for long-term follow-up in each group, but altogether 11 from 57 patients were available.\n4. Delaney 2006 wrote that in the Holdgaard 1998 study, ST was performed by trainees and PT was performed by staff. However, in the original publication it was stated \"the (ST) procedure was carried out by an experienced specialist in surgery or by senior\nTrusted evidence. Informed decisions.\nBetter health.\nregistrars in their final training.\" And, in the original publication, it was stated that \"The PT procedures were performed by one of the authors.\"\n5. In the original publication from Holdgaard 1998, eight authors are named. Table 3 in this publication, however, indicated the number  of  operators  for  PDT  to  be  four.  Whether  the  eight authors are experienced in terms of PDT remains open.\n6. Delaney 2006,  stated  that  in  the  Silvester  2006  study,  ST  and PDT  were  performed  by  trainees.  In  the  original  publication, however, it is stated that \"Only intensivists or supervised senior trainees  who  had  completed  at  least  ten  PTs  performed  the PTs, ... . The STs were carried out in the ICU by one of two thoracic surgeons (SK, SS) or their supervised senior trainees who had completed at least ten STs.\"\n7. Furthermore, Delaney 2006 stated that the incidence of significant  bleeding  in  the  Silvester  2006  study  was10/100  in the  PDT  group  and  6/100  in  the  ST  group.  In  the  original publication (see table 4 from Silvester 2006), the authors stated that there was moderate and severe operative bleeding in four (PDT) patients and one (ST) patient, and moderate and severe postoperative bleeding in seven (PDT) and five (ST) patients.\nUnlike  the  details  in  the  Delaney  2006  meta-analysis,  we  found sufficient randomization in the Gysin 1999 and Wu 2003 studies.\nDelaney 2006, concluded that their systematic review and metaanalysis  demonstrated  that  the  technique  of  PT  has  a  number of  important  advantages  over  ST  in  critically  ill  patients  who require  an  elective  tracheostomy.  Theyconcluded  that  PT  was associated with a reduction in the incidence of clinically important wound infections compared with traditional ST;this is consistent with  the  results  of  our  investigation.  Secondly,  Delaney  2006 found that  there  was  no  evidence  overall  that  PT  resulted  in  an increased  incidence  of  clinically  significant  bleeding  (consistent with  our  results),  major  periprocedural  complications  (overall complications  decreased  by  15%  (Relative risk (RR)  0.85,  95%  CI  0.65  to  1.12, P  =  0.25),  intraoperative  serious,  life-threatening  adverse  events increased by 31% (Relative risk (RR) 1.31, 95% CI 0.62 to 2.79, P = 0.48), direct postoperative  serious,  life-threatening  adverse  events  decreased by  13%  (Relative risk (RR)  0.87,  95%  CI  0.49  to  1.54,  P  =  0.63))  Odds ratio (or)  long-term complications (consistent with our results (Relative risk (RR) 0.73, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.97, P = 0.03)).\nAs a  reason  for  the  reduced  incidence  of  wound  infection, Delaney  2006  suggested  minimization  of  local  tissue  damage with  a  dilatational  technique,  or  in  agreement  with  Iwanaka 1997, who wrote \"...the relative preservation of immune functions when  minimally  invasive  techniques  are  used  when  compared to  an  open  technique.  Delaney  2006  stated  further,  that  one considerable advantage of PT is the relative safety and convenience of  performing  the  procedure  at  the  bedside  in  the  ICU,  which obviates  the  need  to  transport  a  critically  ill  patient,  and  a shorter waiting period prior to performing the tracheotomy (these assumptions correspond to our estimates, but cannot be confirmed with the study results). The transport of critically ill patients is often logistically difficult and exposes the patient to increased likelihood for  adverse  events  and  risk  to  safety  (Beckmann  2004;  Lovell 2001;  Warren  2004;  Waydhas  1999).  The  results  of  the  Delaney 2006  analysis  supports  the  assertion  that  the  elective  transport of critically ill patients to the operating theatre for STs may pose undue and increased risk of complications and death.\nIn  their  meta-analysis,  Higgins  2007  include  15  RCTs,  in  the English language. This meta-analysis included nearly 1000 patients comparing the complication rates, the cost-effectiveness, and the procedure length of STs and PTs. Although the meta-analysis was published  in  March  2007,  it  did  not  include  the  following  three studies (Ahn 1998; Lukas 2007; Silvester 2006).\nIn  reviewing  the  numbers  underlying  the  calculations  of  the authors, we found discrepancies with the numbers mentioned in the original publications.\n· Figure 1: Comparison for decannulation/obstruction: in Higgins 2007: PDT 10/35, ST 2/35; the original Gysin 1990 study had no data for decannulation; obstruction in Gysin 1999:PDT 1/35, ST 0/35; in Higgins 2007: PDT 1/40, ST 0/40; the original publication (Freeman 2001) had no data; in Higgins 2007: PDT 2/41, ST 0/42; in the original publication (Wu 2003), premature extubation of translaryngeal tube: PDT 2, ST 0. So this evaluation was based on three incorrect data records.\n· Figure 2: Comparison for wound infection/stomatitis: in Higgins 2007:  PT  0/30,  ST  0/26;  in  the  original  publication,  Heikkinen 2000: PT 0/31, ST 0/26; in Higgins 2007: PDT 1/26, ST 4/27; in the original publication, Friedman 1996: PDT 0/26, ST 4/27; in Higgins  2007:  PDT  3/30,  ST  8/30;  in  the  original  publication, Holdgaard 1998, minor infection: PDT 3, ST 11; major infection: PDT 0, ST 8. So this evaluation was also based on three incorrect data records.\n· Figure 3. Comparison for unfavourable scarring: in Higgins 2007: PT 1/67, ST 3/72; in the original publication, Antonelli 2005, no data were found; in Higgins 2007: PT 0/30, ST 1/26; in the original publication,  Heikkinen  2000,  eleven  of  57  patients  were  alive 18  months  postoperatively  and  answered  a  questionnaire;  in Higgins  2007:  PT  13/50,  ST  18/50;  in  the  original  publication, Raine 1999: PT 13/50, ST 14/50. So this evaluation was also based on three incorrect data records.\nHiggins 2007 found a decreased incidence of unfavourable scarring,  wound  infection/stomatitis,  and  decreased  case  length favouring  PT.  For  complications  relating  to  decannulation  and airway  obstruction,  ST  was  favoured.  There  was  no  statistical difference  between  groups  for  false  passage  rates,  minor  or major haemorrhage, death, long-term complications and rates of subglottic stenosis.\nHiggins 2007 concluded that their meta-analysis has shown that PTs trend toward fewer overall complications than open techniques (STs) (consistent with the results of our investigation) and appear to  be  more  cost-effective  (not  examined  in  our  investigation)  by releasing operating room resources, including time and personnel, provide  greater  feasibility  in  terms  of  bedside  capability,  and allow non-surgeons to safely perform the procedure. Higgins 2007 concluded  further  that  PT  appears  to  be  a  safe  alternative  to traditional open ST, but that there is no body of literature favouring one over the other in terms of perioperative complication rates.\nThe conclusion that complications of tracheostomy, such as tube occlusion/obstruction, accidental decannulation and difficult tube change, were significantly more likely to occur in PTs and strongly favoured the open surgical technique, failed to confirm with our results.  Higgins  2007  speculated  that  this  may  relate  to  the  fact that the surgical techniques produce a well defined insertion tract that allows the insertion of a tracheotomy tube, with an inner and\nouter cannula, that facilitates nursing and allows an easier cannula changing.  However,  the  percutaneous  method  was  significantly better  for  wound  infection/stomatitis  and  scarring.  Higgins  2007 demanded  that  future  directions  should  include  a  comparison between  open  bedside  and  percutaneous  bedside  tracheotomy, with  detailed  cost-effectiveness  analysis.  Although  Higgins  2007 evaluated 443 patients less, and there are differences between the characteristics and the results used in their meta-analysis and our meta-analysis,  the  conclusions  derived  from  the  results  are  very similar.\nThe  meta-analysis  presented  by  Putensen  2014,  was  performed according  to  Cochrane  guidelines  and  includes  14  RCTs  with 973  patients.  In  our  review,  we  included  20  trials  from  1990  to 2011, enrolling 1646 patients; Putensen 2014 does not include the following studies: Ahn 1998; Lukas 2007; Massick 2001; Raine 1999; Xu  2007;  Youssef  2011.  They  observed  a  reduced  risk  of  major postprocedural bleeding with PT (odds ratio (Odds ratio (OR)) 0.39, 95% CI 0.15 to  0.97,  P  =  0.04,  I 2   =  0%).  Like  other  meta-analyses,  we  did  not distinguish  between  intraoperative  and  postoperative  bleeding, and  also  did  not  observe  a  reduction  in  bleeding  following  PT. They  did  not  include  four  studies  in  their  meta-analysis:  Hazard 1991  (PDT  1/24;  ST  4/24);  Massick  2001  (PDT  2/50;  ST  5/50); Lukas  2007  (PT  10/100;  ST  2/105);  Tabaee  2005  (PDT  1/29;  ST 0/14).  They  looked  for  the  rate  of  stoma  infection  and  stated that  in  the  postprocedural  period,  PT  techniques  reduced  odds for  this  outcome  (Odds ratio (OR)  0.22,  95%  CI  0.11  to  0.41,  P  <  0.00001,  I 2 =  0%). We have additionally taken into account the studies from Massick 2001 and Youssef 2011, but the result is still the same. In addition, Putensen 2014 observed that the pooled summary data indicated a faster procedure with PT than ST, but that this has to be  viewed  with  caution  because  of  the  significant  heterogeneity among the studies (I 2  = 97%). Because of this high heterogeneity, we decided to dispense with a summary of the data. We did not look for the following outcomes: minor bleeding, tracheal stenosis; major  intraprocedural  bleeding,  technical  difficulties.  A  further comparison  of  results  is  therefore  not  possible.  Putensen  2014 came  to  the  conclusion  that  on  the  basis  of  available  evidence from  RCTs  in  critically  ill  adult  patients,  PT  techniques  can  be performed  faster  and  reduce  stoma  inflammation  and  infection, but  are  associated  with  increased  technical  difficulties  when compared with ST. These results correspond (as far as we have been considering this outcome) to our own.",

      "title": "Implications for practice",
      "content": "There are several important implications for practice arising from our systematic review and meta-analysis.\nOur systematic review clearly shows that there are some benefits in  terms  of  effectiveness  and  safety  of  the  use  of  percutaneous techniques  for  tracheostomy.  These  regard  rate  of  late  non-life threatening complications, total number of peri- and postoperative complications/adverse events, rate of wound infection/stomatitis and  rate  of  unfavourable  scarring  in  a  variety  of  different  adult patients  in  different  settings,  performed  by  a  wide  range  of differently experienced operators in different situations.\nNon-significant positive effects based on low quality evidence were seen with respect to postoperative mortality and total mortality, rate of serious postoperative life-threatening adverse events and\nthe rate of major bleeding. In addition, the review shows a trend towards  a  (not  significant)  increase  in  the  rate  of  intraoperative mortality,  rate  of  intraoperative  and  direct  postoperative  nonlife threatening events, and rate of tracheostomy tube occlusion/ obstruction,  accidental  decannulation  or  difficult  tube  change. Our  subgroup  analysis  shows  that  the  Ciaglia  (multiple  dilator) technique is superior to the Griggs technique with respect to  the  total  number  of  peri-  and  postoperative  complications, that  percutaneous  dilatational  tracheostomies  (PDTs)  are  more beneficial  for  trainees  in  terms  of  the  total  number  of  periand  postoperative  complications  than  for  staff,  and  that  the greatest reduction of the total number of peri- and postoperative complications is shown, when the PDTs performed by staff were carried out in the operating theatre. The statements made above apply exclusively to the multiple dilator technique but not to the single dilator technique (frequently cited by its brand names Ciaglia Blue  Rhino ®   or  Ultraperc ® )  nor  the  balloon  dilation  technique (Ciaglia  Blue  Dolphin ® )  because  these  techniques  have  not  been evaluated in any of the studies included in our systematic review and meta-analysis.\nHowever, because several groups of patients were excluded from the  included  studies  (unfavourable  anatomy,  patients  requiring emergency tracheostomy, evidence or suspicion of difficult anatomy,  prior  airway  problems,  coagulopathies  and  previous tracheostomy), or patient-relevant outcomes were not evaluated (long-term  outcomes,  patient  discomfort,  patient  satisfaction, caregiver  satisfaction)  or  not  completely  evaluated  (mortality), the generalizability of the few results of this meta-analysis to all critically ill adults is limited.\nApplying  guidelines  to  real-life  clinical  practice  can  be  difficult because  their  effectiveness  is  dependent  upon  many  factors, including clinician acceptance of the guidelines, workload, availability  of  the  equipment,  frequency  of  assessments,  and continuation  of  assessment  and  feedback  to  ensure  compliance with guidelines. Also, data on patient-relevant outcomes such as mortality or patient discomfort are either sparse (low number of studies (N = 4) and events for mortality (N = 6); one study assessed patient  satisfaction  after  a  few  months)  or  not  available  for  any study  (discomfort  during  the  procedure,  caregiver  satisfaction) to adequately evaluate the efficacy of using percutaneous tracheostomy (PT) techniques.\nWe  had  planned  to  perform  subgroup  analyses  to  determine whether the results differed by age, urgency, technique, experience of  the  practitioner  or  the  location  where  the  tracheostomy  was performed.  We  only  performed  subgroup  analyses  to  determine whether  the  results  differed  by  experience  of  the  practitioner (experienced  versus  not  experienced)  or  the  location  where  the tracheostomy was performed because the included studies were very heterogeneous (Characteristics of included studies).\nNo difference in the overall number of complications was seen if the PTs were performed in the intensive care unit (ICU) by trainees or staff.\nThere  are  a  number  of  potential  limitations  of  our  review  that warrant discussion.\nFirst, unfavourable anatomy was identified as a restriction to the percutaneous  technique  in  most  studies,  which  reflects  current practice, and the importance of determining anatomic landmarks\nfor  this  procedure.  In  most  of  the  studies,  the  lack  of  palpable midline  structures  (thyroid  cartilage,  cricoid  cartilage,  sternal notch) was a contraindication to perform a PT. So these patients were excluded from the included studies.\nSecond,  several  further  groups  of  patients  (patients  requiring emergency tracheostomy, evidence or suspicion of difficult anatomy,  prior  airway  problems,  coagulopathies  and  previous tracheostomy) or outcomes (long-term outcomes) were excluded from the included studies.\nThird,  several  outcomes  were  not  always  (mortality,  patient satisfaction after a few months) or never (patient discomfort during the procedure, caregiver satisfaction) reported or evaluated.\nFourth,  there  is  a  paucity  of  evidence  demonstrating  that  one technique of PT is clearly superior to any other.\nFifth,  there  was  great  heterogeneity  between  definitions  for outcomes/definitions  of  complications  used  in  the  studies  (e.g. wound infection, major/minor bleeding, duration).\nBecause  of  these  limitations,  generalizability  of  the  few  results of  this  meta-analysis  to  all  critically  ill  adult  patients  requiring tracheostomy, is limited.\nThus, surgical tracheostomy (ST) may still be indicated for selected patients, despite the continuing broader indications for use of PT.",

      "content": "In  many  studies,  many  important  details  were  not  described in  sufficient  detail.  More  well  designed  clinical  trials  with  high methodological  quality  are  needed  to  quantify  differences  of contextual factors (type of operators - experienced, inexperienced; patient populations -children, patients with unfavourable anatomy  or  coagulopathies  and  patients  requiring  emergency tracheostomy;  settings  -  ICU,  operating  room;  and  intervention factors  -  type  of  percutaneous  or  surgical  technique,  ultrasound\nexamination  before  tracheotomy)  on  the  complication  rate,  the overall mortality, the procedure length and costs. Great emphasis must  be  placed  on  attempts  to  reduce  bias  and  increase  power to  show  differences  in  patient-relevant  clinical  outcomes  (i.e. mortality). With such studies it may be possible to developed an algorithm  which  enables  clinicians  to  find  the  best  tracheotomy proceedings for a particular patient in a particular condition.\nFurthermore,  such  trials  must  fully  evaluate  the  components  of this complex intervention by focusing on mixed methods research. Future  studies  of  the  efficacy  of  PT  should  follow  a  framework that  incorporates  process  evaluation  (such  as  that  advocated by  MRC  2008)  to  understand  how  context  influences  outcome, and  to  provide  insights  to  aid  implementation  in  other  settings. In  addition,  an  economic  evaluation  taking  into  consideration the  cost-effectiveness  of  the  method,  not  only  from  the  payer's perspective, but also from that of service users and society as a whole, would be useful for decision-makers.",

      "content": "The differences between the review and the published protocol (Brass 2009), are as follows.\n1. We used Cochrane's new domain-based evaluation to assess the validity and quality of the included studies. This was released after publication of the protocol.\n2. We planned to performed sensitivity analysis regarding 'randomized versus quasi-randomized' and possibly 'good quality studies versus poor quality studies' to test how sensitive the results are to reasonable changes in the assumptions that are made and in the protocol for combining the data. We have not undertaken the sensitivity analysis since almost all the included studies have a high risk of bias.\n3. We planned to examine the outcomes 'patient satisfaction after a few months', 'discomfort during the procedure' or 'patient/caregiver satisfaction.' We have not undertaken these analyses since only one of the studies assessed patient satisfaction after a few months (Antonelli 2005), and none of the studies assessed discomfort during the procedure or patient/caregiver satisfaction.\n4. In the methods, data synthesis section of the published protocol we stated that 'for dichotomous data, we will describe results both as a relative measure (relative risk (Relative risk (RR)) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)) and an absolute measure (number needed to treat and risk difference). Relative measures can be used to combine studies but absolute measures can be more informative than relative measures because they reflect the baseline risk as well as the change in risk with the intervention.' And 'we will analyse results using both fixedeffect and random-effects analysis because for each model there are situations where the result is counterintuitive.' In the review we used random-effects models, i.e. the Mantel-Haenszel method for dichotomous data (using risk ratio (Relative risk (RR)) as effect measure) and the inverse variance method for continuous data (using SMD as effect measure), due to apparent between-study heterogeneity, as assessed by Q and I 2  statistics.\n5. Bettina Kullmer is no longer an author of the review.\n6. A new author (Anna Wrzosek) has joined the review team.\n7. In the abstract and the objective section of the published protocol we wrote that 'we will evaluate the efficacy and safety of percutaneous techniques (PT) for tracheostomy as the primary objective.' In the sections of the review we write \"... for elective tracheostomy in critically ill patients (adults and children).\" And we added the following statement to the outcomes section \"We excluded studies of tracheotomy in emergency situations, in not critically ill or homecare patients.\" In the protocol, we expressed ourselves imprecisely. We never intended to include emergency tracheotomies or tracheotomies in non-critically ill patients.\n8. We added the following statement to the outcomes section, \"We differentiated between intraoperative, postoperative and long-term complications. We included studies irrespective of whether all of this information was available.\"\n9. In the protocol we planned to consider the following outcomes.\n· Primary outcomes : 1. mortality directly related to the procedure (measured as the proportion of patients who died intraoperatively or during the first 24 hours after the intervention) (*absolute numbers (N/N) and expressed as percentage (%) (*)); 2. serious, lifethreatening,  adverse  events e.g.  major  vascular  injury  or  excessive  bleeding  (blood  transfusion  or  need  for  additional  surgical procedure),  tracheal  or  oesophageal  injury  (detected  by  intraoperative  bronchoscopy),  loss  of  airway  (loss  of  the  tube  or  the tracheostoma tube > 20 sec.) or misplaced airway (paratracheal insertion of the tube or the tracheostoma tube), severe hypoxic episode (SaO 2  < 90%) or cardiac arrest) (*).\n· Secondary outcomes : 1. non-life threatening events during the procedure e.g. minimal or moderate bleeding (bleeding could be stopped by conservative measures), subcutaneous emphysema (detected during the first 24 hours by chest x-ray), pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum (both detected by postoperative chest x-ray), or difficult tube placement) (*); 2. postoperative complications e.g. pneumonia, atelectasis (detected by postoperative chest x-ray), stomal infections (local inflammation, cellulitis or pus, necrosis or wound breakdown - with or without antibiotic therapy), difficult tube change and hoarseness) (*); 3. late complications e.g. tracheal stenosis (mild 10% to 30%, moderate 30% to 50%, severe > 50%), tracheal malacia, delayed wound healing (> 3 weeks), cosmetic deformity  (colour  changes  at  the  scar,  level  difference  with  the  surrounding  skin,  surgical  revision  needed),  tracheo-cutaneous,  oesophageal fistula) (*); 4. patient/caregiver satisfaction (*); 5. duration of the procedure (minutes).\nDuring our evaluation, we determined that it is more useful to look at the outcomes differentiated. For this reason, we decided to subdivide the outcomes and distinguish them as follows.\nTrusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health.\n· Primary outcomes : 1. Mortality directly related to the procedure: A. intraoperative mortality (measured as the proportion of patients who died intraoperatively); and B. postoperative mortality (measured as the proportion of patients who died during the first 24 hours after the intervention). 2. Serious, life-threatening adverse events : A. Intraoperative serious, life-threatening adverse events (major vascular injury or excessive bleeding (determined by need for blood transfusion or an additional surgical procedure)), tracheal or oesophageal injury (detected by intraoperative bronchoscopy), loss of the airway (loss of the tube or tracheostoma tube > 20 sec) or a misplaced airway (paratracheal insertion of the tube or the tracheostoma tube), a severe hypoxic episode, or cardiac arrest); and B. Direct postoperative serious, life-threatening adverse events (major vascular injury or excessive bleeding (determined by need for blood transfusion or an additional surgical procedure), a severe hypoxic episode, or saturation < 90 %).\n· Secondary outcomes : 1. Non-life threatening events : A. Intraoperative non-life threatening events (minimal or moderate bleeding (where  bleeding  could  be  stopped  by  conservative  measures)),  subcutaneous  emphysema  (detected  during  the  first  24  hours by  chest  x-ray),  cuff  puncture,  transient  hypotension,  pneumothorax  or  pneumomediastinum  (both  detected  by  postoperative chest x-ray), cannula misplacement or difficult tube placement); B. Direct postoperative non-life  threatening events (pneumonia, atelectasis  (detected  by  postoperative  chest  x-ray),  difficult  tube  change,  tracheostomy  tube  occlusion/obstruction,  accidental decannulation);  and  C. Late  non-life  threatening  events (tracheal  stenosis,  tracheal  malacia,  delayed  wound  healing,  cosmetic deformity, tracheocutaneous or oesophageal fistula). 2. Total number of peri- and postoperative complications/adverse events . 3. Duration of the procedure. 4. Wound infection/stomatitis . 5. Unfavourable scarring . 6. Major bleeding . 7. Tracheostomy tube occlusion/obstruction, accidental decannulation, difficult tube change . 8. patient/caregiver satisfaction .\nWe think that this structure is clearer and easier to understand.",
