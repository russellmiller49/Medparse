Initial efforts at removal of blood clots and airway secretions may involve lavage, suction, baskets, and forceps extraction through a flexible bronchoscope. If unsuccessful, further management options include rigid bronchoscopy, balloon catheter dislodgment, and topical thrombolytic agents. 1-4 Nevertheless, tenacious airway secretions, and in particular blood clots, can be painstakingly difficult and time consuming to remove by any means. Furthermore, many of these patients require mechanical ventilation and monitoring in the intensive care unit, and conversion to a rigid bronchoscope and transfer to the operating room can be problematic. Relief of the obstruction should be accomplished in a safe and efficient manner. Unfortunately, there have been no prospective studies comparing the various methods and no prospective studies comparing rigid to flexible bronchoscopy for these purposes. Therefore, the decision on how to proceed is typically based on individual and institutional experience and practice. Although case series and institutional reviews of these various techniques have been published, the existing data on cryoextraction of blood clots, airway secretions, or foreign bodies are extremely limited.\nThe cryotherapy probe is an effective tool used by both interventional and general pulmonologists.

Direct contact with the cryoprobe tip freezes the liquid component of blood clots, airway secretions, and foreign bodies. Cryoadherence occurs, allowing for extraction times of a few seconds. 5 The catheter can be passed through a flexible bronchoscope, a rigid bronchoscope, or a combination of the 2. It has many potential clinical applications: management of endobronchial obstruction due to benign or malignant tumors, 6 tissue sampling for endobronchial tumor, 7 and tissue sampling in interstitial lung disease 8 or lung transplantation. 9 Case reports of endobronchial blood clot and foreign body extraction using a cryoprobe have been published. 5,10-14 The cryoprobe may have an additional beneficial hemostatic effect through vasoconstriction; however, evidence supporting this effect is limited.\nDespite the limited publications supporting its use, cryoextraction has been proposed as the treatment of choice for removal of blood clots from the tracheobronchial tree. 5 To better define its role, we performed a systematic, retrospective, single-institution review on the clinical utility and safety of bronchoscopic cryoextraction of blood clots, airway secretions, and foreign bodies.",

A total of 38 cryotherapy sessions performed on 30 subjects were included for analysis. Subject characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The mean age was\n52.6 years, 20 (66.7%) were male. The indications were acute airway obstruction from blood clots (26), mucous plugging (6), foreign bodies (4), and plastic bronchitis (2). The locations of the lesions are summarized in Table 2. All sessions were performed at the bedside with flexible bronchoscopy in the inpatient setting. Thirty-three of 38 sessions were performed on patients on mechanical ventilation, one through a tracheostomy tube, the remainder through an oral endotracheal tube.\nClinical and safety outcomes are summarized in Table 3. Reestablishment of airway patency was successful in 32/38 (84.2%) sessions. Blood clot extraction was successful in 24/26 (92%) sessions with the failures occurring in the setting of continued and excessive airway bleeding. In no case did removal of blood clots lead to significant or persistent airway bleeding. Improvement in oxygenation and/or ventilation occurred in 21/31 (68%) sessions. Mucous plugging extraction was successful in 4/6 (66.7%) sessions. Foreign body extraction was successful in 2/4 (50%) of sessions. The patient with plastic bronchitis underwent 2/2 (100%) successful extraction sessions.\nDuring the study period, there was only one complication of transient hypotension related to sedation that resolved with an intravenous fluid bolus.

      "content": "This study demonstrates that cryoprobe extraction of blood clots, airway secretions, and foreign bodies can be safely, reliably, and efficiently accomplished in the inpatient setting and on patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Acute airway obstruction due to endobronchial blood clots, airway secretions, or foreign bodies is not uncommon and is potentially life-threatening. A variety of other bronchoscopic techniques have been used to manage this problem, yet there is no bronchoscopic method that has been established as the gold standard. Important aspects to any procedure are reducing the degree of invasiveness and time to completion, while maintaining or improving efficacy and safety. Cryoextraction with flexible bronchoscopy offers several potential advantages over rigid bronchoscopy, including ready availability, patient comfort, and ease of use in the intensive care unit in patients on mechanical ventilation.\nOur study reported 1 complication of transient hypotension related to sedation that resolved with an intravenous fluid bolus.

Although we did not identify any immediate complications related to the use of the cryoprobe, the relatively small number of subjects and the retrospective nature of the study limit these findings. In a study performed by Mathur et al, 6 a cryoprobe was used to manage endobronchial obstruction due to tumor. Two cases were complicated by bronchospasm and 1 by cardiopulmonary arrest. It was unclear how the complications were related to the procedure. Nevertheless, from the available data and our experience, we believe that cryoprobe extraction is a safe method of airway clearance of blood clots, airway secretions, and liquid-based foreign bodies.\nAirway obstruction from blood clots (Fig. 1) was relieved with cryoextraction in >90% of sessions, with failure seen only in the setting of continued and excessive airway bleeding, supporting the opinion that it should be considered the method of choice for removal of blood clots in the airway. 6 This recommendation has been made on the basis of the adherent properties of cryotherapy and the personal experience of the authors Homasson and Vergnon. 5 It is also supported by several case reports 10-14 but no other case series. The cryoprobe appears to be particularly useful in removing blood clots that are otherwise difficult and time consuming to remove by flexible bronchoscopy. Cold promotes coagulation and the cryoprobe seems to firmly solidify and strengthen blood clots, facilitating extraction of large bronchial casts compared with suction, biopsy forceps, and basket extraction where clots easily fragment. Probe contact time varied by case and by\nbronchoscopist. Although not specifically studied, our subjective impression is that longer contact times of 1 to 2 minutes promote removal of large airway casts while helping to control focal bleeding. Our perception is supported by the large casts we removed and by the fact that we had no incidence of significant bleeding after removal of blood clots. It must be noted, however, that it is our general approach to wait 24 hours after an acute bleed before attempting clot removal, and early removal was attempted only in cases in which it was believed that the potential benefit of clot removal outweighed the risks of inciting new or increased airway bleeding.\nExtraction of mucous secretions was successful in 4 of 6 cases. We must add that the mucous extraction was not nearly as dramatic as the large airway casts that were removed with blood clot extraction. In addition, it was used only for removal of extremely tenacious secretions when conventional bronchoscopy failed.\nOur experience with foreign body cryoextraction is limited but was successful in only 2 of 4 cases. Cryoadherence and extraction relies on the freezing of liquid within or surrounding a foreign body. Therefore, whereas most organic materials are reliably adherent, inorganic materials are not. Nevertheless, there are exceptions, and it has been recommended that, when feasible, identical objects should be tested for cryoadherence before the attempt is made in the patient. 15 In addition, within the airway there may be sufficient moisture on the surface of the foreign body or liquid can be sprayed on the foreign body to facilitate cryoadherence and extraction. 12\nOur single case of plastic bronchitis (Fig. 2), with a successful outcome using cryoextraction combined with inhaled fibrinolytic and rhDNase therapy as previously reported, 16 supports its use for this indication. While a rare occurrence, plastic bronchitis can be life-threatening and extremely difficult to manage by any means. Therefore, although there are no other case reports on the use of cryoextraction for plastic bronchitis and commentary on its utility for this indication is necessarily limited, we found it extremely useful for this indication and recommend it be considered.\nWe would like to summarize some pitfalls of using flexible cryoprobe. First, although the cryoprobe is effective in removing organized blood clots, it may not adequately control\nairway bleeding; the local and systemic causes of bleeding should be explored and addressed. Second, for foreign body cryoextraction in intubated patients, the operator must consider the size of the foreign body and the size of the endotracheal tube, as the foreign body might be difficult to extract through smaller-sized tubes, leading to dislodgement of the foreign body or requiring endotracheal tube removal. Foreign bodies larger than the endotracheal tube orifice can be extracted by withdrawing the foreign body, bronchoscope, and endotracheal in concert. Third, the cryoprobe could potentially damage the endobronchial mucosa and potentially perforate the bronchus, 17 thus the operator must maintain direct visualization of the airway during its use. Fourth, liquid can freeze within the bronchoscopy channel in the small space surrounding the catheter and fracture the inner lining of the channel, resulting in an air leak. To avoid this problem, the tip of the cryoprobe should be at least 4 to 5 mm distal to the tip of the bronchoscope, and complete thawing should occur before withdrawal of the probe through the bronchoscopy channel. Fifth, although the smaller 1.9 mm diameter cryoprobe initially fit through the 2mm diameter bronchoscopic channel, after several uses it no longer did. A replacement cryoprobe manifested the same defect. Sixth, although we did not encounter this problem, removal of blood clots can lead to recurrent or worsening of airway bleeding.\nTherefore, on a case by case basis, the potential benefit of clot removal must be carefully weighed against the risk of inciting or aggravating airway bleeding. Lastly, the operator must be aware that clinical deterioration may occur during the procedure, thus the procedure should be performed in an environment that has adequate staffing and an appropriately equipped room.\nOur study is limited by its relatively small size, retrospective nature, and limitation to a single institution. Also, cryoextraction was generally applied in cases in which blood clots and airway secretions could not be effectively removed by conventional flexible bronchoscopy. Therefore, it is difficult to know the optimal indications for its use.",
