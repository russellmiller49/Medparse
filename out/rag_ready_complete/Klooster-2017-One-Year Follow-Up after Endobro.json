Methods: Emphysema patients who have been treated with EBV in the STELVIO trial were invited for a voluntary 1-year follow-up visit. Both the original treatment group and the control group who crossed over to treatment have been included. Analyses are performed on the patients who attended the 1-year follow-up visit. Results: Sixty-four patients received EBV treatment. At 1 year, 40 patients (26 female; mean age 59 ± 8 years; FEV 1 0.86 ± 0.29 L; RV 4.56 ± 1.00 L; 6MWD 367 ± 78 m; and SGRQ 56 ± 13 points) visited the hospital. Significant improvements ( p < 0.001) were found for FEV 1 (+17%, 95% CI, 11 to 24), RV (-687 mL, 95% CI, -918 to -456), 6MWD (+61 m, 95% Received: August 13, 2016 Accepted after revision: November 15, 2016 Published online: December 15, 2016 demonstrate absence of interlobar collateral ventilation, as a basis for the success of this treatment. However, treatment success is also accompanied with some risk, particularly an approximately 20% incidence of the treated patients developing pneumothorax in the early postbronchoscopy phase. Another, less frequent complication was the loss of lung volume reduction due to granulation tissue formation around the valves and subsequent valve dislocation, raising the question of whether the risks for these complications continue to be present beyond 6 months of follow-up. The risk for pneumonia and exacerbations after obstructing the airways with a foreign body like the EBV is expected to be high, but the 6-month data of the STELVIO trial were reassuring in that perspective. Finally, one could anticipate that, since emphysema is a progressive disease, disease progression in the nontreated ipsilateral lobe may negatively influence the effects of successful lung volume reduction over the course of time. Successful lung volume reduction of the target lobe increases mechanical stress and overexpansion of the nontreated lobe and induces compensatory emphysema, associating with loss of the original lung volume reduction effect [4] . In other words: does lung volume reduction persist after 6 months of treatment? The aims of this uncontrolled study are to investigate the efficacy and safety of EBV treatment of the open-label STELVIO cohort at a 1-year follow-up. This follow-up study lacks a control group because the control group patients in the STELVIO trial were also crossed over and treated with EBV after their 6-month follow-up, as per the original study protocol. We included patients who were previously treated with oneway EBV in the 'STELVIO trial' (trial registration: NTR2876) [1] and had severe emphysema, hyperinflation, marked dyspnea irrespective of heterogeneous or homogeneous distribution, and a confirmed absence of interlobar collateral ventilation measured with the Chartis system .

Health-related quality of life was measured by the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) [8, 9]  , and dyspnea severity was measured by the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale   [10]  . The BODE score was calculated at baseline as well as after 6 months and 1 year of follow-up   [11]  . If patients did not visit our hospital for their followup, available spirometry data from other hospitals were collected. This was also necessary for patients whose valves had to be removed after treatment and for patients who were initially not treated with EBV due to either positive collateral ventilation or local airway anatomy not compliant with valve treatment. The baseline inspiratory high-resolution CT scan was used to assess emphysema distribution for the treated lung. Less than 15% difference in destruction score between treatment lobe and nontreatment ipsilateral lobe in the EBV target lung was defined as 'homogeneous' and more than 15% as 'heterogeneous'   [1]  .",

      "content": "One-way EBV treatment provides significant clinical benefits for carefully selected patients with severe emphysema,  a  patient  group  with  limited  treatment  options.\nOne year after EBV treatment, there were significant improvements  in  pulmonary  function,  exercise  capacity, and quality of life compared to baseline values. This improvement exceeded the established MCID with a high responder rate. The occurrence of a pneumothorax is a frequent complication in the acute posttreatment phase [1,  17,  18]  ;  however,  no  pneumothoraces  occurred  between the 6-month and 1-year visits. Seventy-eight percent of the initially treated patients retained the EBV over the 1-year study period, although 17% needed to undergo extra bronchoscopies with valve replacements to restore valve dysfunction.\nOur 1-year follow-up results show that the largest improvements in FEV  1  , RV, and SGRQ after EBV treatment are observed at 6 months after treatment, with a slight decline in these variables at the 1-year timepoint. However, the improvements for all endpoints, FEV 1 , RV, and SGRQ, at  1  year  remained  statistically  significant  with clinically relevant improvements compared to baseline. The slight decline in lung function parameters, noted primarily in the homogeneous and lower lobe cohorts, did not result in a decline in exercise performance between\nOf the 21 patients with homogeneous distribution, 15 patients received treatment in the lower lobe, and of the 19 patients with heterogeneous distribution, 3 patients received treatment in the lower lobe.

To adjust for multiple testing, p values <0.025 were considered to indicate statistical significance.

Possible causes of the observed lung function loss are ongoing progression of emphysema,  overexpansion  of  the  nontreated  ipsilateral lobe   [4]  , and loss of EBV function. The durability of the treatment effect of improved lung function after the first year  of  successful  treatment  with  EBV  needs  to  be  explored in larger studies with longer follow-up, which are currently underway (NCT01796392).\nImportantly, also at 1 year, the benefit from EBV treatment was maintained not only in patients with a hetero-\ngeneous emphysema distribution on high-resolution CT, but also in patients with homogeneous emphysema. Recently published data from a randomized clinical study in patients with homogeneous emphysema showed the benefits of EBV treatment at 3 months   [3]  . The present data provide important long-term (12 months) observations of persistent benefits in patients with homogeneous emphysema  with  limited  treatment  options  including  no surgical  alternatives,  with  the  NETT  trial  showing  that surgical lung volume reduction in patients with a homo-\ngeneous emphysema is associated with higher mortality as compared to medical controls   [19]  .\nPneumothorax  was  the  most  important  serious  adverse event in the first 6 months of the STELVIO trial, occurring  predominantly  during  the  immediate  posttreatment  period  when  patients  were  still  hospitalized and under observation. In this 1-year follow-up study, no additional pneumothoraces were observed between 6 and 12 months. Despite this encouraging observation, future pneumothoraces may still occur, although it will be difficult  to  discriminate  between  treatment-related  and spontaneous  pneumothoraces.  Another  device-related event after 6 months of follow-up was permanent valve removal because of valve dislocation due to formation of granulation tissue, resulting in complaints like coughing and loss of valve efficacy. Formation of granulation tissue in  response  to  implanted  devices  is  a  well-known  and therapeutically  challenging  problem,  also  encountered after placement of central airway stents   [20]  . Removing the valves indeed resolves this granulation tissue formation; however, the beneficial lung volume reduction effects also disappear. Importantly, follow-up spirometry data from patients who were not able to retain their valves\nshowed both FEV  1 and FVC values comparable to baseline values at a median of 399 days after valve removal. One might consider surgical lung volume reduction in patients who demonstrate significant initial clinical benefit from the valve treatment, but were unfortunate to develop local airway granulation formation, leading to permanent valve removal   [21]  .\nEight patients did not attend the 1-year follow-up visit, which could bias the outcome measures. Therefore, we collected  the  individual  spirometry  data  from  the  patients' local hospitals. For these data, the conditions under  which  spirometry  was  performed  were  not  know (pre-  or  postbronchodilator).  The  available  data  were predominantly assessed over more than 1 year after EBV treatment. The external spirometry data showed that only 1 patient had a decrease in both FEV  1 and FVC compared to baseline. In 4 patients, both FEV 1  and FVC and in 2 patients FVC were still improved compared to the baseline  values,  indicating  that  our  results  would  not  have been materially altered, even if they had visited our institution for their follow-up visit.\nOur study demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement in the BODE index at the\nSerious adverse events were all adverse events which were fatal, required or prolonged hospitalization, caused substantial risk of dying at the time of the event, resulted in permanent impairment of a body function, or required medical or surgical intervention to prevent permanent impairment of a body function. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n1-year follow-up. Two large randomized trials   [22, 23] using the same EBV demonstrated comparable results 6 months after treatment, but only in patients with intact fissures and successful lobar occlusion   [24]  . Patients who underwent lung volume reduction surgery also demonstrated similar improvements in the BODE index after 6 months. This improvement in the BODE index was associated with a significant decrease in mortality   [19]  . Prolonged survival of subjects treated with EBV who achieved lobar atelectasis was also suggested in multiple cohorts [25-27]  . While the data in our study has shown an improvement in the BODE index, suggesting a survival benefit, longer-term follow-up after EBV treatment is necessary to better investigate this potential survival benefit.\nThe uncontrolled study design after 6 months of follow-up in the present study is a limitation of our cohort study.  We  cannot  correct  for  potential  placebo  effects; however, the efficacy outcomes in the original STELVIO trial  were  controlled with patients who did not receive EBV treatment, and these patients did not show any improvement after 6 months of follow-up.\nA randomized controlled trial with a 1-year follow-up, ideally with a larger number of patients, would be useful to confirm our results. Another limitation is that not all patients who retained the valves were able to attend the voluntary  1-year  follow-up  visit,  resulting  in  a  smaller number of patients assessed at 1 year.\nIn summary, we present the 1-year follow-up results of patients with severe emphysema and absence of collateral ventilation who were previously treated with one-way EBV in the 'STELVIO trial.' We demonstrated clinically rele-\nvant  and  significant  improvements  in  pulmonary  function, exercise capacity, and quality of life, with good responder rates at 1 year after EBV treatment. An important observation is that no pneumothoraces occurred between 6 and 12 months of follow-up, in contrast to the 20% pneumothorax rate in the first weeks after treatment. Valve replacement or permanent valve removal can be required. We conclude that this 1-year follow-up study supports the use of EBV treatment in carefully selected patients with severe emphysema without collateral ventilation.",
