In 1987, the optical /uniFB01 bers in the bronchoscope were replaced with a video camera at its distal tip, leading to improved image quality and allowing for the use of a color video screen, instead of the eyepiece.\nIndications for bronchoscopy are myriad and include, among others, lung in /uniFB01 ltrates and masses, enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, endobronchial lesions, hemoptysis, cough, wheezing, stridor, and therapeutic aspiration of secretions. Although absolute contraindications to bronchoscopy are rare, relative contraindications include uncorrectable bleeding diathesis, unstable respiratory\nABBREVIATIONS: CMS = Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services; CPT = Current Procedural Terminology; cTBNA = conventional transbronchial needle aspiration; E/M = evaluation and management; EBB = endobronchial biopsy; Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) = endobronchial ultrasound; TBLB = transbronchial lung biopsy; TBNA = transbronchial needle aspiration; wRVU = work relative value unit\nAFFILIATIONS: From the Interventional Pulmonology Service (Dr Ninan), Touro In /uniFB01 rmary-LCMC Health, New Orleans, LA; and the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine (Dr Wahidi), Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC.\nCORRESPONDENCE TO: Momen M.

      "content": "The most basic diagnostic bronchoscopic procedure is inspection with a white light bronchoscope. The procedure is typically performed using moderate sedation and topical anesthetic agents for the upper airways and bronchial tree, and it allows for inspection of the trachea, main bronchi, lobar bronchi, and segmental airways. With smaller bronchoscopes, further subsegmental exploration is possible (ultrathin bronchoscopy). Airway inspection can identify hallmarks of speci /uniFB01 c diseases, such as mucosal aberrations, increased vascularity, bleeding, endobronchial lesions, and airway stenoses. All bronchoscopic procedures begin with a comprehensive airway examination followed by the basic diagnostic bronchoscopic procedures discussed in the following sections, which are often performed together during one procedural session. Table 1 provides the CPT code descriptors for the basic bronchoscopic procedures and their associated work relative value units (wRVUs).",

      "content": "BAL is commonly used to obtain samples for cytologic analysis of alveolar epithelial lining /uniFB02 uid as well as culture for presumed infections. It is a safe and easy bronchoscopic procedure to perform and usually well tolerated by even the sickest patients. Although the utility of BAL has been studied in several lung pathologies, it is most established in diagnosing malignancy and infections.\nBAL cell count may be useful in eosinophilic diseases involving the lung. A diagnosis can often be con /uniFB01 rmed with high clinical suspicion and an elevated eosinophil count on BAL, with or without peripheral blood eosinophilia. Such diseases include acute and chronic eosinophilic pneumonias, tropical eosinophilic pneumonia, and helminthic infections with pulmonary manifestations. 3\nFor diffuse lung diseases, a target site is often identi /uniFB01 ed based on examination of chest imaging prior to the procedure. 4 However, during the airway inspection, an appropriate site can sometimes be selected according to the presence of speci /uniFB01 c /uniFB01 ndings such as blood, purulent secretions, and mucosal abnormalities.\nThe bronchoscope is placed into the bronchial segment of choice and advanced to the most distal position until\n]\nit is ' wedged ' into the airway. This will usually represent a segmental or /uniFB01 rst subsegmental bronchus. Sterile saline is then /uniFB02 ushed through the working channel of the bronchoscope in aliquots and suctioned through the suction port into a specimen trap or into the syringe from which it was /uniFB02 ushed. A 2016 prospective randomized study found that manual aspiration into the syringe produces a larger quantity of aspirate compared with wall suction; however, diagnostic yields are similar regardless of the technique used. 5\nThe ideal amount of /uniFB02 uid is not known, but the minimum should be 100 mL given in 60-mL aliquots. 6 A larger volume of /uniFB02 uid will decrease the relative amount of airways:alveolar material sampled, because the same bronchial surface will be lavaged, but a larger alveolar area will be sampled. Standardizing the amount of lavage /uniFB02 uid will also aid in standardizing quantitative measurements of the sample. BAL return will vary based on multiple factors, including location of BAL, airway selected, dwell time, permeability, and airway collapse.",

      "content": "Originally performed through a catheter inserted through the nose 7 or via a rigid endoscope, 8 TBLB is now routinely performed through a /uniFB02 exible bronchoscope and is considered a basic diagnostic procedure for the pulmonologist. TBLB has been extensively studied in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis, 9,10 hypersensitivity pneumonitis, malignancy, infections, and interstitial lung disease. 11\nTBLB can be performed with or without /uniFB02 uoroscopic guidance. Although all rates of complications, including pneumothorax, are similar in those who undergo the procedure with or without /uniFB02 uoroscopy, 12 clinical practice has evolved into /uniFB02 uoroscopy being commonplace. The advantage to /uniFB02 uoroscopic guidance is con /uniFB01 rmation of the appropriate placement of the forceps as well as possibly detecting immediate postprocedure pneumothorax, negating the need for a postprocedure chest radiograph in asymptomatic patients. The bronchoscope is usually maneuvered into a distal position in the selected airway, and /uniFB02 exible forceps are advanced by the bronchoscopist until there is resistance, presumably having reached the pleura. The forceps should then be retracted 1 to 2 cm by the bronchoscopist and opened by the assistant. The bronchoscopist then advances the forceps forward onehalf the distance to the previously encountered resistance area and instructs the assistant to close the\nforceps. Gentle traction is then applied by the bronchoscopist and the forceps, and the lung tissue can be pulled through the working channel of the bronchoscope. The forceps should never be forced through the bronchoscope, especially while /uniFB02 exed, nor should they be opened while within the working channel because this action may damage the bronchoscope.\nThe number of biopsy samples taken will depend on the overall condition of the patient and the comfort of the bronchoscopist in performing TBLB. Diagnostic yields can vary based on the underlying pulmonary pathology and on the number of biopsy samples taken. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis, sarcoidosis, and lymphangitic carcinomatosis have the highest yields; while increasing the number of biopsies, 1-3 biopsies vs 6-10 biopsies, have a diagnostic yield of 38% and 69%, respectively. 13 The bronchoscopist should take into account the suspected pathology and the incremental risk of pneumothorax with an increasing number of biopsies when determining the appropriate number to perform. Five to seven biopsies should allow for an acceptable diagnostic yield and an acceptable risk/ bene /uniFB01 t ratio. 14 The size of forceps used has a signi /uniFB01 cant effect on the size of the biopsy specimens but does not seem to have a signi /uniFB01 cant effect on the diagnostic yield. 15,16",

      "title": "Transbronchial Needle Aspiration",
      "content": "Conventional transbronchial needle aspiration (cTBNA) is the least-used of the basic bronchoscopic procedures. 17 A lack of appropriate training, unproven concerns regarding the safety of the procedure, and low diagnostic yields in all but the most experienced hands have contributed to its underuse. 18 cTBNA has been studied extensively for the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer, 19 mediastinal and hilar lymph node biopsy, endobronchial disease, submucosal lesions, peripheral nodules, and mediastinal cysts and abscesses. 20\nToday, cTBNA has largely been replaced by endobronchial ultrasound (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS))-guided TBNA for mediastinal and hilar lymph node sampling due to realtime visualization and higher diagnostic yield. However, cTBNA continues to be a valuable tool for the bronchoscopist as it is commonly used with /uniFB02 uoroscopy in the diagnosis of peripheral lung lesions. 21 It remains a useful and cost-effective tool for diagnosing endobronchial lesions or masses that cause extrinsic compression of the airway that do not require linear Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) examination for localization. CT scanning is often\nperformed prior to the procedure to better delineate the relationship of the structures surrounding the tracheobronchial tree.\nFour techniques for cTBNA are available to the bronchoscopist. The bronchoscopists who frequently use cTBNA are likely to have a favored method; however, knowledge of all methods is important as circumstances requiring one to adapt or change techniques are common. The four techniques include: (1) the ' jabbing method, ' in which the needle is extended out of the sheath, and the bronchoscope is held in place while the needle and sheath are ' jabbed ' forward; (2) the ' piggyback method, ' in which the bronchoscope and extended needle and sheath are moved forward as one apparatus; (3) the ' hub-against-the-wall, ' in which the sheath is extended through the bronchoscope and placed against the bronchial wall at an angle of 45 degrees or greater at the target site, and the needle is advanced through the bronchial wall; and (4) the ' cough ' method, which is similar in technique to the jabbing method but, to have the needle penetrate the bronchial wall, the patient is asked to cough to provide the necessary force.",

Diagnoses of malignancy and sarcoidosis are most frequent.\nThe bronchoscopist visualizes the lesion in the airway and extends open forceps to the lesion and then closes them to grab hold of the lesion. Traction is then applied to the forceps to gather the sample. Alternatively, the bronchoscopist can torque his or her wrist while traction is applied; this method can sometimes allow for a larger specimen to be gathered. The forceps with the specimen can be withdrawn through the working channel of the bronchoscope, or the bronchoscope and forceps can be withdrawn as one unit if larger specimens are obtained. Direct forceps biopsy of a visible central lesion suspected to be malignant had a sensitivity of 74%, as shown in an analysis of 35 studies with a total of 4,507 patients. 22 When combined with cTBNA, the diagnostic yield can be as high as 96%. 18",

      "title": "Bronchial Brushing",
      "content": "Brushing as a means of cytologic sampling during bronchoscopy has been performed for > 40 years. 23 It is most often used today for sampling of endobronchial lesions, mucosal abnormalities, and peripheral\npulmonary lesions, most often in concert with /uniFB02 uoroscopy, radial-probe Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), or navigation bronchoscopy. Bronchial brushings have a diagnostic rate of 68% in visible central lesions and 41% in peripheral lesions. 24,25\nThe brush is contained within a catheter sheath to protect the brush from contamination as it is advanced through the working channel and to minimize loss of specimen as the brush is retracted. The sheath is advanced until it is outside of the working channel. The brush is then advanced through the catheter and maneuvered back and forth along the lesion several times to maximize cell collection. When sampling is complete, the brush is retracted into the sheath and withdrawn from the bronchoscope. The brush can then be smeared onto a slide for onsite cytologic analysis, agitated in saline or another appropriate medium to release the cytologic material from the brush, or cut directly into a preservative solution.\nCell recovery does not differ with increasing brush sizes, 26 but brushes with individual bristles < 0.1 mm in diameter are able to collect signi /uniFB01 cantly more cells than those with bristles $ 0.1 mm. 27\nBronchial brushing is performed in lieu of other techniques when the bronchoscopist is concerned about bleeding, presuming, often incorrectly, that it is safer than other techniques. However, bronchial brushing can produce signi /uniFB01 cant bleeding given the large surface area that the brush comes into contact with.\nBronchial brushing has been introduced into bronchial genomic classi /uniFB01 er testing. When a bronchoscopy is performed to diagnose a possible malignant pulmonary lesion in a current or former smoker, a brushing is performed at the normal main stem bronchus. If the bronchoscopic specimens from the primary lesion are negative for malignancy, bronchial genomic classi /uniFB01 er testing is then performed on the cytologic specimen obtained from the brush. The test has a high negative predictive value and, when the results are negative, can help avoid additional invasive testing. 28",

      "title": "Reimbursement",
      "content": "Billing for bronchoscopy, and procedures in general, is a moving target and subject to frequent updates and changes. This situation is largely due to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) adapting the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes to accommodate a rapidly growing /uniFB01 eld. Changes in the CPT codes for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, radial Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) use for\n[ 155#5\nCHEST\nMAY 2019\n]\nlocalizing peripheral lesions, and the de-coupling of moderate sedation from the bronchoscopy codes have all been discussed in previous issues of this series. 29,30\nReimbursement for bronchoscopic procedures has two components: professional for the proceduralist and technical for the hospital or the practice. Technical reimbursement can vary based on the setting in which it is performed: ambulatory vs hospital. The current discussion is related to bronchoscopy in the hospital setting and is focused on professional billing.\nCMS reimburses hospitals for procedures performed in the outpatient hospital setting (technical fees) based on Ambulatory Payment Classi /uniFB01 cation Groups. Proper coding and billing for bronchoscopy procedures can be complex, and they require the bronchoscopist to understand concepts speci /uniFB01 c to endoscopic procedures, use appropriate modi /uniFB01 ers, and keep abreast of the everchanging CPT codes. Precise documentation by the bronchoscopist is also extremely important, as coding relies mostly on the physician ' s procedure note.",

Blood loss and complications should also be documented.\nWhen performing forceps biopsies, the proceduralist should document whether the biopsy was performed via /uniFB02 uoroscopic visualization (TBLB) or direct visualization (EBB) and whether the obtained specimen is lung tissue or bronchial wall.

      "title": "Multiple Endoscopy Rule",
      "content": "In most bronchoscopy procedures, the bronchoscopist performs multiple sampling techniques such as airway inspection, BAL, and TBLB in a single session. When performing each technique separately, a single technique will be reimbursed fully by the payers. However, when using multiple techniques, only one CPT code is considered primary and fully paid while the rest of the codes are partially paid. The partial payment is\ndetermined by payers having designated airway examination (CPT 31622) as the base code in bronchoscopy. The partial payment per code relies on a formula that deducts the reimbursement for the secondary codes from the base code. The following example helps illustrate this reimbursement scheme.\nA 56-year-old man with a cough is found to have a dense, right lower lobe (RLL) reticulonodular in /uniFB01 ltrate on a CT scan of the chest. The pulmonologist decides a bronchoscopy is warranted, during which she performs an inspection of the airways, a BAL of the lateral segment of the RLL, and seven transbronchial biopsies randomly taken from all segments of the RLL.\nIn this case, the pulmonologist would bill CPT 31628 for the TBLB and CPT 31624 for the BAL. Note that the CPT code for airway inspection, 31622, is not required because it is built into the other more advanced codes. Let us assume that a particular payer pays the following professional fees: airway inspection CPT 31622, $150; BAL CPT 31624, $160; and TBLB CPT 31628, $190. In this case, TBLB CPT 31628 is considered the primary code because it is the most extensive intervention and is reimbursed fully at $190. BAL CPT 31624 is secondary, and its reimbursement will be subtracted from the base code ($160 -$150 ¼ $10). Airway inspection, CPT 31622, is considered inherent in the samplings represented by the other two codes (reimbursement, $0). Fluoroscopic guidance, regardless of whether it is used with TBLB, is bundled into CPT 31628 and not separately billed. The total reimbursement for this procedure is: CPT 31628 $190 þ CPT 31624 $10 ¼ $200.\nIt is important to know that some CPT codes are considered ' add-on ' and are not subject to the multiple endoscopy rules. For example, CPT 31632 is for TBLB performed in each additional lobe. These codes are usually paid fully on top of the other primary and secondary codes.\nIn the preceding example, if the pulmonologist had performed TBLB not only in the RLL, but also in the right middle lobe, then the payer would have reimbursed fully for it. If we assume that in the reimbursement for TBLB, each additional lobe code CPT 31632 is $50, then the aforementioned payment will change to: CPT 31628 $190 þ CPT 31624 $10 þ CPT 31632 $50 ¼ $250.",

      "content": "In the coding world, a service or procedure can be further described by using a two-digit CPT modi /uniFB01 er.\nThese modi /uniFB01 ers provide additional information about the procedure such as how many physicians worked on the patient, whether the procedure was repeated on the same day for a valid reason, where the procedure was performed on the body, and various other situations. Modi /uniFB01 ers provide clarity to the payer on these circumstances and ensure a smooth payment process. The coders usually apply modi /uniFB01 ers, but it is imperative for the bronchoscopist to understand them and periodically audit their use with their coding staff. Table 2 details some of the important modi /uniFB01 ers for bronchoscopy and related services.\nModi /uniFB01 er 59 (distinct procedural service) is applied when separate biopsies are performed on different sites or lesions during the same bronchoscopy procedure. Typically, TBLB and EBB are bundled together when performed on the same location. For instance, when a physician performs TBLB and EBB on a lesion in the RLL, the coding system will only accept the TBLB and will not allow the EBB to be coded. However, if the physician performed these techniques in different locations, say TBLB in the RLL and EBB of a different endobronchial lesion in the left upper lobe bronchus, modi /uniFB01 er 59 would then be attached to the EBB code to indicate a separate procedural service in a different area. Documentation must be clear about the varied locations. It should also be noted that different insurance carriers have varying requirements regarding how this modi /uniFB01 er is appended, and bronchoscopists and hospital coders should be aware of their local rules.\nModi /uniFB01 er 22 (unusual procedural services) indicates that the procedure was dif /uniFB01 cult, time-consuming, and required services signi /uniFB01 cantly greater than traditional service and, therefore, deserves additional reimbursement (typically increases the reimbursement by 20%-25%). This modi /uniFB01 er can be used with bronchoscopy but less commonly with basic bronchoscopic procedures. For instance, bronchoscopies\ncomplicated by extensive bleeding requiring considerable extra time to control on the part of the bronchoscopist could be eligible for modi /uniFB01 er 22 if documented thoroughly.\nModi /uniFB01 er 53 (discontinued procedure) is used to describe a procedure that is halted prior to completion as a result of an unexpected event or extenuating circumstances, placing the patient ' s welfare at risk. Appending modi /uniFB01 er 53 to bronchoscopy requires clear supporting documentation, including that anesthesia was induced (whether local, moderate, deep, or general), the bronchoscope was introduced, and the reason the procedure was discontinued. The reimbursement for procedures billed with modi /uniFB01 er 53 is based on how much of the procedure was performed according to the documentation.\nModi /uniFB01 er 25 denotes a signi /uniFB01 cant and separate identi /uniFB01 able evaluation and management (E/M) service by the same physician on the same day of the procedure. This scenario is common, in which the pulmonologist performs a consultation that results in performing a bronchoscopy on the referred patient on the same day. The physicians must append modi /uniFB01 er 25 to the E/M code to inform the payer that the E/M service was done separately and led to the decision to perform the procedure. Otherwise, the payer may mistake the E/M service for the preoperative health and physical examination that is typically bundled with bronchoscopy.",

As advances in technology lead to changes in our procedural practice patterns, CMS responds with coding changes to re /uniFB02 ect these new patterns. Although complex, understanding coding and billing for basic bronchoscopy will optimize hospital and physician reimbursement for procedures as well as help facilitate studies of disease prevalence, treatment, and outcomes.",
