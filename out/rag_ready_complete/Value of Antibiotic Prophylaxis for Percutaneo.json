Guidelines published by the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) (1 -3) recommend the routine use of\nprophylactic antibiotics before pull-through gastrostomy tube placement, but there is no consensus on the use of antibiotics for the push-type procedure (3). Prospective data to advise physicians on the appropriate use of antibiotics before this procedure are lacking. Owing to the nature of placing a catheter into a nonsterile organ (ie, the gastric lumen) via a percutaneous route, coupled with the potential long duration of catheter placement, the potential risk of skin infection is (3).\nProphylactic antibiotics before percutaneous gastrostomy (PG) tube placement (via a push technique) are not currently supported by prospective data (3). All existing studies in the IR literature regarding prophylactic antibiotic use before PG have been retrospective. One retrospective study (4) found that infection rates were 15% in patients not receiving prophylactic antibiotics. Another retrospective review (5) in which no patients received antibiotic prophylaxis demonstrated an infection rate of 3%.

Differences in infection rates may vary because of differences in patient population, technique, or use of prophylactic antibiotics, which was not uniform in these studies (3 -6).\nThere have been several randomized controlled trials examining the use of prophylactic antibiotics before percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) catheter placement via a transoral or pull technique (during which the device traverses the oropharynx) (7,8). One well-designed study (7) showed a statistically signi /uniFB01 cant difference in peristomal infection rates between patients receiving prophylactic antibiotics and patients receiving placebo (3% vs 18%). A different study (9) showed no difference in rates of infection between patients receiving antibiotics and patients receiving placebo. However, a modi /uniFB01 ed introducer, endoscopicassisted push type of PEG was used in this study compared with older PEG studies. The aim of the present study was to compare peristomal infection rates in patients undergoing PG who received a single dose of either antibiotic or placebo before the procedure and to examine peristomal infection rates in patients concurrently receiving antibiotics for the treatment of other infections at the time of PG placement.",

Informed consent to participate in the trial was required of all patients, and the study complied with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act guidelines. Randomization was performed by the pharmacy department using a random number generator to assign patients to treatment or placebo arms. The pharmacy department maintained a master log of enrolled patients, which was available to the study staff at the conclusion of the study. All patients, operators, nursing staff, and study staff were blinded to patient assignments in the randomization arm of the study.\nBetween May 2012 and February 2016, 517 patients underwent PG tube placement. Indication for gastrostomy tube placement was inability to meet adequate nutritional needs by mouth (eg, neurologic causes, head and neck cancer). All nonpregnant, English-speaking patients /C21 18 years old were eligible for the study. The institutional review board at the performing institution required in-person consent and English-speaking patients, which excluded many eligible patients. In addition, 24 eligible patients refused to participate in the study. Patients were eligible for randomization to antibiotic treatment or placebo only if they had not received antibiotics within 48 hours before PG placement. The remaining patients who were already receiving antibiotics at the time of enrollment for the treatment of other infections were assigned to the observation arm ( Fig ).\nThere were 34 randomly assigned patients in the placebo arm and 34 randomly assigned patients in the antibiotic arm\nincluded in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Two patients in the placebo arm, and 1 patient in the antibiotic arm were outpatients, and the remainder were inpatients. Separately, 54 patients already receiving antibiotics (all inpatients) were included in the observation arm. Indications for antibiotic therapy are listed in Appendix A (available online at www.jvir.org ).\nBaseline demographics of patients are summarized in the Table . There were no signi /uniFB01 cant differences in baseline patient characteristics among the 3 study groups. Patients assigned to the antibiotics arm received a single dose of antibiotic 30 minutes before the procedure: cefazolin 1 g intravenously (n ¼ 30) or clindamycin 600 mg intravenously (n ¼ 4) if allergic to b -lactams. Patients assigned to the placebo arm received a similar volume of normal saline 30 minutes before the procedure.

The appearance of the site was assessed using an established scoring system for categorizing stoma infections (7,10): presence of erythema (0, none; 1, /C20 5 mm; 2, 6 -10 mm; 3, 11 -15 mm; 4, /C21 15 mm), induration (0, none; 1, /C20 10 mm; 2, 11 -20 mm; 3, /C21 20 mm), and exudate (0, none; 1, small serous; 2, moderate serous; 3, large serous ± sanguineous; 4, purulent). The stoma site was considered infected if the combined score at the time of evaluation was /C21 8 or frank purulence was present.\nWhen in-person stoma site evaluation was not possible, such as when the patient had been discharged home or to a\nskilled nursing facility, 1 study member (either 1 attending IR physician [C.R.I.] or the physician assistant [E.L.A.]) contacted the patient or caregiver for evaluation. Generally, for patients in a skilled nursing facility, a nurse at the facility evaluated the patient with direct instruction from the study member by telephone.

Major complications included death, blood loss requiring transfusion, nontarget bowel transgression, septicemia, extraluminal tube placement, and peritonitis (11). Minor complications included minor bleeding not requiring transfusion and tube maintenance issues, such as tube dislodgment, kinking, clogging, or migration (12).",

Therefore, this study aimed to randomly assign 128 subjects (64 per arm) to detect a difference of approximately 20% between the antibiotic and placebo groups. With this sample size, across a range of infection rates, differences in infection rates of 20% (placebo arm) versus 3.5% (antibiotic arm), 25% versus 6.3%, or 30% versus 9.4% would be detectable with 80% power (2-sided a /C20 .05).\nApproximately 100 gastrostomy tube procedures are performed each year at the institution where the study was performed. The original study recruitment duration was expected to last approximately 2 years. Although the study originally planned to randomly assign 128 subjects, recruitment was substantially slower than expected owing to limitations of the patient population (eg, in-person consent and English-speaking patients only allowed) and the unexpectedly low rate of infection encountered. Therefore, the trial was stopped at 45 months after 70 patients were randomly assigned (approximately 19 per year -about 30% of the expected accrual rate).",

Infection rates and other outcomes were compared between study groups using the midP version of Fisher exact test (15). Infection rates were compared between the randomized placebo and antibiotic arms as the primary comparison. This comparison was performed as part of an ITT analysis and a per-protocol (PP) analysis. Under the ITT analysis, all randomly assigned patients except the patient with unknown treatment assignment and the patient with no follow up were included in the comparison of infection rates between the 2 arms ( Fig ). Under the PP analysis, the infection rates between the 2 arms were compared after excluding patients who received antibiotics for new sources of infection after enrollment unrelated to the PG placement ( Fig ). Those patients were excluded from the PP analysis, as the additional antibiotics may have reduced the infection rate relative to patients who received only prophylactic antibiotics or placebo according to the random assignment. Infection rates were also compared between the observation arm and the randomized arms as an exploratory analysis.\nCon /uniFB01 dence intervals (CIs) for infection rates were calculated using the midP version of exact Clopper-Pearson intervals (16). CIs for the differences in infection rates between groups were calculated using an approximation based on the midP CIs from each group (17). The number needed to treat with antibiotics to prevent 1 infection was calculated as the inverse of the difference in infection rates between groups that did and did not receive antibiotics.

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "content": "This study demonstrated a trend toward a reduction in the rate of early peristomal infection after PG placement when antibiotics are administered before the procedure. However, this conclusion is limited by the sample size of this study and an overall low infection rate in the study cohort. There is little evidence to support the routine administration of prophylactic antibiotics before most IR procedures (1,2). All previously published studies in the IR literature regarding antibiotic use before PG have been retrospective. In the PP cohort, the infection rates observed in this study of 0% in the prophylactic antibiotic group, 13% in the placebo group, and 2% in the concurrent antibiotic/observation group are consistent with infection rates in other studies reported in the literature (4,5,7). The PP analysis found a statistically signi /uniFB01 cantly lower rate of peristomal infection after catheter placement when antibiotics are given prophylactically compared with placebo ( P ¼ .049). The ITT analysis, which included multiple patients in each group who started antibiotics during the follow-up period, demonstrated a marginally nonsigni /uniFB01 cant difference in infection rates between the placebo and antibiotic groups ( P ¼ .057). Given that patients newly started on antibiotics are included in the ITTanalysis, potential infection could have been reduced in the placebo arm.\nA recent Cochrane review (8) of 13 randomized controlled trials examining the use of prophylactic antibiotics before PEG demonstrated that prophylactic antibiotics are effective at reducing peristomal rates of infection after the procedure. However, 2 more recent studies in the PEG literature (18,19) demonstrated no difference in the rates of peristomal infection between patients given prophylactic antibiotics and patients given placebo. Given the differences between the pull and push techniques, the present study aimed to examine if antibiotic prophylaxis was necessary in a patient group undergoing PG, given the differences in technique between PG and PEG.\nThe decision to administer prophylactic antibiotics depends on comparing the cost and morbidity of treating an infection that could potentially develop with the cost and morbidity of administering antibiotic prophylaxis (20,21). Proper use of antibiotics for primary prophylaxis must provide adequate coverage of the organisms most likely to colonize the surgical site, be safe to the patient, and be administered for the least amount of time to be effective and prevent the development of resistant organisms (21). Given the relatively low incidence of infection after PG placement observed by this study and others and the low morbidity associated with a peristomal infection, one could argue that it is not necessary to treat all patients with prophylactic antibiotics. Should a peristomal infection develop, it could be easily treated with a short course of antibiotics. However, the infection rate in the placebo arm reached 13%, which supports the use of a prophylactic antibiotic.\nThis study has several limitations. Nearly 400 patients were excluded because of consent and language requirements of the study. Slow recruitment led to terminating the study before enrolling the projected number of subjects. Lower than expected infection rates in combination with a small sample size gave the study less power than originally planned. One consequence of the lower sample size is that CIs for the difference in infection rates between the antibiotic and placebo arms were relatively wide, indicating notable uncertainty of the magnitude of the clinical impact of antibiotic prophylaxis. Initiation of new antibiotics for the treatment of other infections during the follow-up period interfered with the comparison of the study arms (the ITT analysis did not reach signi /uniFB01 cance, and the sample size thus became further reduced in the PP analysis). Patients in the observation arm were on several different antibiotic regimens for the treatment of different infections, creating variability in the coverage of skin /uniFB02 ora. Patient follow-up after discharge from the hospital was sometimes challenging, as many patients were either outpatients or discharged from the hospital before 30 days. Even with a very thorough verbal description of the clinical /uniFB01 ndings that were being used for stoma evaluation, telephone follow-up was suboptimal compared with evaluation by someone on the research team. Many patients were discharged to skilled nursing facilities, and clinical and stoma site care after discharge was likely variable and inconsistent. Ten patients were lost to follow-up after day 10 of the follow-up period (5 in the randomized arm and 5 in the observation arm), and there is a potential for missed late infections in the patients lost to follow-up. Pigtail catheters were used for all feeding tubes, which may differ in complication rates from other types of feeding tubes, such as balloon-retention devices. Similarly, 3 T-fasteners were used in all cases, which may be considered excessive. This was done to keep the procedural technique consistent throughout the study period. Finally, this study included patients with cancer, and immune status as a potential risk factor for infection was not evaluated in a separate subgroup analysis.\nIn conclusion, this study demonstrates a trend toward reducing the rate of peristomal infection following percutaneous gastrostomy placement after administration of a single dose of antibiotic given as prophylaxis before the procedure.",

All patients underwent sterile preparation of the abdomen consisting of chlorhexidine 2% -isopropyl alcohol or povidone-iodine (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey). All patients underwent PG by push technique performed by an attending physician and fellow trainee in the IR department. All patients received either moderate or deep sedation for the procedure. Glucagon 1 mg (Boehringer Ingelheim, Ingelheim, Germany) was administered intravenously before stomach insuf /uniFB02 ation. After insuf /uniFB02 ation of the stomach with air via the nasogastric tube and administration of 1% lidocaine for local anesthesia in the chosen gastrostomy tube site, 3 absorbable gastropexy sutures (SAF-T-PEXY T-fasteners) were placed. Centered within the gastropexy sutures, an 18gauge needle was inserted into the gastric lumen under /uniFB02 uoroscopic guidance. Over a stiff wire (Amplatz Super Stiff Guidewire; Boston Scienti /uniFB01 c, Marlborough, Massachusetts), a 16-F Deutsch Gastrostomy Catheter (Cook Medical) was placed over the wire. The pigtail was formed in the gastric fundus. A Molnar Retention Disc (Cook Medical) was sutured to the abdominal wall using a nonabsorbable suture to\nsecure the tube. A 4 cm /C2 4 cm split dry gauze sterile dressing was placed underneath the Molnar disc adjacent to the skin on completion of the procedure. Cloth tape (3M Medipore; 3M, St. Paul, Minnesota) was then used to secure the edges of the dressing to skin. The tube was connected to gravity drainage, and the patient was given nothing by mouth until after evaluation the following morning.",

The patient experienced tracheal aspiration during tube feeding on day 7 after the procedure and died on day 10 after the procedure from overwhelming pneumonia. One minor complication occurred in the placebo group when a patient ' s tube was unintentionally pulled out on day 10 after the procedure and required replacement the next day.\nOne minor complication occurred in the antibiotics arm after 24 hours; the patient experienced minor bleeding at the stoma site on day 4 after the procedure, which resolved on its own and required no further intervention. One major and 3 minor complications occurred in the observation arm after 24 hours. The major complication was a signi /uniFB01 cant bleed in the gastric fundus on day 2 after the procedure, thought to be secondary to the pigtail of the tube eroding the surrounding gastric mucosa. This patient required endoscopic intervention and surgical replacement of the tube. The patient had a myocardial infarction on day 5 after the procedure. The patient ultimately died 17 days after the procedure from multiorgan failure. The 3 minor complications consisted of catheter replacements in 2 patients (1 catheter was obstructed and 1 catheter was pulled out) and a tube in 1 patient that eroded the surrounding skin and had become dislodged, requiring replacement.\nDuring the 30-day follow-up period, 3 patients in the placebo arm (8.8%), 1 patient in the antibiotics arm (2.9%), and 4 patients in the observation arm (7.4%) died. Only the death in the patient who experienced signi /uniFB01 cant bleeding after the procedure could be directly attributed to the gastrostomy tube procedure (in the observation arm).\nSuggested thresholds for major complications and minor complications per SIR guidelines are < 5% and < 25%, respectively (11). For major complications, including death and bleeding requiring transfusion, suggested thresholds are < 1% and < 3%, respectively (11).
