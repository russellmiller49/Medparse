      "content": "Lung cancer is well recognized as the most common cause of cancer-related death [1].\nSurgery in this condition has traditionally been regarded as the mainstay of treatment and the only curative modality aimed at local-regional control of the disease. The use of surgery has been limited in many patients who present with locally advanced disease. Over the last 20 years preoperative chemotherapy has been increasingly used to downstage the tumor and enhance its respectability. Although there is no convincing evidence at present that preoperative chemotherapy is able to convert initially irresectable and/or inoperable tumor into one amendable to surgical resection. However since 1990s, multiple clinical trials of neoadjuvant chemotherapy showed mild improvement in survival vs. only surgical methods [2-6]. From that point of view photodynamic therapy represents an attractive additional modality to achieve preoperative downgrading of the tumor with the aim to facilitate its respectability. For example, two Japanese [7,8] and one American [9] study demonstrated that preoperative photodynamic therapy (PDT) can lead to less extensive pulmonary resections. These studies included small number of patients and did not comment on radicality of surgery.\nThe therapeutic effect of PDT is based on selective accumulation of photosensitizing agents (PSA) in cancer tissue. Subsequent irradiation of the neoplastic lesion with the light of wavelength that lies within PSA absorption range results in release of singlet oxygen with structural alteration and necrosis of the tumor [10,11]. Since the US Food and Drug Administration approved PDT for the treatment of microinvasive endobronchial non-small cell lung cancer in early 1998 and advanced partially obstructing endobronchial lung cancer in late 1998 [12], there has been increasing interest in using PDT alone or in combination with standard therapeutic or palliative modalities to treat Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [13].\nThe aim of this study was to assess effectiveness of neoadjuvant endobronchial PDT when combined with chemotherapy in downgrading of the tumor and facilitating surgical resection of locally advanced and initially irresectable and inoperable Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).",

      "content": "From January 2008 to December 2011 42 patients (36 male and 5 female; median age 66 years, range 43-86 years), were included. 21 were randomized to the PDT arm and 21 -to the No-PDT arm. There was no significant difference\nbetween two groups in respect of age, sex, tumor stage, and histological characteristics (Table 1).\nThe reasons why patients were considered unsuitable for surgical resection at the time of initial presentation are summarized in Table 2. There were: the tumor spread to the trachea (19), as well as intolerance to pneumonectomy (10). Six patients had CT signs of great vessels invasion. The remaining 7 patients had metastases in mediastinal lymph nodes proved by mediastinoscopy. In total mediastinoscopy was performed in 24 patients, N2 disease was diagnosed in 10, N3 -in 2 patients.\nTumor was localized the right main bronchus in 12 (29%) patients, left main bronchus -in 11 (26%), tracheal bifurcation -in six (14%) and distal tracheal segment -in 13 (31%) patients. 12 (29%) patients had complete occlusion of the main bronchus with atelectasis of the affected lung.\nThe mean level of FEV1 was 69 ± 17% predicted in PDT arm and 71 ± 19% predicted in No-PDT arm. All functionally inoperable patients (6 in PDT arm and 4 in No-PDT arm) were candidates for pneumonectomies. In these patients the level of FEV1 was 29 ± 6% predicted (from 19% to 37%), DLCO -52 ± 9% predicted (from 41% to 78%) in PDT arm and 27 ± 4% predicted and 56 ± 5% predicted in No-PDT arm, respectively.\nThe average duration of PDT session to reach the desired radiation dose was 11.5 min (range from 9 to 14). Complications of PDT were observed in 2 (10%) out of 21 irradiated patients who developed hemoptysis. This complication was regarded as minor and did not require hospital admission. None of the patients had abnormal cutaneous or retinal reaction which could have been attributed to photosensitivity.\nPlanned chemotherapy was completed in 36 (86%) patients. In six patients (14%) (three in each group) it had to be discontinued due to the either toxicity ( n = 5) or disease progression with the development of distant metastases ( n = 1). Less severe adverse effects such as neutropenia occurred in 26% (28% in PDT arm and 24% in No-PDT arm), anemia and thrombocytopenia (6 patients) did not interfere with chemotherapy regimen.\nThe observed response of tumor to neoadjuvant treatment is outlined in Table 3. 35 (83%) patients had partial response (19 (90%) in the PDT arm and 16 (76%) in NoPDT arm). Patients in PDT arm had higher rate of partial radiological ( p = 0.158) and endoscopic ( p = 0.249) response, although the difference between two groups failed to reach statistical significance. Fewer patients had no response in the PDT arm.\nThe mean level of FEV1 improved insignificantly after neoadjuvant treatment in 10 initially inoperable patients in both groups. In PDT arm it has increased by 10% (from 29 ± 6% predicted to 32 ± 12% predicted) and in No-PDT arm -by 7% (from 27 ± 4% predicted to 29 ± 6% predicted). The level of DLCO also remained unchanged. It was more important that 8 of these 10 patients (5 in the PDT arm and 3 -in the No-PDT one) unfit for pneumonectomy due to poor pulmonary function were able to have lobectomies instead due to tumor disappearance from main bronchus (Fig. 1).\nPost-treatment bronchoscopy showed complete disappearance of the tumor in seven patients after PDT (33%) and only two without PDT treatment (10%) ( p = 0.054). Of importance in planning the extent of subsequent resection, neoadjuvant treatment led to complete recanalisation of trachea with no visible tumor in 16 out of 19 patients who had initial tracheal involvement (nine out of nine (100%) of PDT arm and seven out of 10 (70%) of No-PDT arm, p = 0.124).\nIn two patients with N3 disease contralateral mediastinal lymphadenopathy has resolved in the PDT arm.\nIn accordance with the trial protocol 19 patients in PDT arm and 16 in No-PDT arm had sufficient response and proceeded with the surgical treatment. In 32 patients resection of the tumor proved possible and in the remaining three cases procedure was limited to explorative thoracotomy only (Table 4).\nPreoperative PDT allowed significantly higher proportion of patients to be offered radical (R0) resection in comparison with No-PDT arm in 17 of 19 (89%) patients vs. seven of 16 patients (54%) ( p = 0.038). Histological analysis of the pattern of microscopically incomplete excision (R1) invariably showed the residual disease in the bronchial stump in no other surrounding structures. There were no cases of macroscopically incomplete resection (R2).\nPotential influence of combined chemotherapy and PDT on the extent of subsequent resection was analyzed as a secondary endpoint. Both PDT and No-PDT neoadjuvant treatment regimens led to less extensive resections (lobectomy instead of pneumonectomy and pneumonectomy instead of carinal pneumonectomy) reducing surgical risks. Four of 8 patients who underwent lobectomy instead of pneumonectomy had microscopically incomplete resection -one patient of the PDT arm (20%) and all patients (100%) of the No-PDT arm ( p = 0.142).\nIntraoperative frozen section of bronchial margin was done in six from eight patients with further established\nR1 resection. Expedited evaluation in two cases out of six showed no cancer cells, i.e. false-negative result incidence was 33%. Out of other four patients two underwent re-resection and in both cases new resection margin was found to be cancer positive again. In remaining two cases repeated surgery was rejected due to the need for wide tracheal resection. Post-surgery morphological evaluation showed mucosal disease in bronchial resection margin in one patient, submucosal one -in three patients, and peribronchial vessel one -in four.\nThere was one post-surgery death in each group. Causes of death were pneumonia and Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation. Both\npatients had pneumonectomy. One patient from PDT arm had tracheobronchial anastomosis failure treated conservatively. No other serious complications were noted.",

      "content": "Many prospective randomized trials found trends for survival improvement in favor of preoperative chemotherapy followed by surgery vs. surgery alone in stage III Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients [3-5].\nHowever, there is no consensus on the major issue for all surgeons whether preoperative chemotherapy improves\nsurgical resection results and operability. About one-third of Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients has stage III disease often characterized by irresectable locally advanced tumor or would not stand surgery due to functional issues (i.e. are functionally inoperable). In theory, after special preparation some of these patients can undergo surgery. For example, in patients with limited pulmonary function (who would not tolerate pneumonectomy) it would therefore be beneficial to reduce the extent of resection.\nIn this paper, we discuss possibility to extend indications for endobronchial PDT as one of components of neoadjuvant treatment. In other words, patients with locally advanced disease may be treated with PDT to enhance resectability or to reduce the required resection extent.\nThe PDT mechanism of action has been extensively previously described though there is still no complete understanding of its therapeutic effects in oncology [10,15]. Method of PDT has a great deal of advantages. PDT can be applied in outpatient settings; it can be combined with conventional therapies; PDT can be employed when other methods are already ineffective; mutations as a source of resistance to chemoor radiation therapy do not affect PDT efficacy; treatment toxicity is minimal, especially due to development of new photosensitizers [16]. Despite these advantages, limitations of PDT include patient photosensitivity following therapy, risks in case of bronchogenic tumors invading large vessels, and dependence of treatment on cancer location and size. Some of these limitations as our study shows can be overcome due to development of new photosensitizers in the recent years [17].\nPDT has been employed even before as a means to reduce the extent of planned resection or to convert originally inoperable patients to surgical candidates. However, among various medical publications we managed to find only three such works -two from Japan published in the previous century and one from the USA (2006) [7-9]. In the latter PDT and chemoor radiation therapy were applied as induction treatment in 41 Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients including 78% with stage III disease. Thus, 57% of patients considered as unresectable underwent surgical resection and 27% initially requiring pneumonectomy underwent lobectomy [9]. It should be noted that the study did not pay sufficient attention to resection completeness issues.\nWhen cancer affects a main bronchus or trachea, resection margin is located quite closely to cancer tissue growth border. No cancer is large bronchi after preoperative treatment does not guarantee no cancer cells in mucosa, submucosa or peribronchial lymph nodes. All those cases sometimes result in clinical situations when elective morphological evaluation producing reports usually in several days after surgery showed cancer cell complexes in resection margin. Preoperative autofluorescence bronchoscopy may be useful to determine the exact required level of airway resection [18]. But if doing more aggressive bronchial (tracheal) resection is not possible due to technical or functional reasons, prevention of such clinical issues dramatic both for patients and surgeons may be an indication for preoperative PDT facilitating additional cancer cell death along with chemotherapy.\nOur study demonstrated that neoadjuvant PDT treatment along with chemotherapy is effective, safe and it makes possible to convert to surgery candidates and to improve\nresection completeness in patients initially considered as unresectable or inoperable.\nAlthough our results should be interpreted with cautions taking into account our small patient sample, no data concerning follow-up are provided. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first randomized one evaluating DT effectiveness in neoadjuvant mode. We hope that this study will provide physicians with relevant evidence-based information and enhance their interest to PDT as a treatment modality for lung cancer and cancer disease in general.",
