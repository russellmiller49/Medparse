      "content": "Momen M. Wahidi, MD; Felix J. F. Herth, MD; Alexander Chen, MD; George Cheng, MD; and Lonny Yarmus, DO\nInterventional pulmonology (IP) has evolved over the past decade from an obscure subspecialty in pulmonary medicine to a recognized discipline offering advanced consultative and procedural services to patients with thoracic malignancy, anatomic airway disease, and pleural disease. Innovative interventions are now also available for diseases not traditionally treated procedurally, such as asthma and emphysema. The IP /uniFB01 eld has established certi /uniFB01 cation examinations and training standards for IP training programs in an effort to enhance training quality and ensure competency. Validating new technology and proving its cost-effectiveness and effect on patient outcomes present the biggest challenge to IP as the health-care environment marches toward value-based health care. High-quality research is now thriving in IP and promises to elevate its practice into patient-centric evidence-based care.\nKEY WORDS: bronchoscopy; interventional pulmonology; lung biopsy; lung neoplasm\nMore than 10 years have passed since the initial publication on the state of the art in interventional pulmonology (IP) in this journal. 1 Much has changed in this past decade. IP is now a well-recognized subspecialty of pulmonary medicine with a focus on advancing the care of patients with thoracic malignancy, airway disease, and pleural disease via minimally invasive techniques and innovative approaches. 2 IP training programs grew at an exponential\nrate to reach more than 40 available annual training positions; to ensure quality training, the IP community standardized fellowship training and accreditation and created a board examination for certi /uniFB01 cation. 3-6 Innovations in IP have led to the development of therapeutic options for benign and malignant disease. Novel minimally invasive procedural interventions for asthma and Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration\nABBREVIATIONS: AABIP = American Association for Bronchology and Interventional Pulmonology; APC = argon plasma coagulation; BLVR = bronchoscopic lung volume reduction; BTPNA = bronchoscopic transparenchymal nodule access; CAO = central airway obstruction; CBCT = cone-beam CT; DNase = deoxyribonuclease; DPLD = diffuse parenchymal lung disease; Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) = endobronchial ultrasound; EC = electrocautery; EM = electromagnetic; ENB = electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy; ETTNA = electromagnetic guidance transthoracic needle aspiration; FDA = Food and Drug Administration; IP = interventional pulmonology; IPC = indwelling pleural catheter; PT = percutaneous tracheostomy; R-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) = radial Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS); RFA = radiofrequency ablation; SLB = surgical lung biopsy; TBNA = transbronchial needle aspiration; tPA = tissue plasminogen activator\nAFFILIATIONS: From the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine (Drs Wahidi and Cheng), Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC; the Department of Pneumology and Critical\nCare Medicine (Dr Herth), Thoraxklinik and Translational Lung Research Center, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany; the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (Dr Chen), Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO; and the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (Dr Yarmus), Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.\nFUNDING/SUPPORT: The authors have reported to CHEST that no funding was received for this study.\nCORRESPONDENCE TO: Momen M.

      "title": "Therapeutic Bronchoscopy",
      "content": "Therapeutic bronchoscopy is indicated for the relief of central airway obstruction (CAO) located in large airways (trachea, mainstem bronchi, and bronchus intermedius). The goal is to provide relief of symptoms or, occasionally, a lasting cure for early localized cancers (carcinoma in situ) or benign lesions. The main cause of CAO is malignancy (primary lung cancer or metastases from extrathoracic cancers), but other nonmalignant conditions can be seen (in /uniFB02 ammatory, infectious or sequelae of arti /uniFB01 cial airways). Patients often present initially with cough and exertional dyspnea, then progress with increasing severity of obstruction to resting dyspnea; stridor; hemoptysis; postobstructive infections; and, ultimately, asphyxiation. 7\nThe speci /uniFB01 c intervention in the airways is tailored to the type of airway lesion, generally divided into exophytic growth (intrinsic), extrinsic compression from adjacent growths, or a combination of both diseases. Mechanical debridement and ablative therapy are most appropriate for exophytic lesions, whereas bronchoplasty and stent placement are best suited for extrinsic compression. Rigid bronchoscopy is preferred over /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopy for therapeutic procedures because the rigid bronchoscope has a larger diameter that allows for effective suctioning and the removal of large pieces of tissue, there is also the ability to ventilate through the scope, and the barrel of the scope is useful in coring out tissue and dilating stenoses. Most bronchoscopists use a combination of rigid and /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopic techniques in which the /uniFB02 exible scope is used through the rigid scope for better visualization of distal lesions or easier articulation in curved or tortuous airways.",

      "title": "Ablative Therapy: Laser, Electrocautery, Argon Plasma Coagulation, Cryotherapy",
      "content": "Ablative therapy in the airway consists of both hot (laser, electrocautery [EC], and argon plasma coagulation [APC]) and cold (cryotherapy) modalities. The ideal lesion for ablative therapy is intraluminal and\nshort ( < 4 cm) and has con /uniFB01 rmed aeration in lung areas distal to it (on the basis of CT scanning or bronchoscopic visualization). Although heat therapy can be used to vaporize the tumor, it is used more commonly to coagulate the tumor before mechanical resection to control bleeding. The neodymium:yttriumaluminum-garnet laser was introduced in 1980s and has been the main heat modality used in the airways. 8 However, its use has decreased over the past decade in favor of other modalities. EC is a modality that uses an electric probe to conduct an electric current to heat the target tissue directly. EC is perceived as an alternative that is cheaper and easier to use than is laser and that also can be combined with accessories such as an EC knife and EC snare to provide effective ways to cut webs or snare polypoid lesions, respectively. 9-11 APC is an alternative noncontact electrocoagulation technique in which a high-frequency current meets with argon gas at the tip of probe to generate a plasma jet that heats tissue. APC is predominantly a coagulation technique because its depth of effect is limited to 1 to 3 mm. With all heat modalities, there is the concern for airway ignition when performed under high oxygen conditions. Thus, decreasing the FIO 2 to < 40% is recommended when heat ablative modalities are used. 9,12\nCryotherapy started as a modality to destroy tissue by rapidly freezing it to a very cold temperature ( < /C0 40 o C). However, it gradually fell out of favor because it required repeated freeze and thaw cycles on the target lesion and had delayed effects, making it unsuitable for rapid relief of CAO. Instead, a new application of cryotherapy emerged. Cryoadhesion is a technique in which the cold temperature of the probe is used to adhere to the tissue, with the probe then being abruptly withdrawn, thereby retrieving the attached tissue. This technique can be used to remove luminal tumor tissue (cryocanalization), blood clots, mucous plugs, or foreign objects. 13,14\nThe data on the ef /uniFB01 cacy of ablative therapy in the airways is limited but, overall, show a high success rate in achieving luminal patency ( > 90%), relief of shortness of breath and a low rate of complications. 15-17 Figure 1 illustrates a typical case of therapeutic bronchoscopy in CAO.\nOther modalities, such as brachytherapy and photodynamic therapy, have a delayed therapeutic effect and often are not suitable for situations in which immediate relief of airway obstruction is desired. Both modalities now are used less commonly because of cost, burdensome procedural steps, and unfavorable adverse\nevent pro /uniFB01 les (prolonged skin photosensitivity and fatal hemoptysis in photodynamic therapy and massive hemoptysis, radiation bronchitis, and airway stenosis in brachytherapy). 18",

      "title": "Mechanical Debridement and Bronchoplasty",
      "content": "Mechanical debridement of endobronchial lesions can be achieved with /uniFB02 exible forceps, large rigid forceps, the beveled tip of the rigid scope, cryoavulsion or with the\n[\n]\nuse of a microdebrider. Debridement with /uniFB02 exible forceps is most effective for smaller lesions in the distal airways because it could be quite time-consuming for larger airway masses. Debridement with the beveled tip of the rigid scope is used in the central airways for lesions that are short with a clear distal lumen, although caution must be exercised to avoid damage to the airway wall. 19\nThe microdebrider uses disposable rotating blades that can shave and suction protuberant tissue. Advantages to this method include its rapid action and the ability to debride and suction tissue at the same time. The main limitations are the rigid shaft and short length of the blades, which limit their maneuverability and access beyond the trachea and proximal mainstem bronchi. 20\nBronchoplasty, or bronchial dilatation, can be achieved with the barrel of the rigid scope or with balloons inserted via the /uniFB02 exible scopes. It is most commonly used for dilatation of stenotic airways or disruption of webs related to nonmalignant causes of airway diseases. This method generally leads to immediate relief of the stenosis, but results are usually short-lived. Mucosal tears and minor bleeding are expected and common. Rupture of airways and vessels may occur if proper techniques are not followed. 21\nAnother technique commonly used for concentric benign tracheal stenoses incorporates the use a neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser or EC to produce radial cuts in the stenotic web. This technique is then followed by bronchoplasty. This combined approach can result in mucosal sparing and potentially more durable results. 22",

      "title": "Airway Stents",
      "content": "Reports of endoscopically implantable stents for the airways date back to 1914. 23 The implantation of the /uniFB01 rst dedicated silicone stent in the airway was reported by Dumon in 1990. 24 There are currently three types of stents available: metallic (uncovered or partially covered), silicone, and hybrid (silicon and metallic elements). Airway stents are commonly used to treat patients with CAO due to extrinsic compression from a variety of malignant and benign disorders. 7 Stents are effective and lead to relief of symptoms in CAO in > 90% of patients (Fig 2). 25 However, effects may not be durable, and complications are not uncommon, especially when stents are placed for benign disorders or remain in place for an extended time. 17 Complications with airways stents include migration, tumor\novergrowth, infections, granulation tissue formation, and mucous plugs. 26,27\nBare metallic stents can embed quickly in normal mucosa and become dif /uniFB01 cult to remove, so they can cause complications with consequences more dire than those of the original airway disease. Therefore, it is not advisable to place them for benign disorders for which life expectancy is long; the FDA issued a black box warning cautioning against the use of metallic stents in patients with benign tracheal disorders. 28\nFirst generations of biodegradable stents, threedimensional printed tailored stents, and drug-coated or drug-delivering stents currently are being evaluated and have been used in small series. These options promise to move IP into a personalized medicine approach in which stents are tailored to an individual patient ' s airway anatomy. 29-31",

      "content": "Convex endobronchial ultrasound (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)) was /uniFB01 rst used in the airway in 2003 and has rapidly become the gold standard for mediastinal sampling. 32 Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) provides a sonographic view that is parallel to the long axis of the bronchoscope and allows for real-time visualization during transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) of mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes and masses adjacent to the airways (Fig 3). Since its introduction, the evidence has been mounting for the superior performance of this technology in sampling mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes and has led it largely to replace conventional TBNA and, to some extent, mediastinoscopy.\nMultiple studies have illustrated that Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA has a pooled sensitivity of roughly 90% and speci /uniFB01 city of 100% in the staging of non-small cell lung cancer. 33 The 2013 CHEST lung cancer guidelines recommended Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA over surgical staging as the initial test for mediastinal staging of known or suspected lung cancer. 33 Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA also has a similarly high yield for intrathoracic lymph nodal metastases from extrathoracic malignancies.\nOf equal importance, the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA technique also has been well proven to obtain tissue samples that are adequate to perform molecular pro /uniFB01 ling for targeted therapies in lung cancer, with adequacy rates for testing that exceed 95%. 34 A 2016 CHEST guideline statement summarized best conditions and optimal technical\nperformance to achieve maximal diagnostic yield and adequate tissue for various tests. 35 Other studies have shown that although the sensitivity of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for pulmonary sarcoidosis is relatively high, 36 it is lower for the diagnosis of lymphoma (sensitivity of 55%). 37",

      "title": "Peripheral Bronchoscopy",
      "content": "Substantial effort has been made toward advancing the diagnostic yield of bronchoscopy for peripheral pulmonary lesions. A 2012 meta-analysis inclusive of more than 3,000 patients suggested that the diagnostic yield of guided bronchoscopy for peripheral lesions was approximately 70% regardless of the method used. 38 However, more recent data, including a prospective study of more than 600 patients undergoing guided bronchoscopy for peripheral lesions, revealed that procedures were nondiagnostic in more than 40% of patients. 39 Therefore, efforts continue to determine the true diagnostic yield of advanced guided procedures and\n[\n]\nthe optimal application of these techniques to improve diagnostic yields in the periphery.\nUltrathin bronchoscopy is the use of smaller bronchoscopes to facilitate improved access to the lung periphery. Oki and colleagues 40 performed a prospective randomized controlled trial comparing the use of a 4mm-outer-diameter thin bronchoscope and guide sheath with an ultrathin 3-mm-outer-diameter bronchoscope with a 1.7-mm working channel for the diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary lesions. Both arms used radial Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) (R-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)) and virtual bronchoscopic navigation, and the authors demonstrated a statistically signi /uniFB01 cant increase in the diagnostic yield with use of the 3-mm bronchoscope (74% vs 59%; P ¼ .044), as well as increased peripheral reach by approximately one generation of bronchus. 40\nR-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) uses a small, radial scanning ultrasound probe that is inserted through the bronchoscope ' s working channel and into the lung parenchyma. One contribution of this technology has been the discovery that successful biopsies in the periphery are contingent on overcoming multiple variables. A large retrospective study demonstrated that despite successful R-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) con /uniFB01 rmation of peripheral lesions in 446 of 467 (96%) of patients, the diagnostic yield in this population was 69%. 41 This disconnect between localization and successful biopsy may be explained by anatomic relationships in the periphery. A concentric ultrasonographic view indicates that the peripheral lesion surrounds the bronchus, whereas an eccentric view indicates that the lesion is positioned adjacent to the bronchus (Fig 4). When a concentric view is obtained, the diagnostic yield of procedures with use of R-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) exceeds 80%, compared with diagnostic yields\nof approximately 40% when an eccentric view is obtained. 42\nElectromagnetic (EM) navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) describes image guidance systems that manipulate thinsection CT images to create virtual airway reconstructions that are used as maps during bronchoscopy. ENB systems also incorporate sensors that are tracked within an EM /uniFB01 eld during procedures. The patient ' s airway reconstructions and sensors are aligned using automated or manual registration algorithms, and the bronchoscopist is provided with a pathway to peripheral lesions, as well the ability to follow the location within the EM /uniFB01 eld. Experience using ENB systems has enhanced the understanding of the lung periphery during procedures, most notably the dynamic nature of the lung with respiration. One study quanti /uniFB01 ed movement of peripheral lesions between full inspiration at CT scanning and end-exhalation during tidal volume breathing in which peripheral lesions moved approximately 24 mm in the lower lobes and 11 mm in the upper lobes, although the clinical effect of this remains unclear. 41 A recent multicenter registry revealed a 12-month diagnostic yield of ENB of 73%. 43\nEM guidance has been applied to transthoracic approaches. This approach has been used previously for liver biopsies and more recently has been applied to the lung. A feasibility study in which EM guidance transthoracic needle aspiration (ETTNA) was performed using EM guidance for peripheral lesions in 24 patients achieved a diagnosis in 20 of the 24 (83%) patients, with a pneumothorax rate of 21%, and 2 patients (8%) required tube thoracostomy. 42 The combined approach of mediastinal staging by using Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, ENB, and ETTNA in suspected cases of early stage lung cancer\ncurrently is being investigated in a prospective, large, multicenter study.\nBronchoscopic transparenchymal nodule access (BTPNA) is a procedure in which navigational software is used to construct a direct pathway from a proximal bronchus through lung parenchyma to access peripheral lesions. Once the pathway has been constructed, the bronchoscopist uses a needle and dilation balloon to tunnel through pulmonary parenchyma to the peripheral lesion. A feasibility study in using BTPNA in 12 patients undergoing planned resection for possible early stage lung cancer obtained a diagnosis in 10 (83%), and subsequent evaluation of the resected lung did not show any immediate complications. 44 Additional studies of BTPNA are ongoing and are warranted to validate the safety and ef /uniFB01 cacy of this approach.\nCone-beam CT (CBCT) scanning, a compact CT scanning system with a moving C-arm, can be used intraprocedurally during bronchoscopy to provide realtime con /uniFB01 rmation of biopsy device location. A prospective study of bronchoscopy with a thin bronchoscope, R-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), and CBCT scanning in 20 patients showed that post-CBCT scanning maneuvers (redirecting sampling tools to the lesion based on CBCT images) increased the diagnostic yield from 50% to 70%; the mean estimated effective dose of radiation to patients from CBCT scanning ranged from 8.6 to 23 mSv. 45 The body of evidence about CBCT scanning is slim but promising; its added value and safety need to be con /uniFB01 rmed with larger prospective studies. However, adoption of CBCT scanning may be low given its cost and lack of availability in most endoscopy suites.",

      "title": "Pleural Interventions",
      "content": "Pleural procedures ranging from pleural ultrasound to medical thoracoscopy remained an active area for research and clinical development in the past decade. Indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) have gained tremendous popularity and have been declared by evidence-based guidelines to be as acceptable as chemical pleurodesis for the management of symptomatic malignant pleural effusions. 46 When comparing IPCs and pleurodesis via talc slurry, two multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trials demonstrated that IPCs effectively relieved dyspnea and decreased hospital stay and need for future procedures. 47,48\nEarly data showed that the use of an IPC can lead to spontaneous pleurodesis, albeit often delayed, in up to\n50% of patients. 47,49 Early spontaneous pleurodesis with an IPC decreases supply cost and risks of catheter failure and infection and achieves the patient ' s freedom from a catheter. 50 Hence, there have been efforts to understand factors that promote the rate of spontaneous pleurodesis. In a multicenter, randomized, singleblinded trial, patients who underwent daily drainage had a 24% increase in the spontaneous pleurodesis rate, occurring 36 days earlier when compared with every-other day drainage. 51 In a similar effort, the IPC-PLUS study evaluated the addition of talc slurry through an IPC compared with use of an IPC alone; the authors demonstrated a 20% improvement in the pleurodesis rate with talc slurry through an IPC within the /uniFB01 rst 5 weeks, without any additional adverse events in the outpatient setting. 52\nPleural infections (empyema or complex parapneumonic effusion) are commonly encountered in clinical practice. The mainstay of therapy used to consist of antibiotics, drainage of the infected pleural space with tube thoracostomy, and possibly surgical decortication. The landmark Multi-Centre Intrapleural Sepsis Trial 2 demonstrated that twice-a-day intrapleural sequential administration of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and deoxyribonuclease (DNase) improved /uniFB02 uid drainage in infected pleural effusions, reduced surgical referrals, and decreased hospital stay. 53 More recent studies aiming at reducing the complexity of the treatment regimen have showed that concurrent instillation of tPA and DNase could be as safe and as effective. 54,55 A 2017 observational trial showed that starting with a reduced dose of intrapleural tPA (5 mg) and DNase (5 mg) in treating pleural infection is feasible, 56 although prospective comparative trials are needed to con /uniFB01 rm whether these modi /uniFB01 ed schedules of administrations can be validated.\nMedical thoracoscopy or pleuroscopy has a diagnostic yield > 95% when used to evaluate lymphocytic exudative effusions without a clear cause (Fig 5). 57 Since its introduction, the procedure has evolved such that it now is performed with the patient under moderate sedation and as an outpatient treatment with excellent outcome. 58,59 Narrow-band imaging and tissue auto /uniFB02 uorescence have been used in pleuroscopy to assess the pleura for targeted biopsy quickly. 60,61 Techniques to facilitate larger pleural biopsies by using a diathermy knife, hybrid knife, and cryobiopsy have been described. 62-64 None of the mentioned techniques have yet been validated with comparative trials to assess their added clinical value.\n[\n]",

Limited experience with bronchoscopic radiofrequency ablation (RFA) exists, focusing mainly on feasibility and safety. 73,74 A longer-term study that treated 20 patients with nonsurgical early stage lung cancer with bronchoscopic RFA illustrated a local control rate of 82.6%, median progression-free survival of 35 months, and 5-year overall survival of 61.5%; three patients required hospitalization for acute ablationrelated reaction (fever, chest pain), and all improved with conservative treatment. 75\nBronchoscopic microwave ablation also has been proposed as a potential means to treat early stage lung cancer. Bronchoscopic microwave ablation therapy has potential advantages over RFA, such as decreased treatment time and less susceptibility to the thermodilution generated by the heat sink effect of the circulation in adjacent vasculature. 76 Limited experience has been reported using bronchoscopic microwave therapy, and a pilot study was halted secondary to safety concerns (NCT03603652), which highlights the critical importance of rigorous protocol design and implementation. Ultimately, the ef /uniFB01 cacy of bronchoscopic ablation of early stage nonoperable lung\ncancer must be proven in longitudinal studies (at least 5 years) demonstrating noninferiority in survival compared with that of the current gold standard of stereotactic body radiation therapy.",

      "title": "Bronchoscopic Lung Volume Reduction",
      "content": "During the past decade, several bronchoscopic therapeutic modalities have been tested in patients with severe emphysema to mimic the physiologic effects of surgical lung volume reduction in a less invasive fashion. Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (BLVR) via valve placement is a technique that was approved in the United States by the FDA in 2018 (Fig 6). This approach involves placement of one-way valves in the most destructed lung lobe, allowing air and mucus to exit and blocking air entry to achieve lobar collapse. The biggest challenge to this approach is the network of collateral ventilation that may be connecting the target lobe to adjacent lobes, rendering anatomic airway blockage ineffective. Overcoming this obstacle requires assessing collateral ventilation via chest CT scanning (on the basis of the completeness of the /uniFB01 ssures separating adjacent lobes) or bronchoscopic measurement of the air /uniFB02 ow of the occluded bronchus of the target lobe. Several clinical\n[\n]\ntrials on BLVR with valves have demonstrated improvements in lung function, as well as overall improvement in quality of life and exercise tolerance. 77 However, these bene /uniFB01 ts came at the cost of a pneumothorax rate of 14.2% to 26.6%. 78\nAlthough BLVRs are approved in the treatment of patients with severe emphysema, caution should be exercised in careful patient selection and attentive postprocedural care. Realistic expectations should be set with physicians and patients because the bene /uniFB01 ts of this approach are variable in magnitude and durability is unknown.",

      "title": "Cryobiopsy",
      "content": "Cryobiopsy is a new technique in which the cryotherapy probe is extended into the periphery of the lung, cooled for a few seconds to cause lung tissue to adhere to its tip, and then removed along with the adherent tissue to obtain a large piece of lung tissue with minimal crush artifact. Cryobiopsy has shown bene /uniFB01 t in establishing the diagnosis in diffuse parenchymal lung disease (DPLD) for which traditional transbronchial lung biopsy has performed poorly and surgical lung biopsy (SLB) has had a high complication rate. A speci /uniFB01 c pathologic diagnosis was obtained in 87% of a large cohort of patients with DPLD. 79 A recent study cast some doubt on the usefulness of cryobiopsy by comparing it with SLB performed sequentially in one procedure in 21 patients with DPLD; the study results showed poor concordance between the two modalities, with SLB being more frequently concordant with the /uniFB01 nal diagnosis as agreed on by a multidisciplinary team. 80 In addition to DPLD, reports on cryobiopsy usefulness in cancer, after lung transplant, and in immunocompromised hosts are emerging. Early experience with cryobiopsy was fraught with a high complication rate and even death. 81\nHowever, other clinicians have used safer techniques by using endotracheal tubes or rigid scopes, placing endobronchial blockers, using short freezing times of 3 to 5 s, using /uniFB02 uoroscopy, and maintaining a 1-cm safe distance from the pleura. Pneumothorax and severe bleeding are now estimated to occur at 9.5% and 1.1%, respectively. 82 A 2016 study investigating a minicryoprobe that can acquire samples through the working channel of a bronchoscope showed preservation of histologic quality with the promise of improved safety in an animal model, with human trials underway. 83\nIn 2018, an international conference on transbronchial cryobiopsy published an expert statement on its safety and usefulness, including a call for the standardization\nof this procedure. 84 Although cryobiopsy has great potential, questions remain about optimal procedural technique, patient selection, and safety pro /uniFB01 le; additional studies are needed to understand its role fully. An American College of Chest Physicians evidencebased guideline has been recently published to help standardize the practice and techniques of cryobiopsy. 82",

With that privilege and enthusiasm comes a great responsibility. First, IP has the scienti /uniFB01 c and moral obligation to validate new technology. The 510(k) FDA clearance pathway allows new medical devices with no substantial data to be used in patients as long as the devices are shown to be substantially equivalent to a currently FDA-approved device. This option is a blessing and a curse. The blessings come from the acceleration of technology access for patients in need, but the perils come from the relaxed requirement for generation of data to prove safety and ef /uniFB01 cacy.\nIn addition, new technology can involve substantial capital cost and require careful evaluation of added value before adoption. Although it is exciting to have innovations in the /uniFB01 eld, it is incumbent on the IP community to take the lead on careful assessment of new technology in terms of long-term safety, clinical usefulness, and ef /uniFB01 cacy and cost-effectiveness.\nSecond, the ability to perform quality multicenter trials still is limited by the nature of IP, but a major step was taken with the establishment of the Interventional Pulmonary Outcome Group (IPOG), a cohesive evidenced-based group for systematic assessment of each new technology. Ideally, the community as a whole should come together to develop a universally accepted approach to document, store, and access all IP procedural data. Doing so will enable large-scale data mining for hypothesis generation, quality improvement, and practice-changing studies.\nFinally, we must ensure the quality of training for the next generation of IP physicians. In addition to\nprocedure competency, standardized curricula, and certi /uniFB01 cation examinations, we must ensure that the training for and practice of IP are grounded in evidencebased medicine.",
