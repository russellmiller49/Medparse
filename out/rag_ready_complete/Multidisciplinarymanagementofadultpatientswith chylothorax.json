      "content": "Chylothorax is defined as the accumulation of chyle in the pleural space, resulting from obstruction or disruption of the thoracic duct or one of its major tributaries. Traumatic chylothorax conventionally\nCopyright ©The authors 2024. For reproduction rights and permissions contact permissions@ersnet.org\nencompasses iatrogenic post-surgical causes such as after cardiothoracic surgeries or trauma that leads to injury to the thoracic duct. Malignancy is the most common cause of non-traumatic chylothorax [1, 2]. Patients with chylothorax, especially those with large-volume accumulation, can present with significant respiratory symptoms, with subacute dyspnoea being the most common symptom [3]. Prolonged high-output chylothorax is associated with high morbidity and mortality due to the consequent nutritional losses, associated immunocompromised state and large intravascular volume fluctuations. Thus, patients with chylothorax require close monitoring as well as aggressive interventions for both symptomatic relief and to prevent further complications. The existing evidence on chylothorax management is largely retrospective, predominantly single centre and skewed toward traumatic chylothorax. There are no guidelines, and consequently, there is significant heterogeneity in practice [1]. This is evidenced by a recent study that evaluated 77 patients with predominantly non-traumatic chylothorax [3]. In this study evaluating real-world practice, dietary measures were infrequently followed (36%), only 3% patients underwent lymphangiography and no patients underwent thoracic duct ligation (TDL) or thoracic duct embolisation (TDE) [3].\nThus, the aims of this multidisciplinary consensus statement are: 1) guidance for the management of patients with chylothorax, 2) address the knowledge gaps and 3) identify areas for future research. The scope of this document is limited to the multidisciplinary management of adult patients with either traumatic or non-traumatic chylothorax. The diagnostic approach, including laboratory tests, pleural fluid and serum studies and imaging modalities, is beyond the scope of this document. In addition, our best practice statements specifically address the management of chylothorax, and may not be extrapolated to that of chylous ascites. Medical management of chylothorax refers to conservative measures such as dietary modification, pharmacological therapy or use of total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Definitive interventions for chylothorax include surgical TDL or image-guided TDE. We refer to leaks as high or low output if >500 or <500 mL·day -1 , respectively. Leaks that persevere for >2 weeks are considered as persistent in this document. These empiric cut-offs cannot be extrapolated to every clinical scenario, and management pathways are best determined by physicians at the bedside evaluating trends in daily output.",

      "content": "This consensus statement on managing adult patients with chylothorax was developed using a comprehensive and systematic approach, involving global experts. The methodology utilised the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) checklist to search and synthesise the evidence. The core writing group (A. Agrawal, U. Chaddha, S. Shojaee, G. Nadolski, M. Liberman and F. Maldonado) formulated seven clinically pertinent PICO (Patient, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome) questions relevant to the management of chylothorax in adults. These questions were designed to guide the literature review and evidence synthesis. An exhaustive literature search was conducted using PubMed. The search strategy included a combination of MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms, and selected studies are presented in the supplementary material. The PRISMA flow diagram (figure 1) illustrates the process of study selection, including the number of records identified, screened, included and excluded, along with reasons for exclusion at each stage. The search covered the time period from 1 January 1980 to 29 August 2023.\nWe included studies that involved the management of adult patients with chylothorax, as our research questions specifically pertained to this demographic. Paediatric cases were excluded to maintain relevance to the adult population. We included primary research studies that provided empirical data relevant to our PICO framework. This ensured that the evidence directly addressed our research questions. We excluded reviews and commentaries to ensure that our analysis was based on original research findings rather than secondary interpretations. Non-human studies were excluded as our focus was on human clinical outcomes. Studies that did not align with specific populations, interventions or outcomes as defined by our PICO framework were excluded. We excluded case reports and series of fewer than 10 patients if studies with better evidence were available to minimise potential biases associated with smaller sample sizes. If further robust prospective and retrospective data were available for the PICO question, we excluded smaller series and case reports. If no robust prospective or retrospective data were available, then smaller series and reports were evaluated to guide best practice statements. Statistical analysis was not performed due to the heterogeneity of study designs, interventions and outcomes, and lack of sufficient data.\nOnce the records were identified, the core group formulated summary of evidence tables based upon the studies. These were then used to formulate the best practice statements based upon the available evidence along with the rationale for the same. Summary of evidence tables for each PICO question, outcomes evaluated and risk of bias evaluations (using the Newcastle -Ottawa Scale) are provided in the supplementary material.",

The multidisciplinary panel of 27 experts included 12 pulmonologists, seven interventional radiologists, seven thoracic surgeons and one nutritionist from 20 hospitals across five countries (USA, Canada, England, Australia and India), all of whom have experience managing chylothorax. The document was revised based on comments from all 27 members and subsequently discussed during a conference call, with 56% participation (15 members). During the conference call, individual suggestions were reviewed and incorporated in real time. The modified Delphi technique, a widely accepted method for developing consensus among experts, was used [4 -6]. A survey that incorporated the questions and revised statements was sent to all panel members. The panel anonymously and independently rated the appropriateness of the statements on a 5-point Likert scale. Consensus was defined a priori as ⩾ 70% agreement (4 or 5 on the Likert scale), with a minimal response rate of 80%. The results of the survey were tallied and reported to the group. There was 100% survey participation and consensus was achieved on all best practice statements (tables 1 and 2).",

      "content": "Dietary modifications can reduce the volume of chyle production, which in turn allows for any present lymphatic injury site to heal, potentially avoiding additional invasive interventions. NPO should lead to near-complete cessation of chyle flow. A MCT diet can be used to provide essential fatty acids as they bypass the lymphatic system and can be absorbed directly through the portal vein. A high-protein diet is recommended due to losses of protein from the chyle, as well as to assist with meeting overall caloric needs.\nIn small studies of chylothorax post-lung resection, about two-thirds of patients responded to either complete cessation of oral intake and TPN [7] or low-fat diet (<10 g·day -1 ) [8]. In a more recent study of 37 patients who developed post-operative chylothorax, chyle output dropped to <500 mL·day -1 in 76% (28 out of 37) of patients 24 h after institution of a low-fat diet [9].\nCessation of the fat-containing enteral diet and institution of TPN prevented surgical intervention in 36% (28 out of 77) of patients in a relatively large series of post-operative (all-comers) chylothorax [10], similar to other small, retrospective post-operative chylothorax series using TPN with NPO [11, 12]. A systematic review that assessed various nutritional management strategies in patients with chylous ascites and/or chylothorax revealed that while 72% of patients responded to conservative measures, there was no significant difference between the type of dietary intervention and the rate of resolution [13]. This study did not evaluate outcomes based on the aetiology of the chylothorax. In addition, some patients also received non-nutritional interventions such as chemical pleurodesis, diuretics and somatostatin which likely confounded the outcomes.",

Dietary modifications should be considered when the chyle leak may spontaneously resolve ( e.g. iatrogenic). Retrospective studies have suggested that dietary modifications play a significant role in patients with traumatic chylothorax and may reduce the need for surgical intervention. While data are limited for non-traumatic chylothorax, these suggestions may be extrapolated to this group. However, caution must be exercised in malnourished patients. Fat-soluble vitamin supplementation and essential fatty acid supplementation equal to 2 -4% of daily caloric intake are recommended in patients with prolonged restricted diets, as deficiencies can occur in as little as after 5 days of treatment.\nA low-fat diet with MCTs is associated with better tolerance and lower risk of complications compared to TPN. In patients who do not respond to dietary modifications, TPN may be considered on a case-by-case basis, especially in patients with traumatic chylothorax.\nPICO: Patient, Intervention, Comparison and Outcome; TDL: thoracic duct ligation; TDE: thoracic duct embolisation; IPC: indwelling pleural catheter. # : there was 100% survey participation (27 members) and consensus was achieved on all questions (table 2). 26 members participated in answering all questions, while input from the nutritionist member of the group was included for PICO Question 1.\nContinued\nBecause diet should be individualised and adequate nutritional supplementation provided, a nutrition consultation is suggested for all patients.

Other drugs such as orlistat, etilefrine and midodrine have also been used in the management of chylothorax. Orlistat inhibits gastric and pancreatic lipase in the gastrointestinal tract to reduce absorption of fats. Midodrine and etilefrine cause vasoconstriction of the lymphatic system, which can help reduce drainage in patients with high-output chylothorax. The data supporting the use of midodrine, etilefrine and orlistat are limited to case reports and small retrospective series [14 -17].\nA 2015 systematic review of 19 studies that assessed the use of octreotide in patients with post-operative chylothorax concluded that it is effective in the management of moderate to large chylothorax [18]. A study of 41 patients with chylothorax following pulmonary resections and lymphadenectomy reported a success rate of 90% (37 out of 41) in reducing chyle production with octreotide [19]. It is unclear whether the chylothorax was high or low volume in these cases. In another retrospective study of 20 patients with post-oesophagectomy-related chylothorax, the success rate was higher in those who received octreotide compared to those who did not (87% versus 40%; p=0.03) [20]. Other than these two studies, the systematic review included mainly case reports and animal studies [18 -20].",

Among all the agents tried, use of somatostatin analogues is the most described. Local availability and cost considerations must be factored into such decision making on a case-by-case basis. Further studies are needed to clarify the role, if any, of these agents. Somatostatin analogue use is not a part of routine clinical practice of the majority of authors on this document.",

In a study of 34 patients with non-traumatic chylothorax, periodic thoracentesis was used in 62% (21 out of 34) of patients [23].

Our suggestions on chest tube placement are for those in whom there is no already existing tube in situ ( e.g. post-operative patients). Chest tubes not only obviate the need for repeated thoracenteses, but also allow the clinician to accurately monitor the rate of fluid re-accumulation. Prolonged high-output chyle evacuation via a chest tube can, however, have the potential downside of leading to nutritional deficiencies and immune suppression. Serial thoracenteses may be considered for slowly accumulating effusions and based on patient and provider preferences [1]. ' Slow ' is loosely defined and best assessed at the bedside as a function of output and patient symptoms.\nThere are no studies evaluating the optimal chest tube size in patients with chylothorax, although the use of small-bore chest tubes ( ⩽ 14 Fr) has been described in case series [24 -26]. Experience with chest tube size in other pleural effusions and extrapolating data from studies with other aetiologies of non-malignant pleural effusions suggests that a well-positioned, small-bore chest tube should suffice [27 -29].",

      "content": "Surgical management of chylothorax usually involves ligating the thoracic duct or one of its culprit tributaries, using a minimally invasive approach (video-assisted or robotic-assisted thoracic surgery). Identification of the site of leak can be facilitated by giving the patient cream/fat prior to the surgery, or subcutaneously injecting a lipophilic dye such as Sudan black, indocyanine green or methylene blue [30 -32]. Duct ligation can be supplemented with pleurodesis at the end of the surgery.\nIn one of the first large reports of post-operative chylothorax, 72% (34 out of 47) of patients failed medical management and needed a re-operation, which was successful in 91% [11]. An initial oesophageal surgery (89% (24 out of 27)) and chylous output of >1000 mL·day -1 for 7 days predicted the need for re-operation. The need for re-operation for chylothorax after pulmonary resection is reportedly lower (19 -57%) than after oesophageal surgery [12, 33]. Small case series have suggested that early surgery may reduce the high mortality rate in patients who have a chylothorax after oesophageal surgery [34 -36]. Complications with re-operation, such as prolonged air leak, atrial fibrillation or prolonged ventilation, were noted in up to a third of patients in an older series; however, mortality remains low [11]. The development of chylous ascites after TDL has rarely been reported [37].\nIn a more recent 2018 report of 97 patients with post-operative chylothorax, TDL was successful in 85% (44 out of 52) [10]. Interestingly, the duct could be clearly identified in only 63% (33 out of 52), with mass ligation being performed in the remaining 37% (19 out of 52). Four percent of the surgical cohort (two out of 52) required TDE as a salvage procedure. Among those who underwent a diagnostic lymphangiogram, a leak could be identified in 85% (34 out of 40). However, the cisterna chyli could be cannulated in only 48% (19 out of 40), and TDE was successful in 79% (15 out of 19). Eight percent (three out of 40) needed TDL as a salvage procedure. Prior to the publication of this study, a 2017 meta-analysis of 407 patients undergoing lymphatic interventions (using pedal lymphangiography) for chylothorax reported that total occlusion of the lymphatic system could be achieved in 63%, and cessation of the chyle leak was achieved in 79% of these (with higher success in traumatic cases) [38]. Thoracic duct disruption (TDD) was attempted in 25% (77 out of 310) of patients who failed TDE and was successful in 61% (47 out of 77). TDD involves causing mechanical disruption of an adequately sized retroperitoneal lymphatic collateral(s) when the thoracic duct/cisterna chyli cannot be adequately identified or accessed. In a single-centre series, TDE was shown to successfully treat patients with persistent chylothorax after TDL with a reported clinical success rate of 90% (45 out of 50) [39]. The use of intranodal lymphangiography augmented by the use of pneumatic compression devices on the calves has resulted in improved rates of thoracic duct cannulation [40].\nTDE, in general, is a safer alternative to TDL, with complications such as embolisation of the embolic agent to the lung being only rarely reported.

      "content": "Chylothorax remains an uncommon complication after thoracic surgery and trauma, with an incidence of <3% in both [42]. In post-operative cases, TDL is successful in ∼ 90% and therefore may be considered over TDE in re-operative candidates [8, 10, 11, 22, 43]. However, reports of TDL for blunt or penetrating trauma are limited to case reports or series, and an extrapolation of the success of surgery to these cases cannot be made. There are no comparative data on TDL versus TDE. While an initial surgical approach is usually considered, the window to re-operate may be narrow and TDE has been shown to be successful even after failed TDL. Therefore, a multidisciplinary discussion on the best intervention remains key.\nPatients post-oesophagectomy are likely to have injury to the main thoracic duct and not a tributary, and are therefore likely to have higher volumes of chyle leak. Thus, these patients are less likely to respond to medical management alone [10, 11, 21]. In cases with a high volume of chyle leak, an early (within 5 days) re-operation, before complications such as malnutrition and immune suppression ensue, may reduce operative complications [36, 44]. In addition, early in the post-operative period the pleural space may be free of adhesions, thereby allowing easier identification of the site of chyle leak [1]. Even for patients undergoing TDL, medical management should be continued in the peri-operative period. For patients managed without a re-operation [10], if the output persists, TDL or TDE should be pursued,\nbefore complications of prolonged chyle leak ensue. TDE is a safe alternative to TDL in patients who fail TDL or are not (re-)operative candidates, and depending on local expertise may be considered before TDL on a case-by-case basis after multidisciplinary discussion [41]. Only when TDE is attempted but is technically unsuccessful can TDD be considered in as a salvage intervention during the same procedure; however, evidence for the same is limited.",

      "content": "Published literature on definitive interventions for non-traumatic chylothorax is scarce. Based on subgroup analysis of small published series, definitive interventions such as TDL or TDE were needed in 25 -50% of cases of non-traumatic chylothorax that fail conservative management [23, 45 -48]. Surgical correction was needed in 56% (19 out of 34) of patients in one of the larger series in 2010; however, 50% (17 out of 34) of patients had re-accumulation or persistence of chylothorax at the end of the study period [23]. In a more recent 2023 study that evaluated practice patterns of primarily non-traumatic chylothorax, only 3% of the patients underwent a lymphangiogram and none of the patients underwent a TDE or TDL [3].\nLymphangiogram with viscous oil-based contrast agents is often performed to identify the site of chyle leak prior to definitive interventions. Interestingly, this alone may be sufficient to resolve the chyle leak in 30 -70% of cases (including traumatic and non-traumatic patients) [49, 50]. In a large meta-analysis, technical success of TDE translated into clinical success in only 50% of patients [38]. Dynamic magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the lymphatic system can characterise the location and source of lymphatic leaks prior to intervention. In a case series utilising MR lymphangiography to evaluate non-traumatic chylothorax, TDE was clinically successful in 93% (38 out of 41) of patients in whom the imaging revealed abnormal lymphatic flow [51].",

      "content": "The most common causes of non-traumatic chylothorax are malignancy and primary lymphatic disorders creating malformed and/or aberrant lymphatic vessels in the chest, and many of these patients are poor surgical candidates due to either comorbidities or the diffuse nature of the leak. Furthermore, non-traumatic cases likely often involve thoracic duct tributaries, which may explain the lower success rates of TDL and TDE in these patients.\nIn patients with low chylous output, without complications, the need for any intervention over medical management should be based on the likelihood of response to aetiology-directed treatment. When response to disease-directed therapy or systemic anticancer therapy is expected ( e.g. chylothorax secondary to lymphoma), symptom-guided effusion management should be pursued. Definitive management should be considered when the low output is persistent (>2 weeks) in a patient where limited treatment response is expected, or when high-volume chylous output continues for a prolonged period (>7 days), before complications ensue. Early referral to centres of expertise should be considered.",

However, even the largest study reports the use of pleurodesis in only 27 patients [21]. TDL has been performed in combination with pleurodesis, with one recent study reporting using this in 65% (35 out of 54) of post-operative cases [10].

Extrapolating from the malignant pleural effusion literature [55, 56], pleurodesis using talc slurry can also be considered as an alternative to thoracoscopic instillation of a sclerosing agent, especially in borderline surgical candidates and those in whom percutaneous lymphatic interventions are not feasible or unsuccessful, considering that these patients are all already likely to have a chest tube.

      "content": "In patients with chylothorax refractory to medical, surgical and percutaneous lymphatic management, reports detail the successful use of a pleuro-peritoneal shunt to manage the effusion in both children and adults [12, 22, 57, 58]. This allows chyle to be diverted into the peritoneum from where it is absorbed systemically. These shunts cannot be considered in patients with concomitant chylous ascites, as their abdominal lymphatics are already overwhelmed by the chyle in their peritoneal cavity. The use of pleuro-venous shunt has also been described for patients with non-traumatic chylothorax [59 -61]. Although less invasive alternatives than TDL, these shunts can be associated with complications including infection, skin erosion, migration, shunt failure, pneumoperitoneum, air embolism and ongoing dietary and immune complications [58, 59, 62].\nDespite the contraindication per device instruction use [63, 64], the off-label use of tunnelled IPCs for non-malignant chylothorax has recently gained popularity largely due to the ease of placement and low rate of major complications of the intervention (minor complications are not uncommon). In a small study (n=14), no significant adverse nutritional, haemodynamic or immunological outcomes were reported during follow-up. The use of IPCs has been described for chylothorax related to malignancies such as lymphoma, while awaiting systemic anticancer therapy to take effect or for those with poor response to treatment [65, 66].",

      "content": "This consensus statement intends to offer guidance on the multidisciplinary management of chylothorax. The strength of this statement is that it summarises all current evidence on this topic and is the first document that provides guidance on the multidisciplinary management of chylothorax, representing the evidence and perspectives of experts from 20 institutions across the world. The limitations of this document arise from the poor quality of the existing evidence. Therefore, most of our best practice statements are either supported by evidence of low quality or purely based on expert consensus. Besides, clinical success rates of definitive interventions for single-site chyle leak aetiologies ( e.g. iatrogenic) may not be extrapolated to diffuse chyle leak syndromes; the management of each of these is beyond the scope of this document. Multicentre prospective data, comparative studies and randomised controlled trials are needed to generate higher quality evidence to better guide the management of chylothorax. We anticipate that as further evidence is generated, there will be a need to reassess our practice periodically, building on the suggestions presented in this consensus statement.\nAcknowledgement: We thank Kristine Alpi of the Gustave L. and Janet W.

If expertise in percutaneous lymphatic or surgical interventions is not available, consider transfer to a tertiary care centre that can provide multidisciplinary care. IPC placement can be considered as a temporarising measure for symptomatic relief. • In patients with persistent, low-volume non-traumatic chylothorax that is likely to respond to disease-directed treatment, we suggest that interim symptom control with an IPC be considered Remark: The drainage frequency of IPCs in these patients should be ' symptom-guided ' .
