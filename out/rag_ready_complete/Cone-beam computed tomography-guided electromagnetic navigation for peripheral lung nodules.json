    "abstract": "Background: Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) is a minimally invasive technology for the diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary nodules.

Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) could increase diagnostic yield by allowing real-time confirmation to overcome the inherent divergence of nodule location. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic yield of ENB plus CBCT as compared with ENB alone for biopsy of peripheral lung nodules. Method: We conducted a retrospective study of patients undergoing ENB before and after the implementation of CBCT. Data from 62 consecutive patients with lung nodules located in the outer two-thirds of the lung who underwent ENB and combined ENB-CBCT were collected. Radial endobronchial ultrasound was used during all procedures as well. Diagnostic yield was defined as the presence of malignancy or benign histological findings that lead to a specific diagnosis. Results: Thirty-one patients had ENB-CBCT, and 31 patients had only ENB for peripheral lung lesions. The median size of the lesion for the ENB-CBCT group was 16 (interquartile range (IQR) 12.6-25.5) mm as compared to 21.5 (IQR 16-27) mm in the ENB group ( p = 0.2). In the univariate analysis, the diagnostic yield of ENB-CBCT was 74.2% and ENB 51.6% ( p = 0.05). Following multivariate regression analysis adjusting for the size of the lesion, distance from the pleura, and presence of bronchus sign, the odds ratio for the diagnostic yield was 3.4 (95% CI 1.03-11.26, p = 0.04) in the ENB-CBCT group as compared with ENB alone. The median time for the procedure was shorter in patients in the ENB-CBCT group (74 min) than in those in the ENB group (90 min) ( p = 0.02). The rate of adverse events was similar in both groups (6.5%, p = 0.7). Conclusions: The use of CBCT might increase the diagnostic yield in ENB-guided peripheral lung nodule biopsies.

      "title": "Introduction",
      "content": "Diagnostic sampling of suspicious peripheral lung nodules has become increasingly important, as early diagnosis of malignancy can provide an opportunity for potentially curative  resection  and  improved  survival.  Traditionally, computed tomography (CT)-guided transthoracic needle aspiration (TTNA) was the most accepted modality to obtain tissue diagnosis of suspicious peripheral lung nodules, with a diagnostic yield reported in the literature ranging from 77 to 98% [1-4]. However, despite the high diagnostic yield, pneumothorax can occur in up to 35% of patients, with up to 15% requiring chest tube placement, increasing hospital stays and overall health-care costs [5, 6]. This is in contrast to the transbronchial approach, in which the risk of  pneumothorax is only around 0.02-4.9% [7-10]. Furthermore,  CT-guided  TTNA  might  be  associated  with  a higher incidence of local recurrence with pleural dissemination than transbronchial or open lung biopsy [11].\nTransbronchial biopsy is a safe diagnostic tool recommended for patients with peripheral lung nodules, with the limitation of a lower diagnostic yield than CT-guided TTNA.  The  diagnostic  yield  of  transbronchial  biopsy guided by fluoroscopy is widely variable, ranging from 18 to 80%, and is strongly dependent on the lesion size [12, 13]. In order to increase the diagnostic yield of the transbronchial approach, techniques and devices such as the ultrathin bronchoscope, radial endobronchial ultrasonography with guided sheath, electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB), and cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) are becoming widely utilized [11].\nENB allows bronchoscopists to safely navigate to and sample peripheral lung lesions minimally invasively with an acceptable safety profile. Furthermore, the ability to provide concurrent lymph node staging with linear endobronchial ultrasound (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)) or assist in nodule localization via pleural dye or fiducial marking in a single procedure could potentially decrease health-care costs and improve  patient  satisfaction  [10,  14].  However,  due  to CT-to-body divergence and atelectasis, increasing diagnostic yield has been an ongoing challenge.\nRecently, CBCT has emerged as a promising adjunct to navigational bronchoscopy, allowing real-time 'needle in lesion' confirmation, with a potential increase in diagnostic yield [15]. To our knowledge, there has not been a study comparing ENB to ENB along with CBCT confirmation. We aimed to describe our experience of comparing the diagnostic yield of ENB plus CBCT with that of ENB alone in patients with peripheral nodules suspicious for malignancy.",

      "content": "All patients had multi-slice CT scans of the chest done within 4 weeks prior to the procedure, with a slice thickness of 1 mm and an interval of 0.8 mm. The digitized information from each patient's CT scan was imported into the electromagnetic navigation system in which virtual bronchoscopy images were reconstructed. The target anatomic landmarks such as the main carina, right and left upper lobe, middle lobe, and left lower lobe were identified, and thus, radiological mapping was completed. After data processing, all the information was uploaded to the electromagnetic navigation system. iLogic 7.0 ENB  platform (superDimension; Medtronic), the Edge extended working channel catheter (Medtronic, Inc.) with 180- or 90-degree angles, and the standard locatable guide were used in all cases.\nThe CBCT is a high-resolution 2D detector adapted for use with a C-arm. During the procedure, imaging was performed using  an  angiographic  system  (Artis  Zeego;  Siemens  Healthcare, Malvern,  PA,  USA)  equipped  with  a  40  ×  30-cm  detector.  The CBCT imaging protocol used (DynaCT) was characterized by the following parameters: 8 s rotation time, 200° gantry rotation, 0.5°/ projection, 396 total projections, and a detector dose of 0.36 μGy/ frame. Using 3D cross-sectional images, the target was identified (Fig. 2b) and manually contoured on workstation in multiple orthogonal planes using dedicated software (Syngo iGuide Toolbox; Siemens), and then superimposed on live fluoroscopy to provide real-time imaging (Fig. 2c). Two dedicated holders attached to the bronchoscopy were utilized to hold the bronchoscope in position so that the operators could leave the room during CBCT scan as shown in Figure 1.\nAll subjects participating in the study underwent total intravenous anesthesia, neuromuscular paralysis, and mechanical ventilation with volume control (endotracheal tube size 8-9, PEEP between 10 and 20 mmH2O). Continuous telemetry, pulse oximetry, and capnography were used for monitoring patient status during the entire procedure.\nAll the procedures were performed under general anesthesia in a hybrid OR equipped with a C-arm system with CBCT capabilities. Following intubation, a bronchoscope (BF-1T180; Olympus) was introduced into the airway, and then, a curved steerable catheter  (Edge Firm Tip; Medtronic) was inserted into the working\nchannel and navigated to the lesion using the ENB system followed by radial-probe Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) to confirm location. An inspiratory breathhold maneuver with the adjustable pressure-limiting valve set at 20 cm H2O was performed by the anesthesiology provider in both groups. This mimics the inspiratory breath hold done during a CT scan.\nIn the ENB-only group, once successfully navigated to the nodule with ENB and confirmed with radial-probe Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), tissue samples were obtained. In the ENB-only cases, conventional C-arm fluoroscopy was used. In the ENB-CBCT group, once navigated to the lesion using ENB system and confirmed by radial-probe Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), the aspirating needle was inserted. This was followed by the breathhold maneuver with adjustable pressure limiting to perform CBCT to identify the position of the nodule with respect to the fine needle aspiration tip, as shown in Figure 2a. This was followed by manual segmentation on the workstation in multiple orthogonal planes and superimposition of nodule on live fluoroscopy using dedicated software (Syngo iGuide Toolbox; Siemens). Based on needle tip location  on  CBCT  (Fig.  2b),  necessary  adjustments  were  performed under live fluoroscopy. Once satisfied with the location of the needle (Fig. 2c), tissue samples were obtained under live fluoroscopy. Repeat CBCT was performed only if deemed necessary.\nTissue samples were obtained using multimodality tools, including cytology brush, fine needle for aspiration, biopsy forceps, and targeted bronchoalveolar lavage. Furthermore, all patients underwent Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided transbronchial needle aspiration for mediastinal staging following ENB or ENB-CBCT. Rapid on-site pathologic examination was used for all cases. Tissue samples and cytology  specimens  were  eventually  evaluated  by  a  dedicated  lung pathologist.",

      "content": "This retrospective review of 62 patients with peripheral  pulmonary nodules undergoing biopsy with ENBCBCT as compared to ENB demonstrated 22.6% absolute increase in diagnostic yield. To the best of our knowledge, this is a first study comparing ENB-CBCT and ENB alone. The diagnostic yield was conservatively calculated by including only true positives for both malignant and benign diseases, and nonspecific diagnosis was not included. After performing a stepwise regression model adjusting for\nIQR, interquartile range; SD, standard deviation; ENB, electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy; CBCT, cone-beam computed tomography; LLL, left lower lobe; LUL, left upper lobe; RLL, right lower lobe; RUL, right upper lobe.\nENB, electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy; CBCT, cone-beam computed tomography; IQR, interquartile range.\nsize of the target lesion, distance from the pleura, and the presence of bronchus sign, we found an odds ratio for the diagnostic yield of 3.4 (95% CI 1.03-11.26, p = 0.04) in the ENB-CBCT as compared with the ENB group, showing that the results were independent of such factors.\nThis higher diagnostic yield was also despite the fact that  the  median  nodule  size  was  only  16  mm,  nodules were close to the pleura (median distance from the pleura of 8 mm), and the bronchus sign was absent in 42% of patients,  which has previously been described to negatively impact diagnostic yield [16]. In addition, the higher diagnostic yield was achieved even though 41.94% of patients in the ENB-CBCT group had pulmonary nodules in the left upper lobe where such location has been reported to negatively impact the diagnostic yield [16].\nAn unexpected, yet interesting, finding of the study was the median time in minutes for the procedure was shorter in the ENB-CBCT group (74 min) than in ENB only (90 min). Before we start utilizing CBCT for pulmonary nodules, the concern was prolonged procedure, as it requires stabilization of the bronchoscope with a holder, 8 s CBCT scan, segmentation, and projection of nodules on fluoroscopy. We speculate that as navigation became easier  and  more  accurate,  and  required  less  failed  attempts, ultimately it turned out to be an overall time-saving procedure. The median procedure time of 74 min for ENB-CBCT  is  comparable  to  the  reported  procedure time of 79.9 min by Sobieszczyk et al. [16] and 62.5 min by Casal et al. [18].\nThere are 2 main factors we believe why ENB-CBCT demonstrated a higher diagnostic yield than ENB alone. First, CBCT allowed for real-time confirmation. ENB, although real time, is a virtual confirmation of the nodule location which completely depends on the location of the nodule at the time of the CT chest utilized for ENB preplanning. It has been well documented that a lung nodule can diverge from its location due to factors such as lung volumes; full inhalation versus tidal breathing; patient positioning, for example, pillow under head or extended arms; and diaphragm position under positive pressure ventilation and paralytics [17]. ENB inherently will navigate to the deviated location for the same reason. CBCT allowed us real-time confirmation of the nodule location relative to the tip of the sampling device, as shown in Figure 2b, while the patient is intubated, anesthetized, and paralyzed, and allowed us to determine whether the tip of the biopsy tool is already in the nodule and if not, then the exact path to navigate to the nodule with the least possible  divergence.  Second,  as  nodule  was  superimposed on fluoroscopy, the live fluoroscopy allowed us to confirm that the tip of the biopsy instruments was staying in the nodule while taking biopsies, as shown in Figure 2c.\nTable 3 summarizes recently published case series describing  the  utility  of  CBCT  for  peripheral  pulmonary nodules. Sobieszczyk et al. [16] published a retrospective case series of 22 patients with a combination of ENB, REBUS, CBCT, and transbronchial bronchial access tool.\nENB,  electromagnetic  navigational  bronchoscopy;  CBCT,  cone-beam  computed  tomography;  CBCT-AF,  cone-beam  computed  tomography  scan  with  augmented  fluoroscopy;  R-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS),  radial-probe endobronchial ultrasound; TBAT, transbronchial access tool; BAL, bronchoalveolar lavage. a TBAT was used in 7 patients. b Nonspecific inflammation was included in calculation. c Nonspecific inflammation was considered diagnostic if confirmed by surgical pathology or resolved or improved during the follow-up period. d Lung abnormalities with nondefinitive biopsy results that resolved on 6-month follow-up imaging were included in calculations. e Nonspecific inflammation was excluded from calculation.\nThey reported a diagnostic yield of 77.2%, which is comparable to our study; however, authors have not clarified how the yield was calculated. Also, the mean size of pulmonary nodules was 21 mm, which is larger than our median nodule size of 16 mm. Ali et al. [11] reported a prospective case series of 40 patients with a combination of ultrathin bronchoscope, ENB, and CBCT achieving a diagnostic  yield  of  90%,  which  is  higher  than  our  yield. However, the likely explanation for such a high yield is inclusion of nodules with bronchus sign only and inclusion of nonspecific inflammation in diagnostic yield calculation. Casal et al. [18] combined thin/ultrathin bronchoscope, R-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), and CBCT in a prospective series of 20 patients. The median size of the nodules in the series was 21 mm, and the diagnostic yield was 70%. In their series,  nonspecific  inflammation  was  considered  diagnostic if confirmed by surgical pathology or resolved or improved during the follow-up period, which was different from our study as we excluded inflammation from our diagnostic yield calculation. Hofenforst-Schmidt et al. [20] published one of the earliest series on CBCT and peripheral pulmonary nodules. It was a prospective series of  33  patients  divided into subgroups based on nodule size ≤20 and >20 mm. The reported diagnostic yield was 75% in the subgroup of nodules ≤20 mm (mean size 15 mm) and was 67% in the subgroup of nodules >20 mm (mean size 30 mm). Bowling et al. [19] reported a series of 14 patients using a combination of ENB, CBCT-AF, and TBAT, in which they demonstrated a yield of 71% with a median nodule size of 23.7 mm. The authors included nondefinitive biopsy results in yield calculation if the lesion resolved in 6 months. Pritchett et al. [15] published one of the larger retrospective series of 74 patients with 92 nodules combining ENB and CBCT-augmented fluoroscopy. What they described as augmented fluoroscopy is exactly what we described above as nodule superimposed on live fluoroscopy (Fig. 2c). The median lesion size was 16 mm in their series, which was similar to our series; however, their diagnostic yield was 83.7%, which was higher than that in our study by 9.5%. This could be due to their larger sample size.\nAs CBCT is not routinely used in interventional pulmonology yet, it may be difficult to get hospitals invest in CBCT dedicated to bronchoscopy suites. However, CBCT is increasingly used in other specialties such as interventional  radiology,  intervention  cardiology,  vascular  surgery, and neurosurgery. Hence, a cost-effective way would be to collaborate with other specialties in the hospital to have access to CBCT. We collaborated with interventional radiology in our institution.\nOur study has limitations that are inherent to a retrospective study, although this is the first study comparing ENB to ENB-CBCT and demonstrated a positive impact on diagnostic yield using CBCT. Due to the small sample size, wide confidence intervals in our main outcome were expected.  However, we found a statistically significant difference between both groups, reassuring that an actual difference exists and showing a promising approach to  peripheral  lung  lesions  with  a  low  rate  of  adverse events.  Also,  we  used  multimodality  sampling  in  both arms, and such an approach might not be even needed and  could  increase  procedure  costs.  Future  studies should  also  consider  whether  multimodality  sampling techniques are necessary, especially when CBCT is used and the instrument is confirmed to be in the peripheral lung lesion. We did not assess radiation with CBCT and fluoroscopy; however, there are several studies demonstrating that radiation with CBCT and augmented fluoroscopy is within an acceptable range [15, 18-20]. For instance, Casal et al. [18] reported a case series of CBCTguided transbronchial peripheral lung nodule biopsies with the primary objective of estimating radiation dose. They demonstrated the mean estimated effective radiation dose to patients resulting from CBCT and fluoroscopy combined ranged between 11 and 29 mSv, depending on utilized conversion factors [18], which is comparable  to  average  radiation  from  CT-guided  diagnostic and therapeutic procedures of chest and abdomen [21, 22]. The radiation will vary based on factors like number and  duration  of  CBCT  acquisition,  length  of  the  field covered, manufacturer, and duration of fluoroscopy [15, 18, 23]. Steinfort et al. [23] demonstrated reduction in radiation dose by reducing imaging interval and inferosuperior field dimensions. Finally, CBCT is only available  for  proceduralists  in  a  handful  of  expert  centers, making the likelihood of widespread use of such combined procedures low.",

      "content": "The use of intraprocedural CBCT in conjunction with ENB may significantly increase diagnostic yield for peripheral pulmonary nodules by providing real-time confirmation of various lung biopsy tools. The safety profile is  similar  to  other  peripheral  bronchoscopy  platforms and better than the percutaneous lung biopsy approach. The above findings need to be confirmed in multicenter prospective trials.",
