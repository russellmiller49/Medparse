The purposes of this study were to evaluate the utility of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography in differentiating malignant and benign mediastinal lymph nodes (LNs) and to explore the factors that influence its accuracy.\nMethods: A retrospective chart review of patients who underwent Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA from October 2016 to July 2017 was performed. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) with conventional B-mode features and elastographic patterns were compared with the final pathology results or clinical follow-up. We used the following Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastographic patterns for classification: type 1, predominantly non-blue (green, yellow and red); type 2, part blue, part non-blue; type 3, predominantly blue. The potential impacts of the characteristics of LNs, the underlying lung diseases and obtaining fibrotic components from Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA specimens were evaluated relative to the accuracy of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography.\nResults: A total of 206 LNs from 94 patients were retrospectively evaluated. In classifying type 1 as 'benign' and type 3 as 'malignant,' the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and diagnostic accuracy rate were 90.6, 82.6, 71.6, 94.7 and 85.2%, respectively. The Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastographic patterns had higher diagnostic yields and negative predictive values than conventional B-mode features. Logistic regression analysis revealed that central necrosis was a factor that influenced the accuracy of elastography in malignant LNs. The fibrotic component within benign LNs could cause an incorrect elastographic pattern.\nE-mail address: ccho1203@ntu.edu.tw (C.-C. Ho).\n0929-6646/Copyright ª 2018, Formosan Medical Association.

      "content": "Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA) is a relatively new and minimally invasive procedure for approaching mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes (LNs). Prior studies have confirmed its high diagnostic yield in most mediastinal malignancies and in some benign inflammatory processes. 1 e 3 Some studies verified that using Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA as the initial investigating tool could shorten the duration of diagnosis and staging in non-small cell lung cancer patients. 4,5 As a result, EBUSTBNA has become the first-choice diagnostic and staging tool for mediastinal lesions in most clinical institutions.\nDuring Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) procedures, we often found several possible targets in the same station. How the target lesion for aspiration/biopsy is chosen may determine the diagnostic yield of the procedure. Elastography is a new ultrasonography (US) associated technique that generates objective strain images of tissue compressibility. This method is used to detect the stiffness of tissue and could be used to distinguish benign from malignant components. The effectiveness of elastography in breast, thyroid, liver or even endoscopic US is well established. 7 e 10 There is a limited amount of data on the use of elastography in Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) procedures. 11,12 Our aims in this study were to evaluate the utility of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA and to investigate possible factors that might influence the accuracy of elastographic patterns.",

Scanning was done on a 7.5 MHz frequency US, and images were generated using a new dedicated US processor (EUME2 PREMIER PLUS, Olympus).\nAfter detecting the target LNs, the following Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) Bmode sonographic features, based on the previous report by Fujiwara, were recorded 14 : (1) length of the short axis, (2) shape, (3) margin, (4) echogenicity, (5) central hilar structure (CHS), and (6) coagulation necrosis sign (CNS). Round shape was defined as LNs with a ratio of the short to long axis of less than 1.5. Distinct margin was defined as the majority margin ( > 50%) of LN that could be clearly visualized. Heterogeneous echogenicity was considered nonuniform within the LN. CHS was a linear, flat, hyperechoic area detected within the LN. CNS indicated a hypoechoic area within the LN without blood flow. All conventional US B-mode characteristics were interpreted by at least 2 of the experienced pulmonary physicians (CKL, KLY, LYC, HJF) during the procedure.",

Elastographic images were generated by the pressure that was produced from the pulsation of great vessels within the mediastinum.

The colors associated with hard, intermediate, and soft tissues were blue, green, and yellow/red, respectively. The classification of elastographic patterns followed the system of Izumo, and was based on the dominant colors and their distribution within the target LNs: 11\nWe used the elastographic evaluation to guide the EBUSTBNA procedure. The dominant blue area within the target LNs would first be selected for puncture. The rapid on-site cytology exam was not performed for all of our patients due to the lack of availability in our institution.

      "content": "The diagnosis of benign or malignant processes based on each ultrasonic feature is shown in Fig. 2. In the B-mode sonographic features, LNs with a short axis S 1 cm, round shape, distinct margin, heterogeneous echogenicity, absence of CHS, and presence of CNS were defined as malignant. As for the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastographic patterns, we defined type 3 as a malignancy and type 1 as a benign process. True positive was defined as a LN with 'malignant' sonographic features that were proved to be malignant in the final diagnosis. If the LN with 'benign' sonographic features was confirmed to be a benign process, we considered it a true negative. False positive was a benign LN with 'malignant' sonographic features. False negative meant that a 'benign' sonographic feature could be found in malignant LNs. Each sonographic feature (conventional B-mode and elastography) was analyzed separately.\nTable 3 shows the diagnostic test evaluation of elastography and conventional B-mode sonographic features for predicting malignant LNs after excluding type 2 elastographic lesions (44 LNs). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and diagnostic\naccuracy rates of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography were 90.6, 82.6, 71.6, 94.7 and 85.2%, respectively. These 162 LNs revealed that the elastographic patterns had higher diagnostic yields and negative predictive values than other conventional B-mode features. The positive predictive value was a little lower for elastographic patterns than CNS, but sensitivity was significantly higher. The distribution of B-mode sonographic features was no different between the 206 LNs in this study and study groups without type 2 elastographic lesions (Table S1). When all the LNs were enrolled in the present study, the diagnostic test parameters for conventional Bmode sonographic features in all study groups (206 LNs) showed very similar results, compared to the study groups without type 2 elastographic lesions (Table S2).\nLogistic regression analysis revealed that elastography, margin and echogenicity were independent predictive factors for malignant LNs (Table 3). By combining elastography and these 2 conventional B-mode sonographic features (margin and echogenicity), higher positive predictive value would be obtained if more positive sonographic features coexisted with the positive elastographic pattern. When all image patterns showed positive results in a LN simultaneously, the positive predictive value was up to 92.6. There was no significant improvement in the diagnostic accuracy of predicting malignancy.",

The fibrotic component within benign LNs and malignant LNs with central necrosis could influence the accuracy of elastographic evaluations.\nIdentification of the proper LN or target site at which malignancy is most likely may sometimes be challenging. Several reports showed that the conventional B-mode and vascular Doppler image pattern produced by Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) could provide good information for differentiating metastatic LNs\nNon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) Z Non-small cell lung cancer.\nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA Z endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration; LN Z lymph node.\nin lung cancer patients. 14 e 16 The accuracy depends on the operator's familiarity with the image patterns. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography offers a new modality to differentiate benign from malignant. Neoplastic tissue containing greater cellularity and vascularity, which cause a stiffer texture, compares to normal tissue. 6 In other words, stiffer lesions are more likely to be a malignant process. Previous studies have shown that in classifying the type 1 elastographic pattern as 'benign' and type 3 as 'malignant,' the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and diagnostic yield were excellent. 11,17 Using the same criteria in the present study, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and diagnostic yield were 90.6, 82.6, 71.6, 94.7 and 85.2%, respectively. Their utility in detecting malignancy was therefore substantiated.\nFewstudieshavecomparedtheabilityofEBUSelastography and conventional B-mode imaging to differentiate a malignant\nprocess. He et al. reported that the elastography grading score had higher sensitivity and specificity than conventional Bmode criteria in diagnosing malignant lung lesions. 18,19 In the present study, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastographic patterns had a better diagnostic yield than all the conventional sonographic features. Though CNS had a higher specificity and positive predict value, the sensitivity was extremely low (13.2%). Therefore, we thought this should not be a suitable parameter for guiding Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA.Combiningelastography and specific conventional B-mode sonographic features (echogenicity and margin) improved the positive predictive value in the present study (Table 3). If these 3 image patterns existed in one LN, a higher possibility of malignancy would be suspected. However, the diagnostic yield did not increase significantly. Using elastography alone to predict malignancy was still valid. Otherwise, the distribution of all conventional sonographic features was very similar between the study groups and those without type 2\nCHS Z central hilar structure; CNS Z coagulation necrosis sign; LN Z lymph node; NPV Z negative predictive value; PPV Z positive predictive value; * Z statistical significance with p-value < 0.05.\nelastographic patterns. We supposed the result could be extended to the entire study population.\nThis was the first study to verify possible factors that might influence the accuracy of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography. Previous reports considered that fibrous tissue hyperplasia within the benign process might cause greater stiffness. Malignant lesions with central necrosis could become softer as a result. 17,20 These situations might confuse the results of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography. In thepresent study, malignant LNs with central necrosis tended to have a softer elastographic pattern (type 2 or type 1). If Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA revealed a fibrotic component in benign LN, a harder elastographic pattern (type 2 or type 3) would be expressedmoreeasily.Theseresultscorrespondedtothoseof previous studies. Though our pathologic reports were not controlled with surgical biopsy, we punctured the dominant blue area under the guidance of elastographic evaluation. We supposed that the harder elastographic pattern within the target LN was caused by fibrotic tissue.\nSeveral reports have mentioned that blue elastographic imaging frequently exists in calcified LNs. 17,20 To our knowledge, calcification frequently is detected within the mediastinal LNs due to pneumoconiosis. However, we did not find statistically significant differences in the present study. We thought the reason for this might be the small sample sizes in our study group. CT imaging detected calcification in only 7 LNs, and 3 patients with 9 LNs had underlying pneumoconiosis. The type 3 elastographic pattern was found in a larger proportion of calcified LNs (4/ 7, 57%) and in those with pneumoconiosis (5/9, 55.6%). We believe that elastography is still a good method for accessing the internal structure of the observed lesions.\nRozman et al. thought that the elastographic image for right paratracheal LNs might be influenced by the less heart and vascular pulsations transmitted to the right side of the trachea. 20 In the present study, the diagnostic yield did not differ between right-side and non-right-side LNs. Some researchers also thought that respiratory movement might provide the compressive action need to assist the elastographic image. 19 Different lung conditions have different lung elasticity, thereby producing various compressive effects on the target lesions. In the final result of our study,\nemphysematous lung or fibrotic lung caused by pneumoconiosis would not affect the accuracy of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography. We thought that the conditions just mentioned above need no cautious interpretation when judging the results of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography.\nIn the present study, we used a qualitative method with a 3-type classification of elastographic patterns for assessing the compressibility of the target lesion. The elastography strain ratio, a quantitative method, has also been used. 20,21 Previous studies have demonstrated the great accuracy of elastography strain ratio in distinguishing malignant from benign mediastinal LNs. However, this method seems more complex, and may require more time to analyze the results. One study found that qualitative and quantitative Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography had similar diagnostic performances. 21 However, we consider that qualitative Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography may be more suitable for clinical practice.\nOur study had some limitations. First, this was a retrospective study. A prospective study is warranted to confirm the utility of elastography in distinguishing malignant LNs. Second, the elastographic images were determined from 'frozen' Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) images, so selection bias might have appeared during static image selection. Third, we did not use a surgical criteria standard in defining the pathologies of all study groups, even though all the benign processes were clinically followed for at least 6 months and characterized via chest CT. Finally, we did not change the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA needle when puncturing different LNs. This might be a risk factor leading to false positive cytologic results. The specimen might be contaminated if the previous LNs were malignant. We reviewedall of the malignant LNs in the present study, and all of them were diagnosed by the pathologic result. Contamination of the pathologic specimen might be more difficult in this situation. Therefore, we believe the results of the present study can be applied in clinical practice.",
