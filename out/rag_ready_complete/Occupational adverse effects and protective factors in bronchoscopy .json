However, the occupational adverse effects experienced by healthcare workers in interventional pulmonology should receive increasing attention. Various aspects of adverse effects in bronchoscopy are often neglected, and healthcare workers frequently ignore guidelines for personal protection against factors such as radiation, smoke, pathogenic microbiological aerosols, cryogenic gas, etc. Thus, there is an urgent need to conduct additional research to establish standards for occupational adverse effects and protective measures related to bronchoscopy.\nKeywords: Bronchoscopy; occupational exposure; protective factors; health personnel\nSubmitted Oct 31, 2018.

Non-stochastic effects include erythema, skin peeling, myelosuppression, organ atrophy, cataracts, and infertility. The severity of nonstochastic effects varies with changes in the radiation dose, and a dose threshold exists. The 2007 'Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection' (ICRP) proposed that occupational radiation exposure should be limited to ≤ 20 mSv/year (2). The stochastic effects include carcinogenic and genetic effects, and the probability of occurrence (but not the severity) is related to the dose level. Zielinski et al. (3) conducted a long-term follow-up study of 67,562 medical workers who had been exposed to chronic low-dose ionizing radiation between 1951 and 1987. They observed 1,309 cases of cancer. The mean annual exposure among cancer patients between 1951 and 1970 was 1.14 mSv/year, and between 1971 and 1987, it was 0.36 mSv/year. The incidence of thyroid cancer was significantly elevated, and the incidence of liver cancer was significantly elevated among females, which implies that low-dose ionizing radiation increases the incidence of cancer.",

      "content": "Peripheral transbronchial biopsy is a primary method used to biopsy peripheral lung tissues for the diagnosis of lung cancer. X-ray imaging techniques can be used to  aid  certain  flexible  bronchoscopy procedures. For example, the application of X-ray-guided localization in the biopsy of peripheral lung lesions can significantly enhance the rate of positive diagnosis. However, it also exposes healthcare workers to X-rays. Steinfort et al. (4) calculated the radiation dose received by patients and healthcare workers during 45 ultrasound bronchoscopies with fluoroscopic guidance. Their results showed that for each session of ultrasound bronchoscopy with fluoroscopic guidance (median fluoroscopic screening time: 96±55 s), the patient received a median radiation dose of 0.49±0.37 mSv. The effective radiation dose received through protective garments was attenuated to 0.4 µSv for the operator and 0.2 µSv for the assistant. Katsurada et al. (5) calculated the radiation dose received by healthcare workers over 132 cases of endobronchial ultrasonography with a guide sheath under X-ray guidance (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-GS). The results showed that in a procedure with a median radiation time of 7.6 min, the operator received a median radiation dose of 12 µSv. Changes in the patient's body mass index and the location of the R-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) probe resulted in a relative increase in the\nradiation dose received by healthcare workers. The study data indicated that, although healthcare workers are only exposed to small doses of radiation during bronchoscopy procedures under X-ray guidance, radiation safety precautions should not be neglected.\nCT and CT fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous lung biopsy are currently the most commonly used imagingguided methods of percutaneous lung biopsy. Compared to traditional CT guidance, CT fluoroscopy provides realtime guidance, which reduces the procedure time and the number of punctures. It also decreases the duration of the patient's exposure to X-rays and enables access to smaller lesions and to lesions in suboptimal locations. However, it  increases the radiation exposure of the operator. Buls et al. (6) recorded the radiation dose received by patients and healthcare workers during 82 procedures performed under CT fluoroscopy guidance. Among 46 patients who underwent a biopsy, the median entrance skin dose was 380 mSv; for 18 cases of breast tissue biopsy, the median entrance skin dose of the healthcare workers was 0.174 mSv. All healthcare workers wore protective lead garments providing protection of 0.50-mm lead equivalents at the front and 0.25 lead equivalents at the sides and back.\nRadiation-related  protective  measures  during bronchoscopy procedures under X-ray guidance should follow the principles of protection for general occupational radiation exposure. These principles are as follows: (I)  as  time  protection, the operator should master the interventional surgical procedures to reduce the duration of radiation exposure; (II) as distance protection, the operator should maintain a certain distance from the patient and should place the X-ray image intensifier as close to the patient as possible. Personnel should also maintain an appropriate distance, standing a far from the operating table as possible; (III) as personal protection, X-ray protective equipment, such as lead clothing, glasses, and collars with a 0.50-mm lead equivalence, should be worn (6); (IV) healthcare workers should receive training related to radiation protection, and protection awareness should be increased; (V) bronchoscopy procedures and CT rooms should be carefully managed, and the relevant medical devices should be maintained (1).",

      "content": "Chemotherapy is a crucial treatment method for most lung cancer patients who cannot be treated surgically. Radioactive\nparticle implantation also has several advantages: it is minimally invasive, offers accurate target irradiation, and does not increase lung tissue damage. Implantation methods include CT-guided radioactive particle implantation and high dose rate endobronchial brachytherapy. Currently, 125 I and 192 Ir are the most commonly used radioactive particles. 125 I releases γ -rays, and 192 Ir releases β - and γ -rays. Zhuo et  al. (7) performed CT-guided 125 I  implantation in 20 patients with malignant tumors and monitored the radiation dose. The 125 I source intensity was 2.2×10 7 -3.3×10 7 Bq, and an average of 19.65 particles were implanted per patient. The radiation dose was measured immediately after and 2, 4, and 6 months after surgery, and those values were compared to the natural background radiation dose. The results showed that the radiation dose decreased rapidly with increasing distance; at a distance of 50 cm, the detected dose was similar to the natural background radiation dose (10.2-10.8 µSv/h). The mean radiation dose detected immediately after surgery was 60.38±31.92 µSv/h at the body surface and 10.64±0.51 µSv/h at 50 cm; the mean radiation dose detected at the body surface after 6 months was 12.31±4.05 µSv/h. Hence, the radiation dose attenuated with time, and the dose detected at the body surface after 6 months was close to the natural background dose.\nThe following protective measures should be in place for healthcare workers performing radioactive particle implantation procedures (7). (I) Rational treatment plans should be formulated according to the principles of standardization and optimization, including particle selection, implantation methods, number of particles, gross activity, and simulation dose and its distribution. (II) Lead clothing including a hat, collar, gloves, glasses, and other radiation protection tools and a lead equivalence of 0.18-0.25 mm should be worn. The surgeon should also wear protective glasses and leaded gloves, and longhandled tweezers should be used to retrieve the radioactive particles. (III) Waste particles should be considered and disposed of in radioactive waste bins. After surgery, a γ -ray detector should be used to carefully determine whether any particles remain on the work surfaces or the ground. (IV) Personal dosimeters to monitor the accepted level of lowenergy radiation should be prepared and used appropriately. (V) Surgeons should be proficient in the procedures, as proficiency reduces the contact time with the radioactive source.\nThe following post-operative precautions are necessary (7). (I) No special protective measures are necessary for general post-operative care. When providing care at close range\n(<50 cm), patients should be covered with a rubber sheet or wear leaded clothing with a lead equivalence of 0.18-0.25 mm. (II) No special protective measures are necessary after discharge. A distance of 1 m should be maintained from family members, and no protection is needed after 6 months. (III) Regular post-operative followups are needed to detect any displacement of particles. Effective measures should be implemented in patients prone to displacement to prevent the loss of particles.",

However, the use of such thermal ablation technology results in the incomplete combustion of proteins, fats, and other components of human tissues, which produces visible smoke. Not only does this smoke have a strange odor and obstruct the endoscopic field of view, it also releases toxic chemical compounds into the ambient air (8).",

      "title": "Smoke production and hazards",
      "content": "Laser treatment under bronchoscopy primarily depends on the thermal effects of the laser; light energy is converted to thermal energy and produces a series of tissue changes. It  causes  the  coagulation,  vaporization  (100 ℃ ),  or carbonization (210 ℃ )  of  the  irradiated tissues, thereby achieving ablation of lesions. When the temperature reaches 100 ℃ ,  water within tissue boils and begins to vaporize and produce smoke (9). The high-frequency electric knife uses the thermal effects generated by passing a highfrequency electric current through the tissue, which causes the explosive vaporization of tissues under the electrode. This results in the formation of flat, narrow, non-bleeding incisions a few millimeters deep. Different thermal effects can be generated using the electric knife by controlling the electric current. The argon plasma coagulation uses high-frequency and high-voltage ionization of argon gas into argon ions, which allows continuous conduction of an electric current.\nResearch has determined that surgical smoke contains 95% steam; the remaining 5% is chemical compounds and\ntissue debris, which may be hazardous to human health. The smoke produced from laser treatments contains particles with an average diameter of 0.3 µm, whereas electrocautery smoke can contain particles with an average diameter of <0.1 µm (10). It was recently determined that electrocautery and argon plasma coagulation induced the production of a high concentration (>100,000 cm -3 )  of particles ranging from 10 nm to 1 µm in diameter. These can be directly inhaled by healthcare workers and invade the alveoli, which may be hazardous to human health (11).\nSmoke primarily contains toxic and hazardous chemical compounds, invisible particles, viable pathogens and viruses, and viable cancerous cells (12).",

Overexposure to CO causes headaches, nausea, emesis, and heart arrhythmia, and may further damage cardiovascular function in patients with cardiovascular disease (14). Acrylonitrile is a colorless volatile liquid with a pungent odor. It is highly toxic and can easily be absorbed by the skin and lungs. Animal studies have shown that repeated or long-term exposure to acrylonitrile can cause mucosal inflammation, cancer, and other health problems (13). Exposure to benzene can trigger nausea and headaches, while long-term exposure can result in hematopoietic disorders, which may cause anemia or even lymphomas (10).",

The NIOSH also recommends that smoke capturing devices should be placed within 5 cm of the surgical field during the production of surgical smoke (17). A special smoke evacuator should be used during laser irradiation, and the tip of the smoke evacuator should be placed within 5 cm of the laser irradiation area (17). Electrosurgical knives with smoke capturing devices or evacuators have recently been put into use. In China, smoke extraction devices are still not used in all bronchoscopy rooms, and the relevant protective measures are insufficient. Most smoke generated during procedures is aspirated using negative-pressure suction devices. There are currently no studies of the protective measures used in bronchoscopy rooms, but comparisons can be made to surgical smoke extraction devices.

      "title": "Hazards of medical lasers experienced by healthcare workers",
      "content": "There are many types of medical lasers; those used for the treatment of airway lesions include neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) lasers, CO 2 lasers, and holmium lasers. Among them, the Nd:YAG laser possesses strong ablative abilities and can be used for cutting, burning, vaporizing, and deep coagulation. It is currently the most commonly used laser technology in respiratory medicine. Based on the risks to the operator, laser safety can be divided into four classes. The classification of the laser is based on the length of the maximum permissible emission (MPE) compared to the human aversion response. The MPE determines how long an unprotected eye can be exposed to a laser beam before injury occurs.\nMedical lasers are Class 3B or Class 4 lasers (18), and Class 4 lasers have sufficient power to cause instantaneous eye or skin injury in humans. The diffuse reflection of such lasers is also very harmful to the eyes and skin (18).\nMost of the reported laser eye accidents involve at least some carelessness, such as not wearing eye protection, and could have been avoided by following standard laser safety practices. In addition to looking directly at the laser source, reflection of the beam by a mirror or nearby object occasionally causes such accidents. The victim usually experiences a sudden and severe disturbance of vision in one eye preceded by a visible flash of bright colored light and an audible pop without pain. The subsequent clinical course can be characterized by marked improvement during a period of a few days to weeks, mainly due to clearing of hemorrhage and subsidence of inflammation at the site of injury (19). Shum et  al. (20)  reported the case of a 31-year-old beauty parlor aesthetician who was operating an Nd:YAG cosmetic laser machine of 1,064 nm wavelength with the probe held in the opposite direction when on firing, the laser shot fired into her left eye. The patient heard a 'pop' sound and immediately saw floaters and experienced blurring of vision. Optical coherence tomography taken over the injured area during a 6-week follow-up showed thickened retina and preretinal hyperreflectivities.  Humphrey's visual field showed a dense scotoma emanating from the blind spot. Eventually, scarring occurred at the lesion site, and the patient's vision recovered.\nIn bronchoscopy rooms, the primary hazard of medical lasers is ocular injury caused by reflected laser beams. The wavelength of Nd:YAG lasers is 1.06 µm, and a power of <40 W is commonly used, which causes retinal and choroid damage in humans. Virtually all reported laser injuries have involved the retina and were caused by relatively low-power, pulsed Nd:YAG lasers.",

The interactive effects of multiple conditions can cause a continuous decline in the viability of microorganisms within microbiological aerosols. The air is not a suitable temporary habitat for the microorganisms within the aerosols, and they will not be transmitted over long distances. However, once a certain concentration and diameter are reached and suitable airflow conditions are in place for delivery to susceptible groups, the risk of infection increases greatly for healthcare workers who have close contact with the patient (23).\nStudies outside of China have reported that the transmission of highly infectious diseases from patients to healthcare workers is uncommon. However, several cases of Streptococcus pyogenes , Neisseria meningitides , Haemophilus influenzae ,  and Acinetobacter baumannii transmission to healthcare workers through occupational exposure have been reported (24). Furthermore, healthcare workers account for approximately 20% of cases of acquired severe acute respiratory syndrome worldwide. Due to the exposure to certain airborne pathogens, many medical procedures also increase the risk of occupational exposure to infection of healthcare workers (25,26).\nMarchand et  al. (25)  collected  air  samples  during bronchoscopic procedures from two bronchoscopy rooms in two hospitals. The sampling range was within a 1.5-m radius of the patient's mouth and the surgeon's breathing zone. The results showed that during the waiting and preparation stages for a bronchoscopy, the culturable bacterial concentrations of air samples were higher than\nthe background concentrations collected at the end of the procedure. All samples included at least one Staphylococcus species. Although most of the culturable bacteria were normal non-pathogenic species of Streptococcus , Neisseria , and Corynebacterium ,  certain  opportunistic pathogens were also found, including Streptococcus pneumoniae .  The study did not detect any Mycobacterium or  influenza viruses.\nThe transmission of tuberculosis (TB) from TB patients to healthcare workers during bronchoscopy is a recognized occupational risk (27). Calculations by Catanzaro (28) showed that more than 200 units per hour of aerosolized infectious mycobacteria are released during intubation and bronchoscopy. Intubation under bronchoscopy simulates the patient's cough reflex, which produces particles of various sizes that can remain viable for hours in the air. Large particles shrink due to evaporation and become small particles, which can remain airborne for longer periods of time. These particles are composed of saliva, mucus, and microbes; most are 0.1-10 µm in size and can be inhaled into the lungs. If the pathogen-laden particles are inhaled and deposited into the respiratory tract, they may cause a respiratory infection (25).\nIn  addition,  surgeons who do not wear protective goggles may be at risk of HIV infection when performing bronchoscopy on patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, as HIV may be transmitted via the conjunctiva. There are currently no studies reporting the transmission of HIV infection to healthcare workers during bronchoscopy procedures. However, the risk of infection is believed to be higher in healthcare workers performing bronchoscopy in patients with an unknown HIV status.",

Hence, thorough disinfection and sterilization are difficult. During the cleaning and disinfection of respiratory endoscopes, in addition to thorough cleaning and disinfection to prevent cross-\ncontamination, emphasis should be placed on the hazards that cleaning and disinfection staff are exposed to due to the volatilization and spraying of the chemical compounds used for cleaning and disinfection. The volatilization and spraying of high-level disinfectants such as orthophthalaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, and peracetic acid, as well as sterilants such as glutaraldehyde and peracetic acid used during disinfection, are hazardous to the respiratory system, skin, and conjunctiva of the endoscope cleaning and disinfection staff (34).",

Currently, there have been no reports of deaths or cancer cases, and no in vivo or in  vitro studies suggesting the presence of genetic and reproductive toxicity (35). Vyas et al. (36) conducted a survey of 348 current endoscopy nurses and 18 former nurses who left their jobs for health reasons. Among them, 91.4% were primarily exposed to glutaraldehyde. The survey found that the mean force expired volume in 1 second of the former nurses was 93.82% [95% confidence interval (CI): 88.53-99.11%], which was significantly lower than that of the current nurses exposed to glutaraldehyde (104.08%; 95% CI: 102.35-105.73%).

      "content": "Endoluminal cryotherapy with bronchoscopy is a transbronchial bronchoscopic intervention that introduces CO2, N2O, and other cryogenic gases via a cryoprobe to\ntreat airway stenosis, hemorrhage, and other lesions. The cryogenic source is a component of the cryotherapy device. Commonly used cryogens include CO2 and N2O due to their low cost, with CO 2 being most widely used. Cryogens use the low temperatures generated due to continuous heat absorption during vaporization to achieve the effects of cryotherapy. Cryogens absorb heat and are ultimately vaporized into CO 2 and N2 O gases, which can easily diffuse within the operating theater and cause waste gas pollution, resulting in certain hazards to healthcare workers if inhaled.\nN2O is a colorless gas with a sweet odor that is stable at  room temperature and has mild anesthetic effects. It  is  commonly used to induce anesthesia in surgeries. The exposure limit to N2O as a waste anesthetic gas recommended by NIOSH is 25 ppm (46 mg/m 3 ) (37). N2O primarily produces its effects via inhalation. At high concentrations, N2O causes asphyxiation; at low concentrations, it affects the central nervous system, cardiovascular system, liver, hematopoietic system, and reproductive system (38). An N 2 O concentration of 50-67% (500,000-670,000 ppm) is used to induce anesthesia. Studies of dentists and assistants have reported that long-term occupational exposure to N 2 O can result in limb numbness, difficulty concentrating, abnormal sensations, and impaired balance (38).\nAlthough there are currently no studies related to the measurement and investigation of cryogen waste gases produced during bronchoscopic cryotherapy, it is still necessary to implement protective measures to reduce the occupational exposure to N 2 O, such as the installation of waste gas evacuators, use of diluters, and use of personal protection. Currently, bronchoscopy rooms are usually connected to evacuators that dispose of cryogen waste gases, thereby reducing their indoor concentrations. However, the effects on outdoor air pollution and the risks to the outdoor population require further investigation. CO 2 , which is less costly and safer, may be used to avoid occupational N 2O exposure.",

The rapid development of these techniques and the achievement of good results are accompanied by the increasing issues of occupational exposure and hazards experienced by healthcare workers. This review analyzed the occupational exposure of healthcare workers\nin interventional pulmonology to radiation exposure, smoke pollution, laser radiation, pathogenic aerosols, disinfectants, and cryogenic gases, and discussed the related protective measures.\nIn China, the occupational exposure and protection of healthcare workers in interventional pulmonology has been neglected. Although certain expert consensus and guidelines for occupational exposure have been established and related studies have been conducted, there is still a lack of emphasis on this topic. This topic urgently requires the continued collaboration of healthcare workers in interventional pulmonology, with reference to interventional medicine in other disciplines, to conduct additional research to establish standards for occupational exposure, hazards, and protection in interventional pulmonology.",
