      "title": "1. Introduction",
      "content": "In 2020, lung cancer was expected to be one of the top three cancers for both men and women in the US [1]. A total of 228,820 new cases of lung cancer were diagnosed\n(116,300 in men and 112,520 in women), and approximately 135,720 deaths from lung cancer occurred (72,500 in men and 63,220 in women) in the year 2020 [1]. Lung cancer is generally classified as small-cell or non-small cell lung cancer (Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)), with the latter being more frequent. Patients with Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tend to be older and therefore experience several comorbidities [2]. Severity of Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has resulted in the development of multiple treatment options, both therapeutic and palliative. Lung cancer screening using low-dose CT scan imaging has demonstrated improved survival, as many screens detect relatively early stage of disease, with a high potential for cure.\nAlthough surgical resection offers a strong opportunity for cure in early stage Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases, the presence of comorbid conditions can deem a patient to be medically inoperable. One option for these patients is radiosurgery, which is the precise delivery of radiation therapy to a limited tumor volume [3,4]. Additionally, other types of ablation therapies, such as photodynamic therapy (PDT), are promising. Used alone or as part of multi-modal therapy, PDT can help decrease the probability of disease progression and/or mortality in Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who present with high-risk localized disease, as well as for locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic disease [5-9].\nLate-stage disease mostly renders patients unsuitable to receive curative surgery, largely due to extent of disease. Treatments, such as radiation therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and ablation therapies, such as PDT, cryotherapy, argon plasma coagulation and ND:YAG laser, either alone or in combination, have demonstrated improved outcomes [5-11]. Among Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, many types of ablation therapies, either as monotherapy or as part of the multimodal treatment approach, have shown favorable results, irrespective of the intent of treatment (curative or palliative).\nPDT is an FDA-approved treatment and has a long history of clinical success in treating lung cancer. It involves systemic administration of the light-sensitive drug (i.e., photosensitizer), Photofrin ® , which then preferentially accumulates in the target tissue and is cleared from surrounding normal tissues. After 48 h, target tissue is illuminated with laser light at a red wavelength of 630 nm, which activates Photofrin to generate toxic reactive oxygen species, notably singlet oxygen [6], and thus leading to tumor destruction. The process via which tumor is destructed is a combination of direct cellular and secondary vascular effects [7]. In addition to local tumor ablation, PDT can improve antitumor immunity as shown in pre-clinical and clinical settings. For Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), PDT has been used historically as monotherapy or as combination therapy along with surgery, chemotherapy, or standard radiation therapy [5,12-17].\nFor early and advanced stage Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), PDT has been approved for symptom management, curative and palliative intent, especially in cases with tumors that are ineligible for standard surgery and radiation therapy. Overall, severe toxicities are uncommon in PDT and it is well tolerated [5,12,16,17]. At the same time, in spite of its potential to be a promising treatment option, PDT remains underutilized mostly due to the lack of randomized trials comparing PDT and conventional therapies.\nSystemic therapy is viewed as the cornerstone of disease treatment in Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with stage III or IV disease [4,18]. A randomized, prospective study among patients with oligometastatic Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) observed improved progression-free survival with local therapy (surgery or radiation), compared to systemic therapy alone [19]. However, PDT can be an option both for palliation and survival enhancement for many of these patients with symptomatic progression to airway compromise. Additionally, several of these patients may either not be candidates for or consent for chemotherapy. Radiation therapy alone may be employed in these cases, although it may not offer substantial rates or prolonged ability to generate disease control. This may be due to widespread disease or lack of ability to achieve ablative dose of radiation due to bulk of disease. In situations such as these, PDT may also offer enhanced and prolonged palliation to patients with airway obstruction. However, we know very little about how PDT can be incorporated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Therefore, in this study, we assess the association between PDT along with radiation and chemotherapy with radiation alone as reference\ngroup, among Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with stage III or stage IV disease. Our hypothesis is that after adjusting for covariates, PDT demonstrates a survival benefit among patients with stage III or stage IV of Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).",

In general, the better outcomes associated with PDT may be due to local control that is more sustained. Alternately, similar to radiation therapy, this may be due to abscopal effect as a result of the immunogenic properties induced by PDT [22].

In a study of NCDB data of patients with stage IV Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), surgical resection plus systemic therapy or EBRT/thermal ablation plus systemic therapy was shown to be beneficial compared to systemic therapy alone [27]. Among the selected patients with limited metastases, benefits of local therapy in conjunction with systemic therapy have been observed [28]. Studies in patients with oligometastatic Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have shown the benefit of local consolidative therapy (surgical resection or chemo/radiotherapy) [19,29].\nResults of a SEER-Medicare analysis showed that for stage III Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), intensity modulated radiation therapy was associated with similar overall and cancer-specific survival and maintained similar toxicity risks compared with 3D-CRT [30]. Elderly patients with advanced Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) showed improved survival outcomes with use of chemotherapy [31]. In addition, for advanced Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improved survival [32]. Multimodal therapy of systemic and local therapy (radiation or surgery) showed improved survival [3,33-35]. However, many patients diagnosed with Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are elderly have medical comorbidities, poor functional status or notable preexisting weight loss and may not be able to tolerate chemotherapy with radiation. Patients who refuse or are not candidates for chemotherapy or surgery often receive radiation therapy alone. Arecent NCDB study showed that hypofractionated radiation therapy is a viable option for locally advanced Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [36]. Given the heterogeneity of the Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), many systemic and local therapy options are available. However, optimal management for patients with T3 and T4 Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unclear.\nAn earlier randomized controlled study compared the safety and efficacy of PDT plus external beam radiation vs. external beam radiation alone among 41 patients with inoperable non-small cell bronchogenic carcinoma obstructing a central airway. It was noted that, compared to radiation alone, the addition of PDT prior to radiation therapy resulted in significantly favorable and longer lasting local control of the disease [11]. In another study, the safety and effectiveness of combined brachytherapy and PDT were evaluated in patients with bulky endobronchial lung cancer. Of the 32 patients in the study, 15 were technically inoperable and 17 had recurrent bronchogenic carcinomas. The complete histological response rate of PDT with brachytherapy was 97%, leading to the conclusion that the combination of PDT with brachytherapy was safe with strong therapeutic efficacy in this group of patients with lung cancer [10]. Additional clinical studies have also demonstrated the effectiveness of PDT as a palliative therapy to relieve airway obstruction resulting from Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\nOur study has several limitations. First, our study uses secondary data and consists of persons who were at least 18 years of age. We did not have data related to smoking status, pulmonary function tests, tumor location and type of chemotherapy.\nPerformance status is an important measure of the effects of tumor symptoms, with other comorbidities, on a patient's day-to-day function, such as ability to self-care. However, in the NCDB database, this information is not available. At the same time the CharlsonDeyo comorbidity index score, which is a good predictor of mortality, is available and we have adjusted our analysis using this score. Thus, our comparison between treatments can be considered as exploratory, and future prospective studies using performance status data can validate our findings.\nWhile usefulness of NCDB in examining cancer diagnosis and primary cancer treatment is well documented, it must be noted that NCDB is not a population-based database, as NCDB cases are identified from the hospitals where they present for cancer diagnosis and/or its treatment. At the same time, NCDB captures about 75% of all incident cancers in the United States, and thus has an advantage over other cancer registry data. Additionally, NCDBincludes more comprehensive data on certain treatments such as chemotherapy [37]. Despite these limitations, PDT appears to offer improved disease control and survival benefit for advanced Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. It should be considered more often as part of multidisciplinary thoracic oncology care.",

The key independent variable was exposure to PDT, with radiation therapy alone as reference category. We also carried out similar analysis with chemotherapy alone as the reference category. The models were adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics (age, gender, race and ethnicity, education, income, geographic area, insurance status), disease severity (cancer stage), medical comor-\nbidity, and propensity score. We used Statistical Analysis System (SAS), Version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA), for analysis.",

      "content": "Future research in Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with stage III or stage IV disease can identify the pathways via which PDT helps in improving patient survival. In addition, the impact of this association on the health-related quality of life among Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients needs to be addressed. In summary, our hospital registry-based study spanning up to 12 years following the diagnosis of stage III or stage IV Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) shows that PDT, in combination with other systemic therapy and local therapy, was associated with significantly improved overall survival. Thus, providers need to assess the incremental benefits of PDT in Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with stage III or stage IV disease.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, R.J., and S.C.; methodology, R.J. and S.C.; software, R.J. and S.C.; validation, R.J. and S.C.; formal analysis, R.J. and S.C.; investigation, R.J. and S.C.; resources, R.J.; data curation, R.J. and S.C.; writing-original draft preparation, R.J. and S.C.; writingreview and editing, R.J., S.C., A.V. and R.R.A.; visualization, R.J. and S.C.; supervision, R.J.; project administration, R.J.; funding acquisition, R.J.
