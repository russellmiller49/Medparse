Kovitz, MD\nValue-based care is evolving with a focus on improving ef /uniFB01 ciency, reducing cost, and enhancing the patient experience. Interventional pulmonology has the opportunity to lead an effective value-based care model. This model is supported by the relatively low cost of pulmonary procedures and has the potential to improve ef /uniFB01 ciencies in thoracic care. We discuss key strategies to evaluate and improve ef /uniFB01 ciency in interventional pulmonology practice and describe our experience in developing an interventional pulmonology suite. Such a model can be adapted to other specialty areas and may encourage a more coordinated approach to specialty care.\nKEY WORDS: business plan; interventional pulmonology; Medicare; value-based care\nInterventional pulmonology (IP) has evolved into a dedicated subspecialty that encompasses minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic thoracic procedures. These are performed by a relatively small number of IP physicians. Historically, pulmonologists have practiced traditional pulmonary and critical care medicine and have not prioritized the advancement of pulmonary procedures. 1,2 Many communities have either limited or no access to IP services. Barriers include relatively low reimbursement coupled with increased technical effort, training requirements, and physician time compared with other aspects of practice, such as critical care, evaluation and management services, and sleep medicine. 1,3 Current reimbursement patterns do not incentivize\npulmonary procedures necessary to optimize patient care because they are neither time ef /uniFB01 cient nor cost effective. 4,5 A dedicated IP team offers signi /uniFB01 cant advantages to not only a pulmonary practice but to hospital systems as well. Patients with potential IPrelated issues can be evaluated expeditiously, and appropriate procedures can be performed by the same set of physicians, therefore offering enhanced continuity of care. Physicians who specialize and have expertise in these services do optimize quality, ef /uniFB01 ciency, and patient convenience. Over the last 10 years, we have built a successful IP program, which is regionally and nationally recognized. The IP service was branded as the Chicago Chest Center separate from the larger practice to encourage competition-free referrals.\nABBREVIATIONS: IP = interventional pulmonology; MACRA = Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act\nAFFILIATIONS: From the Chicago Chest Center (Drs Desai and Kovitz; and Ms French), Elk Grove Village, IL; the Suburban Lung Associates (Drs Desai, Diamond, and Kovitz; and Ms French), Elk Grove Village, IL; and the Section of Pulmonary, Critical Care, Sleep and Allergy (Drs Desai and Kovitz), University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL.\nCORRESPONDENCE TO: Neeraj R.

      "content": "Value-based programs are patient-centered and use a coordinated team-based approach with an overall goal to improve quality of care. 9 Value-based programs reward health-care providers with incentive payments for the quality of care they provide to patients with managed care or government insurances. The most familiar of these is sponsored by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (MACRA). In theory, these programs are part of the larger quality strategy to reform how health care is delivered and ultimately reimbursed. The goals of value-based programs are better care for individuals, better health for populations, and lower cost. Whether or not the proposed value-based programs will positively impact patient care is not the subject of this paper. Rather, they are part of the current practice environment and our described approach seeks to adapt to this environment.",

      "content": "The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act was implemented in 2008 as early legislation addressing value-based care (Fig 1). One important\nprovision of the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act was the allocation of federal funding to assist low-income Medicare bene /uniFB01 ciaries to apply for programs that make Medicare affordable. The Affordable Care Act followed in 2010. The stated goal is to provide comprehensive health insurance options that will expand coverage, hold insurance company ' s accountable, lower health-care costs, guarantee more choice, and enhance the quality of care for everyone in the United States. Several programs that focused on particular disease states were developed between 2012 and 2014. MACRA was passed in 2015. Under MACRA, providers can choose to participate in one of two tracks, either the Advanced Alternative Payment Model or the Merit-based Incentive Payment System. Advanced Alternative Payment Models are essentially cost of care risk models where a program has a pool of dollars with which to provide care to a group of patients with similar conditions. Care that is cost-effective results in net pro /uniFB01 t for the organization; whereas inef /uniFB01 cient care results in a net loss. In theory, this disincentivizes unnecessary care or procedures, but quality effect is less clear. A Meritbased Incentive Payment System combines the Physician Quality Reporting System, the Value-Based Payment Modi /uniFB01 er, and the Medicare Electronic Health Record Incentive Program. With value-based care and quality payment models, hospitals are gauged on measures of outcome such as mortality and complications, healthcare-associated infections, patient safety, patient experience, and process. 10 This alphabet soup of programs represents the ongoing changes in health care that are best adapted by developing and maintaining ef /uniFB01 ciency of service.",

Using one location with a dedicated experienced staff routinely doing complex cases in volume improves the ability of the hospital ' s physicians to do high-risk cases in a cost-effective setting.\nThe increased volume of IP cases increases downstream revenue by increasing referrals to thoracic surgeons, medical and radiation oncologists, pathologists, radiologists, and others as a result of the increased throughput of lung cancer diagnosis.\nThe value to the facility of a designated IP suite is easy to recognize. The facility-based charges for each procedure will be a welcome revenue stream. More importantly, the facility will be able to market itself as an institution that offers cutting-edge IP services in a state-of-the-art treatment area. This will result in a greater number of patients remaining within the institution for advanced care.

If an institution is starting from a different point in program development for IP or for any service, consideration of the cost of space or construction, equipment, staff, and the like needs to be factored in. Financial projections for our IP suite look very strong. For illustration purposes, two proforma statements with volume and revenue projections are shown: one with a very conservative volume estimate and the other with a little more aggressive estimate (Figs 4, 5). Both scenarios demonstrate pro /uniFB01 tability.\nThe growth of IP is rapid, and the number of IP procedures across the country have steadily increased. Annual growth is expected to remain strong because there is growing acceptance and greater awareness of the /uniFB01 eld of IP. Our program has consistently shown growth justifying the range of our estimates. Conservative estimates are based on starting at the existing volume with a subsequent increase of 5% per year. The more aggressive estimates are based on an increase in volume of 15% per year.\nThe breakeven point or the time until the $500,000 investment is paid back is 8.3 months with the conservative estimate of 5% increase in IP volume and 6.3 months with the aggressive estimate of 15% increase in IP volume.
