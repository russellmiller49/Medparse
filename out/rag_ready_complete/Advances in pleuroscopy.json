      "title": "2 | TECHNICAL AND DIAGNOSTIC ASPECTS",
      "content": "Pleuroscopy is a simple, safe method of exploration of the pleural cavity. 7 It is a minimally invasive procedure that is performed by a pulmonologist in the endoscopy suite, under local anesthesia or mild conscious sedation with cardiovascular and respiratory monitoring. Thoracoscopy can be done either with a rigid or with a semi-rigid instrument, by a single port of entry or with two ports of entry. The diameter of trocar ranges from 7 to 11 mm, while the diameter of the optics ranges from 6 to 10 mm and that of the biopsy forceps from 4 to 6 mm.\nIts sensitivity ranges from 92 to 97% 8 and its speci /uniFB01 city from 99% to 100% 9 in patients with malignant pleural e /uniFB00 usion. Biopsies may be taken not only from the parietal, but\nThe authors contributed equally in searching the bibliography and writing the review.\n|\n|\nalso from the visceral and diaphragmatic pleura, since during thoracoscopy the whole pleural cavity is inspected under direct view. 9 When adhesions are found during the exploration of the pleural cavity, adhesionlysis can be performed in order to explore the whole pleural space. 10,11\nE /uniFB00 orts regarding patients ' selection for thoracoscopy have been done. Martensson 12 performed logistic analysis using seven variables to discriminate malignant from nonmalignant disease in 334 patients with undiagnosed pleural e /uniFB00 usion, in order to select patients for diagnostic thoracoscopy. They correctly predicted in 79% of the e /uniFB00 usion cases, with strongest positive predicted value variable for malignancy the presence of bloody e /uniFB00 usion. In the contrary, the variables with the strongest negative predictive value for malignancy were the presence of eosinophils > 30% in the pleural /uniFB02 uid as well as age younger than 50 years. 12\nRecently, we published a study 13 designed to identify prognostic variables in patients presenting initially with undiagnosed pleural e /uniFB00 usion proven to be malignant after diagnostic pleuroscopy. We found that the primary tumor, the ECOG performance status, the number of white blood cells, and the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (N/L ratio) were predictors of survival. These factors may help physicians select patients for treatment and/or interventional procedures such as thoracoscopy.\nJanssen et al. 14 have followed their 208 patients with inconclusive thoracoscopy out of 709 patients who underwent thoracoscopy for undiagnosed pleural e /uniFB00 usion; 391 of them (55%) had malignant pleural disease and 183 (26%) a true benign pleural e /uniFB00 usion. Therefore, after long-term follow-up the sensitivity of diagnostic thoracoscopy was 91% and the speci /uniFB01 city 100%. They suggested a wait and see approach, in such patient population, unless repeated thoracentesis suggests a progressive pleural disease. 14\nWe also published our experience with patients with undiagnosed pleural e /uniFB00 usion who underwent thoracoscopy for diagnostic reasons. 15 From the 175 patients with undiagnosed pleural e /uniFB00 usion who underwent thoracoscopy for diagnostic purposes, /uniFB01 nally 129 were diagnosed with malignancy (including 9 patients with eosinophilic pleural e /uniFB00 usion), 36 have shown a true benign disease, and 10 patients had to be followed for idiopathic eosinophilic pleural e /uniFB00 usion. Usually these e /uniFB00 usions have a benign course with resolution within a year as has been shown by our extensive follow-up period (60 months). 15 We can conclude that when a non-speci /uniFB01 c pleuritis is diagnosed histologically, after initial thoracoscopy for pleural e /uniFB00 usion, a follow-up must be undertaken, considering that there are few probabilities of a secondary malignant evolution.\nThoracoscopy in pleural disease without pleural e /uniFB00 usion is another ' gray zone ' for respiratory physicians. Before the chest ultrasound (U/S) application in pleural disease, recog-\nnition of computed tomography features such as pachypleuritis and/or retraction of the hemithorax, together with the age of the disease were (and still are) key factors to choose entering or not into the pleural cavity when pleural /uniFB02 uid is absent. Chest U/S has changed de /uniFB01 nitely the approach in pleural disease, since from the simple pleural tap to the minimally invasive pleuroscopy, its use provides higher diagnostic accuracy and comfort for both patient and physician. 16 It is highly indicated in medical thoracoscopy in order to choose the right spot for trocar introduction, especially when empyema is suspected. 17\nThe study of Marchetti et al. 18 opens a new horizon in pleuroscopy, changing the approach of patients without pleural e /uniFB00 usion by using chest U/S. Indeed, the presence of the ' sliding sign, ' de /uniFB01 ning the unrestricted movement of the visceral over the parietal pleura, support the decision for performing diagnostic thoracoscopy, regardless the amount of adhesions. The study by Marchetti et al. de /uniFB01 nitely shifts the indication of pleuroscopy in patients with pleural disease without e /uniFB00 usion, from the ' gray zone ' to the ' green zone ' of practice for respiratory physicians. 19",

      "title": "3 | THORACOSCOPY AND MALIGNANT PLEURAL MESOTHELIOMA",
      "content": "Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a neoplasm with increasing incidence and poor prognosis, since median survival is 12 months with death resulting from respiratory failure. In the United States MPM occurs in about 2500 individuals every year, while 72 000 cases are expected to occur in the next 20 years. In Western Europe 5000 patients die of the disease each year. 20 Thoracoscopy is the best method to obtain the diagnosis of MPM when suspected on clinical or radiological data. 21 Thoracoscopy gives the advantage of obtaining multiple and deep biopsies making the diagnosis of mesothelioma easier. Di /uniFB00 erential diagnosis from other primaries, such as adenocarcinoma or sarcoma, as well as mesothelial hyperplasia is important and need speci /uniFB01 c pathologic training 22 (Table 1).\nThe diagnostic yield of thoracoscopy in MPM is > 90%. Boutin and Rey 23 analyzed prospectively the records of 188 patients with MPM in order to compare the diagnostic value of thoracoscopic biopsy, /uniFB02 uid cytology, and closed needle biopsy. They achieved a diagnosis by /uniFB02 uid cytology in 26%, needle biopsy in 21%, combined /uniFB02 uid cytology and needle biopsy in 39%, and thoracoscopy in 98%. Thoracoscopy reduces the need for thoracotomy as it provides equally quantity and quality pleural biopsies for diagnosis. 24\nMesothelioma is a malignant tumor of the pleural cavity which /uniFB01 rst develops on the parietal pleura and then spreads to the visceral pleura (Figure 1). The involvement of the visceral pleura has been found to be associated with a worse\n|\nprognosis and therefore is considered an important prognostic factor. 25 The diagnostic yield of cytological examination for the diagnosis of MPM varies from 4 to 77%. 25 Pinelli et al. reported that the diagnostic yield of cytological examination was signi /uniFB01 cantly higher in patients with MPM and visceral pleural invasion. 26 In 82% of patients with visceral pleura invasion, the cytological examination was positive, while 30% of patients with visceral pleura invasion had negative cytological examination.\nIn a recent study by Levallet et al., 27 c-mesenchymal -epithelial transition (c-MET) has been found to be a potential prognostic biomarker in MPM. In 157 patients with MPM, positive expression of c-MET was found in 119 samples. In patients in whom the localization of c-MET was exclusively to plasma membrane the median overall survival was 25 months compared to 13 months for the rest of the patients. Whether c-MET targeted therapies will help patients with positive c-MET plasma membrane immunostaining will be answered in the future trials.\nMarkers with negative prognostic value have been reported such as serum SMRP, elevated levels of VEGF in pleural e /uniFB00 usion and overexertion of VEGF in immunohisto-\nchemistry, and increased microvessel density. 28 More studies are needed in order to con /uniFB01 rm or not the prognostic value of these markers.",

      "content": "When managing patients with pleural infection, the goal is to provide treatment to the patient, with the less morbidity and mortality, less hospital stay, and to avoid the need for surgical treatment and debridement. 33 The treatment of pleural infection depends on the stage of the disease and compromises antibiotics with or without chest tube drainage, use of /uniFB01 brinolytics, medical thoracoscopy management, or surgical management. The use of /uniFB01 brinolytics in the management of pleural infections has been under a lot of criticism. There are studies that have shown good results with the use of intrapleural /uniFB01 brinolytics especially in complicated parapneumonic\npleural e /uniFB00 usions. 34 This good outcome was not the case with the MIST 1 study by Maskell et al. 35 Many methodological parts of this study have received a lot of criticism. Probably the use of intrapleural /uniFB01 brinolytics in the earlier stages of the parapneumonic e /uniFB00 usions has better results than using them in empyema.\nMedical thoracoscopy in the treatment of pleural infection is used in order to mechanically remove the infected material, to lyse the adhesions which are present, and to allow the re-expansion of the lung (Figure 2). Before the entry into the pleural cavity, an ultrasound of the hemithorax must be done in order to choose the correct point of entry. In a study by Brutsche et al., 127 patients with multiloculated, complicated parapneumonic pleural e /uniFB00 usions were treated with medical thoracoscopy and about half of them with intrapleural /uniFB01 brinolytics as an adjuvant therapy. The success rate was 91% with only 9% complications. 36\nAlthough, it seems that the use of medical thoracoscopy in the treatment of complicated parapneumonic e /uniFB00 usions must be done early in the infectious course o /uniFB00 ering less\npain, lower cost, few complications, and avoiding surgical thoracoscopy under general anesthesia especially in patients un /uniFB01 t for surgical management, a good coordination between surgical and medical teams is the cornerstone to lower mortality rates in this patient population. 37,38 The success rate of medical thoracoscopy and Video Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery in patients with complicated parapneumonic pleural e /uniFB00 usions and empyema are described in Table 2. 36,39 -44\nWhat is needed are prospective, well strati /uniFB01 ed on the stage of parapneumonic pleural e /uniFB00 usion and empyema, multicenter studies with many patients in order to con /uniFB01 rm the role of medical thoracoscopy in parapneumonic e /uniFB00 usions and empyema.",

      "content": "The semi-rigid pleuroscope (model LTF 160 or 240; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) is working like the /uniFB02 exible bronchoscope. It consists of a handle and a shaft that measures 7 mm in outer diameter and 27 cm in length. The /uniFB02 exible tip is movable by a lever on the handle, which allows 2-way angulation 160 8 up and 130 8 down. It has a 2.8-mm working channel that accommodates biopsy forceps, needles and other accessories, and is compatible with various electrosurgical and laser procedures. 48 In a meta-analysis by Agarwal et al., 47 which included 17 studies with a total number of 755 patients, the semirigid pleuroscope showed a sensitivity of 91% and a speci /uniFB01 city of 100% in diagnosing exudative pleural e /uniFB00 usions. Although the average sample size is double with rigid pleuroscopy compared with that of semi-rigid, the diagnostic accuracy is about the same. 54\nOne of the problems of the use of semi-rigid pleuroscope is the biopsy of thickened pleura. In order to overcome this problem, Sasada et al. 55 proposed the use of a new electrocautery technique using an insulated-tip knife through the working channel of the semi-rigid pleuroscope. They reported their experience in 20 patients, and with the use of the insulated-tip knife they could get full thickness parietal pleura biopsies with a diagnostic yield higher (85%) compared with the standard /uniFB02 exible forceps (60%).\nAnother limitation of semi-rigid pleuroscopy is the size of the pleural biopsies and that usually are of insu /uniFB03 cient depth (Figure 3). To overcome this limitation, Thomas et al. 56 used /uniFB02 exible cryoprobe biopsies of the parietal pleura through the working channel of the semirigid pleuroscope. In this feasibility and safety study which included twenty-two patients with pleural e /uniFB00 usion, the sampling of parietal pleura with /uniFB02 exible cryoprobe was feasible and safe. The cryoprobe pleural samples were signi /uniFB01 cantly larger than the samples obtained with the /uniFB02 exible forceps, deeper, and of better quality with less crash artifacts. The diagnostic yield was 90%, comparable with the diagnostic yield of the conventional biopsies.",

On the other hand, more time is needed for the mini thoracoscopic procedure and the biopsy specimen size is small, a problem that can be overcome by taking more samples. 58 It is ideal for patients with small e /uniFB00 usions and narrow intercostal spaces (Figure 4).",

Infrared thoracoscopy that can detect two different wave-lengths of infrared light can display indocyanine green (ICG) with an absorption peak in the infrared light region (805 nm) as blue. The normal lung is imaged as blue while the lung lesions are imaged as white due to less blood /uniFB02 ow.

The decreased blood /uniFB02 ow of bullous lesions is detected by a decreased indocyanine green intensity. 59 Gotoh et al. 59 reported their experience with infrared thoracoscopy in eight patients with spontaneous pneumothorax. Infrared throacoscopy helped them identify small bullous lesions that were undetectable with white light. Because the blue-white contrast lasts about 3-5 min and you cannot inject more ICG, there is no enough time to explore the whole lung surface.\n|\nThis is one of the problems of the infrared thoracoscopy but otherwise is a rapid and safe method for identifying small bullous lesions.",

Pleural biopsies are easily performed with a high diagnostic yield. Treatment of recurrent pleural e /uniFB00 usions can be achieved with pleurodesis, as well as the treatment of recurrent\n|\nA\npneumothorax. Sympathectomy, treatment of pleural infections is the other therapeutic option with medical thoracoscopy. Newer techniques, such as narrow band imaging thoracoscopy, infrared thoracoscopy, auto /uniFB02 uorescence thoracoscopy are o /uniFB00 ering a promising future for medical thoracoscopy.",
