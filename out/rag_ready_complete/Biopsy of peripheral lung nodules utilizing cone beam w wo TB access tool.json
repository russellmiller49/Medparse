      "content": "Currently there are several techniques for bronchoscopic diagnosis of peripheral lung lesions. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) with and without radial endobronchial ultrasound (r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)) has complimented standard bronchoscopy and has demonstrated to be a safe and minimally invasive diagnostic modality (1). The diagnostic yield from this approach has ranged from 55.7% to 80% and the highest yield occurs with lesions with an air-bronchus sign and size >2 cm (2-5). Endoscopic sampling of lesions that are more distant from the bronchus or  that  have  no  connection  with  an  airway  has  been extremely challenging and likely accounts for a significant portion of the variable success of ENB in literature. The Transbronchial Access T ool (TBAT) is a novel endoscopic technique that creates a virtual pathway to the lesion and is less limited by location of the airway. The CrossCountry TM Transbronchial Access T ool (Covidien TM ,  Plymouth, MN, USA) is a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved TBAT device that utilizes a catheter equipped guide sheath for a trans-parenchymal approach to a distal lesion. Preliminary studies have shown this to be a safe option with difficult to reach lesion (6-8). Cone beam computer tomography (CBCT) is a real-time onsite extrathoracic navigational modality that is used in conjunction with bronchoscopy and has provided improvement in diagnostic yield with radiation exposure equivalent to one-time low dose screening CT (9,10). All three of the above modalities have reasonable diagnostic yields when used independently. While utilizing the above tools there are often situations where one technique will not suffice, prompting the use of multiple modalities to obtain the most efficient and accurate diagnosis. Little is known, however, about the complication rate and diagnostic yield when ENB, TBAT and CBCT are used together. Ours is a retrospective review of 22 cases in which CBCT, ENB and r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) were utilized with or without TBAT and set out to determine the safety and diagnostic yield of the combined modalities in the evaluation of the peripheral nodule (PN) or mass.",

The number of PN located in left upper lung (LUL) was 11, accounted for 50% of total patients with PN. T wo of the 11 patients had a history of lung cancer (all were classified as Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)). Of the PNs in the LUL, 4 (46.4%) were visible on fluoroscopy. The mean size of PN in LUL was 1.98 (range, 1.2-2.8) cm.\nSufficient samples for a histological diagnosis were obtained in 21 patients, in the remaining 1 patient the procedure was aborted due to lack of catheter apposition and presence of significant vessel interposed between the catheter and lesion. Histological diagnoses were successfully achieved in 17 of 22 patients and the total diagnostic yield was 77.2%. In contrast to yield of benign diagnosis (17.6%), the yield of malignant diagnosis was 82.3%, including 6 adenocarcinomas (42.8%), 6 squamous (42.8%) and\n1 carcinoid tumor of lung cancer (7.1%).\nThe diagnostic yield of PN was summarized in Table 4 .

      "title": "Discussion",
      "content": "The advent and introduction of tools such as CBCT and TBAT suggest the potential to improve bronchoscopy diagnostic yield in discrete lesions. Combined with TBAT, there is the suggestion of further improvement especially relative to the 'off-airway' type of aberrancies. Herein, we present a series utilizing ENB and CBCT guided biopsies of peripheral pulmonary nodules and in certain cases done in conjunction with the use of TBAT. T o our knowledge this is only the second and the largest series of its kind. In this series, there were no procedural complications. Overall diagnostic yield was 77.2% and TBAT was used in 32% (7) of the cases. In all seven of the cases where the TBAT was deployed, a diagnosis was made. TBAT was not deployed in\nRUL, right upper lobe; LUL, left upper lobe; RLL, right lower lobe; LLL, left lower lobe; RML, right middle lobe; TBAT, Transbronchial Access Tool.\nMALT, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue.\nthe remainder of the cases for two reasons. First, given the data from the various systems, r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), CBCT, ENB, etc. it appeared as if the catheter was positioned appropriately relative to lesion. Alternatively, we would have desired to deploy the TBAT device in one case but we were unable to as a consequence of the inability to approximate an appropriate trajectory between the catheter and the lesion in a three-dimensional volume. In addition, there appeared to be vasculature interposed between the position of the catheter and the target such that even if we were able to better approximate the trajectory that would have also potentially prevented deployment. In the remaining non-TBAT cases we navigated with combination of modalities and, as discussed, appeared to be able to position the catheter either adjacent to or within the target area without having to go off-airway. Interestingly, all non-diagnostic samples were obtained from the LUL and correlated with higher BMI. We hypothesize that several factors may play a role: First air flow distribution within the left upper lobe bronchus in a recumbent mechanically ventilated obese patient may predispose that area to greater atelectasis and more airway collapse especially with posterior lesions. This would, therefore, potentially obviate the benefits of any of these tools. Second, three of the four LUL biopsies were conducted relatively early in the process and may reflect on the understanding of where to best deploy the various tools when compared with the\nmore traditional approach. For example, similar to Bowling and colleagues, we found that in all TBAT cases the EWC would straighten as soon as the catheter deployed. After some effort, we accounted for this by manipulating the EWC to a position that was at a position to compensate for relative tool stiffness once the biopsy tool was introduced the catheter would straighten into the lesion.\nThis series highlights the unique challenges faced by the endoscopist during a biopsy of a discrete lung aberrancies and peripheral pulmonary nodules. The three main challenges to a successful biopsy are intraprocedural localization (i.e., successful navigation), appropriate position of the catheter to the target as well as appropriate biopsy tool selection.\nIntraprocedural localization, has been addressed with several advanced guiding techniques. Advent of these modalities has raised the diagnostic yield anywhere from 61% to 80%. CBCT offers a unique real-time, albeit static 3-dimensional localization. Its advantages include allowing onsite decision regarding type of access and biopsy tool needed as well as outlining the lesion and its apposition to other intrathoracic structures. Additionally, some nodules are eccentrically positioned relative to the catheter and others may or may not have an airway leading to them and thus utilization tools such as CBCT, r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), ENB, etc. would again allow for different choices depending on the relative position of the catheter and the target with respect to the potential tools' choices available as well as for potential\nRUL, right upper lobe; LUL, left upper lobe; RLL, right lower lobe; LLL, left lower lobe; RML, right middle lobe; CBCT, cone beam computed tomography; RUS, radial ultrasound.\ndeployment of a TBAT. This can also allow for successful navigation to be less dependent on a 'bronchus sign'.\nFurther, once successful localization and positioning is controlled for, it would seem reasonable to suggest that the remaining variable in a non-diagnostic sample is appropriate tool selection. This is also likely dependent on catheter's apposition to the lesion and how it changes after each biopsy sample is obtained. Thus, the decision regarding appropriate tool selection requires continuous real time re-assessment with combination of static and dynamic diagnostic modalities such as r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), CBCT and ENB.\nIn our series, the combination of dynamic and static mapping and the use of TBAT allows safe and effective positioning of the biopsy tool regardless of the presence of an airway and with the potential concomitant benefit of improving yield and negative predictive value. The combination of these modalities may be an attractive option for patients who are poor surgical candidate and have peripheral lung lesions that are difficult to access with trans-thoracic needle aspiration (difficult angle of approach, depth of location, underlying emphysema). Additionally, in some circumstances, it can provide an option of one procedure that allows for not only diagnosis, but also for mediastinal staging with Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and placement of fiducial markers into difficult to reach lesions.\nFurther  study  to  confirm  these  approaches  and demonstrate true diagnostic yield will be necessary as these tools become increasingly part of bronchoscopy.",
