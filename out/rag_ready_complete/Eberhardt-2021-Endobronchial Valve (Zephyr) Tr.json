      "content": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide, with an estimated  328  million  people  worldwide  with  this  disease  [1]. Emphysema is a phenotype of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and is a progressive debilitating disease characterized by irreversible destruction of the alveolar tissue [2, 3]. The resultant progressive hyperinflation and gas trapping with impaired respiratory mechanics cause patients to experience chronic dyspnea, reduced exercise tolerance, and have a poor healthrelated quality of life.\nA minimally invasive bronchoscopic lung volume reduction technique of implanting one-way duckbill valves is now established as means of treating the hyperinflation of emphysema for a group of selected patients [4-6]. The goal of the valve deployed in the bronchial lumen is to block the inspiratory airflow into targeted, hyperinflated regions of the lung, while allowing trapped air to escape upon exhalation until the volume is decreased. The Zephyr ® endobronchial  valve  (Pulmonx  Corporation,  Redwood City, CA, USA) has been previously studied in multiple prospective, randomized trials in patients with heterogeneous emphysema [7-13].\nClinical evidence indicates that by achieving lobar occlusion in the absence of collateral ventilation, significant lung volume reduction can be obtained with associated good clinical responses. The findings from retrospective analysis of data from both the US and European cohorts of  the  VENT study where these criteria were met suggested that meaningful responses can be achieved in both heterogeneous  and  homogeneous  emphysema  patients [14]. This was further supported by a prospective pilot study in subjects with severe homogeneous emphysema which demonstrated that Zephyr valve placement in such subjects is feasible with an acceptable safety profile [15], and from the prospective, multicenter, randomized, con-\ntrolled  study  IMPACT,  that  demonstrated  clinically meaningful improvements in the lung function, exercise capacity, and quality of life at 3 months [12] in patients with  homogeneous  emphysema  treated  with  Zephyr valves, and the homogeneous subset in STELVIO [10]. The present report provides longer term safety and effectiveness data on Zephyr valve treatment in patients with homogeneous emphysema.",

The shortterm safety of the Zephyr valve procedure compared to SoC out to 3 months has previously been reported [12]. There is a higher frequency of respiratory adverse events in the short-term Zephyr valve group compared to the SoC group. The most significant serious adverse event (SAE) in the Zephyr valve group being pneumothorax and Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. Table 2 shows the SAEs for the treatment period (day of procedure to 30 days), the period from 31 days to 6 months (both groups), and from >6 to 12 months (Zephyr valve group only; SoC subjects were excited for crossover option at 6 months). During the treatment period, 44.1% subjects in the Zephyr valve group compared to 1.0% subjects in the SoC group reported one or more respiratory SAEs. From 31 days to 6\nmonths, 35% subjects in the Zephyr valve group and 26% subjects in the SoC group reported one or more respiratory  SAE  (Table  2).  During  the  period  from  >6  to  12 months, the percentage of subjects with respiratory SAEs in the Zephyr valve group remained stable (30%). Beyond the  31-day  treatment  period,  the  most  frequently  observed respiratory SAE was Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation requiring hospitalization, which occurred at similar rates in the Zephyr  valve  and  SoC  groups  during  the  31-day  to 6-month period (19 vs. 20%, respectively). Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations requiring hospitalization were also stable in the Zephyr valve group out to 12 months (16%). Two subjects (4.0%) in the SoC group died as a result of respiratory failure during the 6-month period. There were no deaths in the Zephyr valve group out to 12 months.\nThe most common post-procedural complication was pneumothorax with 13 events in 11 (25.6%) subjects in\nthe initial EBV cohort, of which 11 (84.6%) events were severe, and 2 (15.4%) events were moderate. The time of occurrence from the most recent bronchoscopy procedure and the management of each pneumothorax is summarized in Figure 4.",

      "title": "Discussion",
      "content": "Patients with severe homogeneous emphysema with hyperinflated lungs and low lung function remain poor candidates for lung volume reduction surgery, and thus are severely limited in their treatment options [17]. The findings from the present, randomized, controlled trial demonstrate  durable  clinical  benefits  of  Zephyr  valve treatment over 12 months in patients with homogeneous emphysema.\nThe increased RV in advanced Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as an expression of the static hyperinflation further increases disproportionately under exercise, thus resulting in a high-end expiratory lung volume followed by shortness of breath and a reduced exercise capacity of these patients [18]. Thus, for lung volume reduction procedures, RV is particularly important, as it is both a predictor for better outcome and an objective outcome measure resulting from the physiological changes achieved with Zephyr valve treatment [19]. Therapeutic strategies therefore have to aim for a significant reduction of the hyperinflation and lung volumes in order to improve respiratory mechanics, physical activity, and even symptoms [18]. Additionally, as Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is  a  progressively worsening disease, particularly in patients  with  homogeneous  disease,  where  the  decline  is rapid [20], treatment strategies that prevent or slow down further deterioration can be very impactful.\nThe data from this randomized, controlled trial validate the earlier findings of a smaller feasibility study [15], and subgroup analysis of the VENT [7] and STELVIO studies [10, 21], which showed the effectiveness of Zephyr valves in patients with emphysema of homogeneous distribution with benefits that are clinically significant, and extend the previous 3-month findings [12] with benefits that are maintained over a longer period. Determination of the degree of emphysema in this study was based on the voxel density at -910 HU on the CT rather than at -950 HU to be consistent with prior studies, and is unlikely to have impacted target lobe selections or outcomes.\nThe present study showed clinically and statistically significant  improvements in the hyperinflation (reduction in RV) and other important Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) outcomes in the Zephyr valve-treated subjects over the SoC controls at 6\nTable 2. Respiratory SAEs by time period\nmonths. In order to determine the efficacy of valve therapy, the statistical significance alone is not sufficient. The MCID which better describes the real clinical benefit of the patients in daily life should be considered. Therefore, thresholds have been defined in the past years for different parameters like RV, TLVR, FEV1, SGRQ, or 6MWD for patients with severe emphysema. Individual subjectlevel  data  at  6  months  showed  significantly  more  responders based on the MCID for each of the clinical outcome  measures  of  FEV1,  RV,  6MWD,  SGRQ,  CAT, mMRC, and the BODE index in the Zephyr valve versus the SoC group, while a larger number of subjects in the SoC group deteriorated by more than the MCID threshold as reflected in the waterfall plots for FEV1, SGRQ, and 6MWD in Figure 2. Although the protocol recommended consideration of a repeat bronchoscopy for valve adjustment in subjects who either had less than a 12% increase in FEV1, or <10% decrease in RV, or no evidence of lobar volume reduction at 30 days, this was not a mandated requirement. As such, the investigators opted not to perform a repeat bronchoscopy in 11 cases, and in 4 cases they performed a bronchoscopy but did not perform a valve adjustment; none of the patients refused a second procedure. A treatment reversal was not offered in case of a lack of response, although this is often the case in the current clinical practice.\nThe clinical benefits were persistent at 12 months, with the 12-month responder rates in the Zephyr valve group comparable to responder rates at 6 months. While the magnitude of change over baseline was smaller in some\nendpoints for the Zephyr valve-treated subjects at 12 versus 6 months, these outcomes remained improved over baseline,  and  for  most  measures  were  not  significantly different when compared with the 6-month visit; unfortunately, without a control group, the effect size is hard to determine. This observation is consistent with previous reports from both surgical and endoscopic lung volume reduction studies [17, 18, 21]. To better appreciate the magnitude of change that was observed, it is helpful to consider the natural progression of the disease in this patient  population. In NETT, at 1 year, the nonhigh-risk untreated control population that included patients with both heterogeneous and homogeneous emphysema had a decline of 40 m in the 6MWD, and an increase of 3.2 points in the SGRQ score [17]. More recent data from the RENEW study evaluating endobronchial coils similarly showed declines in homogeneous patients (RV > 225%, medical management only group), as indicated by worsening of key measures at 1 year with a 2.4% decrease in FEV1, a 13.5 m decrease in the 6MWD, and a 2.1-point increase in the SGRQ score [22]. The fact that medically managed patients with severe homogeneous emphysema are observed to deteriorate more rapidly over time provides  an  important  context  for  the  evaluation  of  new treatments in the severe homogeneous emphysema patient  population.  Importantly,  the  SGRQ  data  at  12 months in the Zephyr valve group continued to demonstrate an improvement with a decline of 4 points compared with baseline, indicating clinically meaningful improvements in quality of life after 1 year.\nThe most frequent respiratory SAE reported during the 31-day to 6-month period was Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, which  was  similar  between  the  Zephyr  valve  and  SoC groups, and pneumothorax that occurred in the Zephyr valve group. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations were also stable in the Zephyr  valve  group  out  to  the  6-  to  12-month  period (16.3%). While the small sample size in this study is not sufficient  to  show  statistical  significance  for  the  safety endpoints,  the  numerically  lower  incidence  of  typical Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-related  respiratory  and  cardiac  events  in  the Zephyr valve group compared to SoC suggests that patients do not get worse. In fact, the data from the larger LIBERATE study, a RCT of Zephyr valve versus medically managed control [13] showed a reduction in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations in Zephyr valve-treated patients over the longer term. The timing of post-procedure pneumothoraces was similar to that seen in the LIBERATE study in heterogeneous patients with the majority of pneumothoraces occurring within the first 3 days after valve placement and a smaller number occurring late [13]. Thus, it is imperative that patients be appropriately educated at the time of discharge on the symptoms of a pneumothorax and to seek urgent medical attention if symptoms of a pneumothorax occur. Importantly, there were no deaths in the Zephyr valve group in the IMPACT study over the 12-month follow-up, while 2 deaths occurred in the SoC group who were monitored out to 6 months. Of note, some patients in the present study met the criteria for the high-risk population in the NETT trial (defined as FEV1 ≤ 20% predicted and either homogeneous emphysema or a carbon monoxide diffusing capacity of ≤20% predicted).  In  NETT,  these  patients  experienced  about  a  20% death rate over 12-month follow-up [17, 23]. Eight subjects (5 Zephyr valve, 3 SoC) in the IMPACT study met the NETT high-risk definition. Of these 8 subjects, there was 1 death in the  SoC  group  (1/3  subjects,  33%)  and none in the Zephyr valve group (0/5 subjects).\nThe main limitation of the study was not maintaining the SoC control group out to 12 months. SoC subjects were crossed over to Zephyr valve treatment at 6 months, and thus were not available  for  comparison  to  Zephyr valve at 12 months. While important scientifically, withholding  of  a  commercially  available  treatment  option over a longer period for this needy patient group represented an ethical and practical challenge. Another limitation was the lack of a sham control group. Because valves are visible on CT and X-ray, a sham could not be performed. However, we believe that the results remain valid since important objective outcomes such as RV and FEV1 demonstrated  successful  and  meaningful  effectiveness\nout to 12 months with an acceptable safety profile. In addition, the changes in subjective endpoints were consistent with those of objective outcomes.",
