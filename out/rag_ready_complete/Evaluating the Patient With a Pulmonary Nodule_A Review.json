The term dominant refers to the largest or the most suspicious-appearing nodule. This review does not discuss management of pulmonary nodules in patients with\nknown malignancy, patients with multiple pulmonary nodules without a dominant pulmonary nodule, or patients with a pulmonary mass, defined as a lung opacity with a diameter greater than 3 cm. The management approach to these individuals differs from that of an individual with a dominant pulmonary nodule, and pulmonary masses have a high probability of malignancy. This review describes current evidence regarding the optimal methods to establish the diagnosis of a dominant pulmonary nodule that may be due to primary lung malignancy, metastatic disease, a noninfectious inflammatory process, infection, or scar residual from a prior infection.\nThis review describes the epidemiology of pulmonary nodules and current evidence-based approaches to treatment of an\nIMPORTANCE Pulmonary nodules are identified in approximately 1.6 million patients per year in the US and are detected on approximately 30% of computed tomographic (CT) images of the chest.

      "content": "Approximately 95% of all pulmonary nodules identified on CT scans are benign. 1 The prevalence of pulmonary nodules in highrisk populations, such as those who are eligible for LDCT screening (ie, those aged 50-80 years with ≥ 20 pack-years' smoking history who have smoked within the past 15 years), 3 those with a cancer history, family history of lung cancer, or another significant risk factor (ie, asbestos exposure), has varied, in part based on the size threshold used to define a nodule. In a Veterans Health Administration lung cancer screening implementation study that included any size pulmonary nodule in the definition of a positive finding, 1257 of 2106 screened individuals (59.7%) had a pulmonary nodule. 4 In the National Lung Screening Trial, nodules 4 mm or larger were identified in 27.3% (7191 of 26 309) of baseline LDCT scans. 5 Among 24604 patients undergoing a second LDCT screening test (12 months after the baseline CT), 644 (2.6%) were identified as having a new nodule since the prior screening CT scan. 6 In the NELSON trial of 6309 patients undergoing screening for lung cancer, 147 patients (2.3%) had a nodule identified during baseline screening that grew at a concerning pace measured 3 months later, defined as a volume doubling time of less than 400 days. 7 In 2 studies of screening chest x-rays involving 103 500 participants, a pulmonary nodule was identified in 7.8% to 8.9% of the chest x-rays. 8,9 Imaging of the neck, abdomen, and heart can also identify pulmonary nodules. Of 1000 CT angiograms performed as a diagnostic test for pulmonary embo-\nlism in an emergency department, 99 (9.9%) had nodules that required follow-up. 10\nThe incidence of a pulmonary nodule increases with age, from 0.4 per 1000 person-years in people aged 18 to 24 years to 20.3 per 1000 person-years in those aged 85 to 89 years. In part, this increase is explained by the increase in chest CT imaging that occurs with age. The incidence of a pulmonary nodule is slightly higher in women (5.8 per 1000 person-years) than in men (5.2 per 1000 person-years) overall; however, for those older than 70 years, the incidence is higher in men. 1 In lung cancer screening trials, the rate of identifying a pulmonary nodule on baseline LDCT was similar in men (27.0%) and women (27.8%). 9 In chest x-rays, the rate of identifying a pulmonary nodule was slightly higher in men than women (9.6%-9.8% vs 8.2%-8.3%). 8,9 Rates of nodule identification on LDCT also increase with age. For example, in a study of 26 309 people aged 55 to 74 years who received an LDCT, the prevalence of pulmonary nodules was 24.3% in those aged 55 to 59 years and 34.0% in those aged 70 to 74 years. 9 In this study, the prevalence of pulmonary nodules was 23.2% in individuals with 30 to 35 pack-year smoking histories and 30.3% in those with more than 50 pack-years' smoking histories. 8,9 Although the rate of identification of pulmonary nodules on chest x-ray is much lower than on chest CT scan, similar trends in the prevalence of pulmonary nodules were observed in those screened with chest x-ray (8.0% in those who never smoked, 9.5% in those who previously smoked, 11.0% in those who currently smoke). 8,9\nThe frequency of identifying pulmonary nodules is particularly high in individuals undergoing imaging for evaluation of a known extrapulmonary malignancy, reaching 75% (233 of 308) of patients in 1 study. 11 Other factors associated with a higher risk of a pulmonary nodule in a cohort of 26 004 individuals undergoing a baseline LDCT included a history of hard-rock mining (35.0% vs 27.3%; odds ratio [Odds ratio (OR)], 1.40 [95% CI, 1.04-1.89]), White race (28.0% vs 20.6%; Odds ratio (OR), 1.39 [95% CI, 1.25-1.55]), residence in an area endemic for Histoplasma such as the Ohio River Valley (Odds ratio (OR), 1.30 [95% CI, 1.21-1.40]; calculated absolute rates: 32.5% vs 26.4%), farm work (Odds ratio (OR), 1.13 [95% CI, 1.03-1.23]; calculated absolute rates: 30.2% vs 27.1%), and a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Odds ratio (OR), 1.08 [95% CI, 1.01-1.17], calculated absolute rates: 30.1% vs 26.8%). 12",

This may include abdominal imaging if the nodule is at the base of the lungs, head and neck imaging if the nodule is in the upper lung zones, or cardiac imaging. It is not necessary to perform a diagnostic CT of the entire chest if a low-risk pulmonary nodule is first noted on a different type of CT scan.

In addition, a perifissural nodule, consisting of a smooth, well-circumscribed nodule adjacent to a lung fissure, most likely represents a lymph node and does not require subsequent monitoring with CT scans (Figure, B). 13 Satellite nodules, defined as small solid nodules surrounding a larger nodule, with nearby adenopathy may suggest a granulomatous infection (Figure, C).

Practice guidelines may not apply to patients for whom the risk of malignancy differs from the general population.

The probability of malignancy in an individual with lung cancer risk factors who has a 7-mm pulmonary nodule with concerning imaging features (ie, irregular or spiculated edges, upper lobe location) may approach 10%.\n18 F-fludeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDGPET) imaging, bronchoscopy, and transthoracic needle biopsy are unlikely to help identify malignancy in individuals with small solid pulmonary nodules. Nodules smaller than 8 mm in diameter are below the spatial resolution of FDG-PET imaging and are difficult to locate during bronchoscopic or transthoracic needle biopsy. For these reasons, individuals with pulmonary nodules smaller than 8 mm in diameter are usually monitored with serial chest CT imaging. The time interval between CT scans, performed to monitor changes in the nodule that could indicate malignancy, is based on the nodule size and the presence of risk factors for lung cancer. More recently published guidelines recommend longer intervals, such as 6 or 12 months, rather than 3 months, between monitoring scans. 14\nIn summary, available guidelines suggest that a nodule smaller than 6 mm should be monitored with a chest CT in 12 months in individuals with lung cancer risk factors such as a history of smoking or a family history of lung cancer. No additional CT imaging is required in those without lung cancer risk factors (Box 1). A nodule\nbetween 6 mm and 8 mm should be monitored with a chest CT in 6 months. Flexibility in these time intervals (eg, 3-6 months, 6-12 months) is included in the guidelines to accommodate nodule features other than size, as well as clinician and patient preferences.

For example, a risk calculator developed in a cohort of people with a pulmonary nodule presenting to a surgical clinic would not be as accurate when used to assess individuals with a pulmonary nodule identified during lung cancer screening. Thus, it is important to use a model that was derived from a population similar to the patient whose nodule is undergoing evaluation.

The choice between a CT-guided transthoracic needle biopsy and a guided bronchoscopy procedure is based on several factors, including location of the nodule, available clinical expertise, and patient comorbidities and values. A pulmonary nodule located in the periphery of the lung field is more likely to be accessible by transthoracic needle biopsy, while a pulmonary nodule located along the path of an airway may be more easily approached by bronchoscopy. In a meta-analysis, transthoracic needle biopsy had a higher pooled diagnostic yield (93% [95% CI, 90%-96%]) than bronchoscopy (75% [95% CI, 69%-80%]), but was associated with an increased risk for pneumothorax (26%) and hemorrhage (16%). 25 Advances in technologies that augment the ability to guide the bronchoscope to a peripheral nodule, confirm the location of the nodule, and provide representative samples of the nodule, including electromagnetic navigation, 26 radial endobronchial ultrasound, ultrathin bronchoscopes, 27 and roboticassisted bronchoscopy, 28 have substantially improved diagnostic yields of guided bronchoscopy while maintaining low complication rates. In a meta-analysis, the pooled sensitivity for malignancy of electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy was 77% (95% CI, 72%82%) with a 2.0% risk of pneumothorax (95% CI, 1.0%-3.0%) and 0.8% risk of major bleeding (95% CI, 0.5%-1.1%). 29 An added value of performing bronchoscopy is the ability to perform endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy of the hila and mediastinum if indicated for staging.\nWhen the probability of malignancy is high (eg, >70%), proceeding to surgical resection via a video or robotic-assisted approach is recommended in individuals without life-limiting comorbidities, such as severe emphysemaorsevereheartfailure,andwho meet criteria of cardiopulmonary fitness, such as predicted postoperativeforcedexpiratoryvolumein1secondanddiffusingcapacity greaterthan60%predicted,suggestingalowriskassociatedwith surgical resection. 30 Ideally, a surgical wedge resection to confirm thepresenceofcancer,obtainedduringanintraoperativefrozensection, can be followed by definitive treatment (eg, lobectomy or segmentectomy) during the same operation. For individuals with lifelimiting comorbidities and for those at high risk for complications fromsurgicalresection,otherpotentialnonsurgicaloptionsmayinclude nonsurgical biopsy (transthoracic needle biopsy and bronchoscopy),stereotacticradiotherapy,orotherablativetherapies.Feasibility of the biopsy, patient fitness, and patient preferences help inform this decision-making process.\nIndividualizing Care | In general, nodules can be classified into 1 of 3 categories of risk of malignancy and managed accordingly: those with a low risk (eg, <10%) can be monitored with imaging; those with an intermediate risk (eg, 10%-70% risk) should typically undergo additional diagnostic testing, and those with a high risk (eg, >70% risk) should proceed directly to surgery. These thresholds refer to the management of the population of patients with a pulmonary nodule and need to be considered in the context of other factors for individual patients. Two nodules with an identical\nprobability of malignancy may be managed differently. Factors that influence clinical decisions include the anticipated diagnostic yield of a nonsurgical biopsy, patient comorbidities that influence the safety of a procedure, the likelihood of benefit from establishing a diagnosis (life expectancy, nodule growth rate, metabolic activity), and patient values ( Box 2 ). It is important to note that after completion of all nonsurgical testing (ie, FDG/PET imaging, nonsurgical biopsy), in some patients the probability of malignancy may be higher than accepted thresholds for monitoring with imaging and lower than accepted thresholds for surgical resection. In this situation, the managing clinician and patient should discuss the tradeoffs of monitoring vs surgical resection to determine the most appropriate next step for that individual. It is also important to recognize that some cancers may grow slowly on serial imaging, providing the opportunity for the clinician and patient to discuss the preferred timing of treatment.",

In the series described above of 226 patients with subsolid pulmonary nodules, the solid component of a malignant part-solid nodule grew in 100% (17 of 17) of nodules within the first 3 years of monitoring, and in 86.4% (19 of 22) of malignant pure ground-glass nodules, but none of these cancers spread beyond the nodule during this follow-up period. 35 The metabolic activity of a malignant subsolid pulmonary nodule is relatively low (positive FDG-PET scan in 60%) 37 and the yield of transthoracic needle biopsies is also relatively low (51.2%). 37,38 These findings suggest that longer periods of imaging surveillance may be appropriate when following up patients with pure ground-glass nodules, particularly in people with advanced age or with comorbid conditions whose life expectancy is lower than in people who are younger or without comorbid conditions.\nIn summary, current guidelines suggest a pure ground-glass nodule smaller than 6 mm in diameter does not require additional testing or monitoring, but patients and clinicians may decide\nto perform additional testing or monitoring in selected situations. A ground-glass nodule 6 mm or larger can be followed with a chest CT in 6 to 12 months followed by every 2 years for 5 years if it remains stable. The management of a part-solid nodule should be based on the size of the solid component. Surveillance with a chest CT should occur in 6 months if the solid component is smaller than 6 mm or in 3 months if the solid component is 6 mm to 8 mm. Management of a part-solid nodule in which the solid component is 8 mm or larger should follow the recommended guidance for large solid nodules. 16,17 When monitoring a subsolid pulmonary nodule, the development or growth of a solid component of the nodule is a concerning finding that should lead to more frequent surveillance imaging, nonsurgical biopsy, or surgical resection based on the size of the solid component of the nodule. Growth of the ground-glass component alone does not suggest a malignancy has become invasive and thus does not require more intensive or invasive management. FDG-PET imaging is not useful for evaluating the probability of malignancy unless a solid component of at least 8 mm is present. Minimally invasive sublobar resection may be considered without biopsy when the size of the solid component of a subsolid lung nodule is growing and is 8 mm or larger ( Table 3 and Box 1). 14-16",

      "content": "Several societies have developed guidelines to assist with the evaluation of an individual with a pulmonary nodule. 14-16,31-33 These guidelines vary in their scope and focus, and some are specific to certain geographic regions and health systems. 32,33 Some of these guidelines focus on management of a small incidentally detected pulmonary nodule, others focus on management of an LDCT screen-detected pulmonary nodule, and some focus on both types of nodules. However, all the guidelines are organized based on an estimate of the probability that a pulmonary nodule is malignant, knowledge of the risk of malignancy in nodules of different densities, and workup for further assessment of the nodule. Differences in guideline recommendations include the use of different thresholds for the probability of malignancy to provide management recommendations (eg, <5%, 10%, or 15% probability for monitoring for nodule growth, 5%-15% to 65%-70% for additional nonsurgical evaluation, and >65% or >70% for surgical resection), the frequency and duration of image-based monitoring, the preferred risk calculators for identifying likelihood of malignancy, and whether volumetric imaging with growth rate calculation is recommended.\nGuideline recommendations have changed over time, based on a better understanding of probability of malignancy and growth patterns of malignant pulmonary nodules. Changes have included using a higher threshold for probability of malignancy, compared with past guidelines, for use of imaging to monitor growth of a nodule (eg, <15% probability currently compared with <5% probability in the past), monitoring less frequently and for shorter durations, and allowing more flexibility in frequency of diagnostic testing, to accommodate consideration of patient risk factors, comorbidities, and values. These guidelines refer to an incidentally or screendetected pulmonary nodule and not a pulmonary nodule in an individual with a known malignancy for whom metastatic disease is a concern (Box 1). Pulmonary nodule guideline recommendations are summarized in Table 1 and Table 3.\nCompliance of clinicians with guideline recommendations and patients' actual follow-up in practice may be suboptimal.
