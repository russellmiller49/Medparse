To date, there have been no prospective studies of the effectiveness of inhaled TA for the treatment of hemoptysis.\nOBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to prospectively assess the effectiveness of TA inhalations (ie, nebulized TA) for hemoptysis treatment.\nMETHODS: This analysis was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of treatment with nebulized TA (500 mg tid) vs placebo (normal saline) in patients admitted with hemoptysis of various etiologies. Patients with massive hemoptysis (expectorated blood > 200 mL/24 h) and hemodynamic or respiratory instability were excluded. Mortality and hemoptysis recurrence rate were assessed at 30 days and following 1 year.\nRESULTS: Forty-seven patients were randomized to receive TA inhalations (n ¼ 25) or normal saline (n ¼ 22). TA was associated with a signiﬁcantly reduced expectorated blood volume starting from day 2 of admission. Resolution of hemoptysis within 5 days of admission was observed in more TA-treated patients than in those receiving placebo (96% vs 50%; P < .0005). Mean hospital length of stay was shorter for the TA group (5.7 2.5 days vs 7.8 4.6 days; P ¼ .046), with fewer patients requiring invasive procedures such as interventional bronchoscopy or angiographic embolization to control the bleeding (0% vs 18.2%; P ¼ .041). No side effects were noted in either group throughout the follow-up period. In addition, a reduced recurrence rate was noted at the 1-year follow-up (P ¼ .009).\nCONCLUSIONS: TA inhalations can be used safely and effectively to control bleeding in patients with nonmassive hemoptysis.",

The severity of hemoptysis can also vary, ranging from minimal blood-streaked sputum to immediate life-threatening hemorrhage. Effective management of signi /uniFB01 cant hemoptysis includes several interventional procedures, consisting of angiographic bronchial artery embolization and various endobronchial interventions to control bleeding. 1 However, there is no effective medical therapy for hemoptysis, other than treatment of the speci /uniFB01 c cause (eg, antibiotics for infection).\nTranexamic acid (TA) is a synthetic lysine analogue with anti /uniFB01 brinolytic activity manifested by inhibiting the activation of plasminogen to plasmin and by blocking\nthe action of plasmin on /uniFB01 brin. 2,3 Systemic administration of TA may reduce surgical blood loss, improve abnormal uterine bleeding, and control traumatic hemorrhage (as reviewed elsewhere 2,3 ). Topical application of TA is also effective in reducing surgical blood loss and the need for blood transfusions. 4\nNebulized TA was described as a treatment for hemoptysis in several case reports and in a small case series 1 but has not, to the best of our knowledge, ever been assessed in a formal study. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of TA in patients admitted with hemoptysis in a prospective, doubleblinded, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial (RCT).",

      "content": "The present study compared nebulized TA with placebo for the treatment of hemoptysis; TA was associated with higher rates of hemoptysis resolution and a quicker decrease in the amount of bleeding starting from the second day of therapy. No adverse effects of treatment were noted in either group. The advantages of TA therapy translated into clinical bene /uniFB01 ts of a shorter hospitalization term and a reduced need for interventional procedures to control bleeding.\nThe causes of hemoptysis in this study were diverse and mostly comprised bronchiectasis, respiratory infections, and malignancy. These results are in accordance with contemporary studies of the causes of hemoptysis in areas with a low prevalence of TB. 6-8 In a retrospective nationwide study from France, no etiology was identi /uniFB01 able for one half of patients admitted for episodes of hemoptysis, which were initially considered cryptogenic. 8 However, a speci /uniFB01 c diagnosis, mostly lung cancer, was subsequently identi /uniFB01 ed in a signi /uniFB01 cant proportion of these patients, again corresponding to similar reports. In addition, the tendency of patients in the present study to be elderly male subjects who smoked is consistent with previous publications; in the present study, however, patients were on the average older than those of the previous reports. 6-8 More than one half of the patients in our study were treated with antiplatelet drugs or anticoagulation on admission. Because pulmonary infections such as bronchitis could be a major cause for hemoptysis in smokers, 9 and nearly one third of the study patients were presenting with bronchiectasis, most patients were treated with antibiotics during admission. These /uniFB01 ndings also match the present situation in developed countries. Thus, this\nThe c 2 test for cause of bleeding was P ¼ .2.\n]\nstudy population seems to well represent current conditions in regions not endemic for TB, which may make our /uniFB01 ndings generalized. The average LOS for the placebo group was 7.8 days, which was similar to previously reported studies describing mild to moderate bleeding. 6\nAlthough TA is commonly used to control bleeding in various scenarios, its use in patients with hemoptysis has not been thoroughly investigated. Two review articles evaluated the effectiveness of TA in patients with hemoptysis. The Cochrane review 11 included two RCTs that included systemic TA administration (orally 10 or intravenously 12 ) to patients with hemoptysis. Pooled results revealed a signi /uniFB01 cant reduction in bleeding time in patients treated with TA, compared with placebo, although had no effect on remission of hemoptysis. No side effects were noted. The authors concluded that evidence to judge whether anti /uniFB01 brinolytic agents should be used to treat hemoptysis from any cause remains insuf /uniFB01 cient. A different review by Moen et al 13 assessed studies describing various forms, dosages, and length of treatments with TA in patients with different etiologies for hemoptysis; in addition to previous RCTs, it included observational studies, case series, and case reports. The authors concluded that TA may reduce the duration and volume of bleeding, with a low risk for side\neffects, but they were reluctant to give strong recommendations.\nFollowing the aforementioned reviews, Bellam et al 14 published another RCT describing patients with submassive hemoptysis who were randomized to receive IV TA or placebo. The severity of hemoptysis decreased in patients treated with TA, with no adverse effects. The authors suggested that TA can be used as a bridging therapy until de /uniFB01 nitive measures to control the bleeding are undertaken.\nPublications regarding nebulized TA treatment, however, were limited to case reports or case series, mostly including patients with advanced malignancies. Nevertheless, in these publications, nebulized TA was found to be highly effective in controlling the bleeding, although results may have been skewed because of publication bias. 15-17\nThe inhaled form of administration was shown to be faster and more effective than systemically administered medications in various conditions such as lung cancer. 18 Inhaled aerosolized medications are routinely used for various chronic lung diseases such as Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, and bronchiectasis, and were shown to offer several advantages over the systemically administered medications. These include more rapid onset of action\nDays\n10\nLOS\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\nPlacebo\nTA\n*\nB\nfor drugs such as b -adrenergic agonists compared with oral medication, high luminal doses for inhaled antibiotics when used to treat endobronchial infection, and an improved therapeutic index compared with systemic delivery for other classes of drugs such as corticosteroids. 19-21 Based on these data, we assumed that the inhaled TA would be at least as effective topically as it was systemically. In addition, we also assumed that side effects such as thrombosis were more likely to occur in the IV form and not in the inhalation type of administration.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this study is the /uniFB01 rst prospective RCT to assess the effect of nebulized TA in patients admitted with hemoptysis, and as such, it /uniFB01\ncontributes signi cantly to the current data.\nNonetheless, our study has several limitations. Patients with massive hemoptysis were excluded, as these individuals require emergent interventions to control\nbleeding. The small number of participants does not allow speci /uniFB01 c assessment of TA in different scenarios of hemoptysis, such as anticoagulant therapy or varying etiologies. However, as mentioned earlier, the wide inclusion criteria and apparently representative participants seem to lead to generalized results. In addition, the fact that positive effects of nebulized TA were consistent in different measured outcomes, including not only the volume of expectorated blood but also clinical outcomes of hospital LOS and requirements for intervention, supports the ef /uniFB01 ciency of this therapy.",
