    "abstract": "This BTS guideline updates evidence-based recommendations for adult diagnostic flexible bronchoscopy (FB), covering monitoring, complications, sedation/topical anesthesia, infection control, staffing, and key diagnostic procedures. It emphasizes continuous monitoring (pulse oximetry for all; ECG when at higher cardiac risk) and targeted oxygen supplementation during significant, sustained desaturation. Scope includes FB in special populations (e.g., ICU), diagnostic yield targets (e.g., visible endobronchial tumor), and patient-safety processes, while excluding training and advanced therapeutic techniques. Keywords: flexible bronchoscopy, monitoring, sedation, safety, diagnostic yield, guideline.",

Lidocaine toxicity is conventionally accepted to be likely above serum concentrations of 5 m g/mL, although studies suggest that subjective side effects may occur at much lower serum concentrations;\nFrey et al 141 studied 154 patients who received a mean dose of 15.4 mg/kg lidocaine (including nebulised lidocaine and nasal gel lidocaine). A total of 62% of patients had euphoria or dizziness (subjective signs of toxicity) despite only one patient having serum concentration >5 m g/mL.\nMartin et al 142 studied 39 volunteer healthcare workers having unsedated bronchoscopy who received a median dose of 9.6 mg/kg lidocaine (including nebulised and nasal gel lidocaine). A total of 92% had subjective side effects.\nOther studies failed to demonstrate side effects with average lidocaine doses of 7.1 -9.3 mg/kg. 137 139 140 142 However, these data should be interpreted with caution given signi /uniFB01 cant interpatient variability between dose administered and serum concentration ( partly due to unpredictable absorption at different parts of the respiratory tract), with serum concentrations >5 m g/mL occasionally seen even for lower doses of administered lidocaine. 137 140 142 143 Given randomised studies suggesting that a low cough score is achievable with a total lidocaine\ndose of less than 160 mg, 118 135 bronchoscopists should strive to use the lowest dose of lidocaine possible, while still ensuring good bronchoscopic conditions and patient comfort.\nWhile lidocaine absorption varies throughout the respiratory tract, bronchoscopists should assess and record the total lidocaine dose administered during bronchoscopy (including nasal, oropharyngeal, laryngeal and tracheobronchial lidocaine).

The diagnostic yield from bronchoscopy depends on whether the tumour is visible within the bronchial tree. Many studies have demonstrated the sensitivity of bronchial biopsy with forceps, which ranges from 48% to 93% (American College of Chest Physicians guidelines 2007, table 2). 145\nStudies have shown that the addition of bronchial brush specimens and washings increases the diagnostic yield of bronchoscopy in patients with lung cancer. The systematic review and meta-analysis carried out by the American College of Chest Physicians 145 identi /uniFB01 ed 35 studies of patients with central disease undergoing bronchoscopy. The pooled data in 4507\npatients demonstrated an overall combined sensitivity of 88% for bronchoscopic techniques. Biopsy of visible lesions alone had a yield of 74% while washings had a sensitivity of 48% and yield from brushings was 59%. McLean et al 146 analysed 2238 bronchoscopies carried out between January 1991 and December 1992 in /uniFB01 ve centres in Scotland. When endobronchial tumour was seen, sensitivity for brushings and washings combined was 47%. The yield from biopsy alone was 82% and when combined with brushings and washings the yield increased to 87%. When the tumour was not visible the sensitivity of brushings and washings combined was 9%. 146\nThe optimal number of bronchial biopsy specimens in cases of visible endobronchial tumour has also been studied., Gellert 147 demonstrated that at least /uniFB01 ve samples are required to achieve a 90% probability of a positive malignant biopsy for a visible tumour. 147 Popovich et al 148 demonstrated in peripheral lung cancer lesions biopsied using TBLB that only a 45% diagnostic yield was achieved with one biopsy and in some cases the diagnosis was not achieved before the /uniFB01 fth or sixth biopsy. They suggested that up to 10 biopsies may be required.\nBased on recent evidence, it is reasonable to expect a diagnostic yield of 85% when the tumour is visible at bronchoscopy using bronchial biopsy. 149 150 Slade et al 149 examined the diagnostic yield from FB at a single centre between 2001 and 2007. In patients with tumour visible at bronchoscopy, the yield increased from 75% in 2001 to 94.5% in 2007.\nThe management of patients with advanced Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) now depends on the phenotyping and genotyping of lung cancer. 151 However, the currently available evidence does not clarify whether this is routinely possible with bronchoscopic samples and in particular whether bronchial brushings and washings are suitable for subclassi /uniFB01 cation of Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Studies of the sequence of biopsies, brushings and washings suggest that the order of sample acquisition is not important. 152 However, to maximise the volume of tissue to allow the phenotyping and genotyping of advanced Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), bronchial brushings and washings may be taken after suf /uniFB01 cient biopsy specimens have been taken.\nIn addition to providing pathological information, bronchoscopy enables the location and extent of an endobronchial lesion to be determined. Careful assessment of the vocal cords is mandatory, since the presence of vocal cord palsy may provide evidence of mediastinal invasion (and thus inoperability). Bronchoscopy also allows for accurate assessment of the location and therefore T staging of an endobronchial tumour which may have implications for surgical treatment.\nRecommendations for FB in performing conventional TBNA and endobronchial ultrasound (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)) TBNA as a diagnostic technique for lung cancer are discussed in the BTS guideline for advanced diagnostic and therapeutic FB in adults, which also includes a guide on how to perform TBNA. 3",

      "content": "Bronchoscopy is a useful diagnostic tool in some ILDs, particularly sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis and organising pneumonia. 153 BAL and TBLB are frequently performed in suspected cases of ILD.\nTBLB is a technique which uses biopsy forceps to obtain alveolar tissue; it is particularly useful in obtaining histological specimens for suspected cases of ILD, although crush artefact during the procedure may render the samples inadequate for histological diagnosis, particularly in idiopathic pulmonary /uniFB01 brosis. The size of forceps used does not appear to affect the diagnostic yield (see appendix 10 for a step-by-step guide on how to perform TBLB). 153 A retrospective review of 452 bronchoscopies in localised and diffuse lesions examined by TBLB demonstrated a diagnostic yield in 55.2% of patients with a localised lesion and 67% in those with diffuse lesions. The study also demonstrated an increase in the diagnostic yield with an increasing number of specimens, so that taking more than four biopsies increased the yield from 52% to more than 70%. 43 The complication rate in this series was 6%; 5.8% developed a pneumothorax (3.8% required intercostal drainage) and signi /uniFB01 cant bleeding was noted in 0.2%, suggesting that TBLB is a useful diagnostic procedure with a low complication rate 43\nThe use of BAL may be controversial, since its use in diagnosis and monitoring disease activity is limited in ILD, and its current strength is in research in understanding the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms in ILD. 154 There is a suggestion that combining techniques increases diagnostic yield. In a study investigating patients with sarcoidosis, TBLB alone was diagnostic in 58%, TBNA alone was successful in diagnosing 17% of cases as was BAL alone; combining all three procedures led to a 100% diagnostic rate. 155\nNo evidence currently exists for the coexistent use of BAL with TBLB, however it is reasonable to perform both these procedures in cases of suspected ILD. BAL and TBLB should be performed in areas shown to be affected on high-resolution CT (HRCT) 156 and both procedures should be performed on the same lung. In those with typical HRCT features of idiopathic pulmonary /uniFB01 brosis, BAL and TBLB are not required for diagnosis.\nDiagnostic bronchoscopic procedures have moderate (67 -74%) diagnostic sensitivity in patients with diffuse ILD, 157 158 but have high diagnostic sensitivity in cases of sarcoidosis. In a study of 530 consecutive TBLBs in patients with diffuse in /uniFB01 ltrates, the overall diagnostic yield was 50% and 75% for stage II -III sarcoidosis. The diagnostic yield of hypersensitivity pneumonitis in this series was 92%. In a case series of 183 patients with bilateral diffuse shadowing, Mitchell et al 159 demonstrated that TBLB had a diagnostic yield of 77% for patients with sarcoidosis.\nThe diagnostic sensitivity of TBLB and BAL in sarcoidosis is estimated to be between 56% and 77%, increasing with the severity of the disease. 157 159 -164 One study demonstrated the sensitivity of TBLB to be 55% in stage I disease, 80% in stage II\ndisease and 82% in stage III disease. 162 In sarcoidosis, EBB may also prove useful, even without visible endobronchial abnormality , particularly when parenchymal disease exists. 163 Combining techniques will improve diagnostic yield. 160 161 Mediastinal lymphadenopathy can be sampled by conventional or ultrasound guided TBNA -please refer to the BTS guideline for advanced diagnostic and therapeutic FB in adults for speci /uniFB01 c recommendations and evidence. 3\nA minimum of /uniFB01 ve to six TBLB samples should be taken and increasing the number of samples will increase the diagnostic yield, particularly in those with a localised lesion. 164 A direct correlation has been shown between the number of TBLBs taken and diagnostic yield, with a 35% diagnostic yield for one to three biopsies, increasing to 69% with 6 -10 biopsies. 164 Furthermore, Popovich et al 148 demonstrated in peripheral lung cancer lesions biopsied using TBLB that only a 45% diagnostic yield was achieved with one biopsy and in some cases the diagnosis was not achieved before the /uniFB01 fth or sixth biopsy. They suggested that up to 10 biopsies may be required.\nThere is con /uniFB02 icting evidence regarding the use of /uniFB02 uoroscopy during TBLB. A retrospective review by Anders et al of 112 TBLBs performed with /uniFB02 uoroscopy and 135 without /uniFB02 uoroscopy found no signi /uniFB01 cant difference in the yield (72.3% vs 67.4%); however the yield for localised lesions was lower without /uniFB02 uoroscopy. 165 Fluoroscopy may be useful when performing TBLB on localised peripheral lesions. The diagnostic rate of TBLB without /uniFB02 uoroscopy varies between 60% and 65%, 159 166 and with /uniFB02 uoroscopy 55.2 -73% 43 165 for localised lesions. It has therefore been suggested that /uniFB02 uoroscopy may be useful when performing TBLB on localised peripheral lesions. Two studies have demonstrated that knowledge of the location of the lesion from chest radiograph aids diagnostic yield. To ensure that peripheral localised lesions are being accessed correctly , /uniFB02 uoroscopy may therefore be required. 43 167 The incidence of pneumothorax following TBLB without /uniFB02 uoroscopy is between 3% and 5%, 166 168 although one study demonstrated no increase in the incidence of pneumothoraces (0.015%). 157 A chest x-ray may be performed immediately if pneumothorax is suspected or the patient is symptomatic, or be done at least 2 h after TBLB to exclude pneumothorax. 47",

The internal diameter of the\nET may restrict the size of the bronchoscope, while ef /uniFB01 cient suctioning requires a larger bronchoscope with a wide suction channel. The internal diameter of the tracheal tube relative to the external diameter of the bronchoscope is an important consideration. Bronchoscopes in the non-intubated patient occupy only 10 -15% of the cross-sectional area of the trachea. In contrast, a 5.7 mm bronchoscope occupies 40% of a 9 mm ET and 66% of a 7 mm tracheal tube. Failure to recognise this may lead to inadequate ventilation of the patient and impaction of or damage to the bronchoscope.\nLubrication is essential to facilitate passage of the bronchoscope. Tracheostomy tubes are prone to damage the bronchoscope, particularly during withdrawal when the rigid edge of the end of the tracheostomy tube can abrade the covering of the bronchoscope.\nA single model (non-human) study addresses the issue of airway support device and size of bronchoscope. 225 In this study, the laryngeal mask airway (LMA), reinforced LMA (RLMA) and ET were assessed in a simulated model of ventilation, measuring /uniFB02 ow resistance during simulated inspiration and the maximum size of /uniFB02 exible bronchoscope (using oesophageal dilators to mimic six different sizes of bronchoscope (2.7 -8.9 mm external diameter)).

Removal of the LMA aperture bars resulted in a mean decrease in /uniFB02 ow resistance of 3.6%.

This results in a wide range of reported sensitivities of bronchoscopic techniques (51 -100%), and variable comparison to non-invasive techniques. Overall, bronchoscopy and lavage or brushing appears to be safe for microbiological diagnosis in ventilated patients.\nAwell conducted systematic review conducted in 2008 258 and then repeated in 2012 259 included /uniFB01 ve randomised trials (totalling 1367 patients) which assessed the utility of invasive (bronchoscopic) versus non-invasive (blind catheter brush and other blind techniques) in reducing mortality and ICU stay in ventilated patients with clinically diagnosed ventilator-associated pneumonia. Comparing quantitative and qualitative cultures (1240 patients), there were no statistically signi /uniFB01 cant differences in mortality rates (Relative risk (RR)=0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.11).

As bronchoscopic techniques are more invasive with no demonstrated bene /uniFB01 t over less invasive techniques, this evidence suggests bronchoscopy should not be used in preference to non-invasive diagnostic strategies. However, when non-invasive diagnostic strategies are not available, bronchoscopy to con /uniFB01 rm diagnosis may be a reasonable option, although there is no direct evidence to address this issue.\nThe evidence above does not address the issue of diagnosis of non-ventilator-associated pneumonia in ventilated patients (eg, patients with community-acquired pneumonia who subsequently require ventilation).",

One hundred percent oxygen should be given during bronchoscopy and in the immediate recovery period. The ventilator should be adjusted to a mandatory setting. T riggered modes such as pressure support or assist control will not reliably maintain ventilation during bronchoscopy. The ventilator pressure limit should be increased to ensure that adequate tidal volumes are delivered during each respiratory cycle and the ventilator rate increased if necessary. Most modern microprocessor-controlled ventilators will monitor tidal volume and minute ventilation.\nA special swivel connector (Portex, Hythe, UK) with a perforated diaphragm, through which the bronchoscope can be inserted, allows continued ventilation and maintenance of (positive end-expiratory pressure PEEP)/CPAP . This is particularly important when performing a bronchoscopy in patients with hypoxia (eg, Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)) when maintenance of PEEP is important.\nThere is a small case series in normal human volunteers 272 and a single study conducted in a dog model and six healthy human volunteers 273 in support of the use of jet ventilation via the bronchoscope in ventilated patients. An 11-patient case series in healthy volunteers is in support of the use of highfrequency positive pressure ventilation during bronchoscopy. 274 These techniques may be useful during bronchoscopy in the ICU, but more robust comparative studies are needed to quantify any potential bene /uniFB01 t.\nA total of three case series (totalling 46 patients) 24 275 276 suggest non-invasive ventilation via mask or helmet may be helpful in preventing progression to mechanical ventilation in non-ventilated patients with hypoxia undergoing bronchoscopy, but further studies are needed in this area. A small (n=30) but well conducted randomised trial suggests CPAP plus oxygen is superior to oxygen alone during bronchoscopy of patients with hypoxia, preventing reduction in saturations and the need for ventilator support post procedure. 268 A single case series of 40 patients assessed those requiring non-invasive ventilation for respiratory failure prior to a decision to conduct bronchoscopy. 277 In these patients, 4/40 (10%) required mechanical ventilation within 8 h. Within 48 h, 45% were intubated, and in total 55% required intubation (median time from bronchoscopy to intubation=27 h). This implies that patients requiring noninvasive ventilator support prior to bronchoscopy should be considered high risk for requiring intubation post procedure, and that the procedure should therefore be conducted by an experienced operator in a setting where intubation and ventilation can occur.\nMonitoring intracranial pressure (ICP) in patients with a head injury is essential if sudden rises in ICP are to be avoided due to CO2 retention or other causes. Monitoring endotracheal CO2 in such patients may also help to detect falls in minute ventilation caused by the presence of the bronchoscope within the ET. Profound anaesthesia, including effective neuromuscular blockade, is often used in patients with head injury while undergoing bronchoscopy. Four studies (one randomised controlled trial 270 and three others 278 -280 ) addressing this issue have consistently demonstrated that bronchoscopy raises ICP . A small but well conducted randomised study assessing hyperventilation via the ventilator during bronchoscopy demonstrated no difference in peak ICP , 270 but suggested hyperventilation may accelerate return to baseline\nICP after bronchoscopy in patients with closed head injury. The signi /uniFB01 cance of this treatment effect on clinically important recovery is unknown. Three small non-randomised studies suggest that while ICP is signi /uniFB01 cantly raised during bronchoscopy , cerebral perfusion pressure is probably maintained. 278 -280",

Synthetic narcotics such as alfentanil or fentanyl will suppress cough and provide profound analgesia. Sedation can be induced using incremental doses of a benzodiazepine or propofol.

In such cases bronchoscopy can be undertaken with supplemental topical anaesthesia with lignocaine injected through the bronchoscope. However, care must be exercised in patients with combinations of renal failure, liver dysfunction and congestive heart failure when accumulation of lignocaine may be associated with side effects ( please see section on ' Tpoical anaesthesia ' ).\nOne case series of 104 patients undergoing bronchoscopy during mechanical ventilation indirectly addressed the issue of sedation level during bronchoscopy. 271 The primary purpose of the study was to assess gas exchange differences before and after the procedure, however the study demonstrated signi /uniFB01 cant falls in oxygenation (PaO2 < 60 mm Hg with FiO2 = 0.8) in 14 patients, and this fall was independently associated in multivariate analysis with the presence of Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and a clinician ' s observation of the patient ' /uniFB01 ghting the ventilator ' .

Although bronchoscopy carries a low risk of infection it is essential that all stages of the decontamination process are conducted correctly.\nSince the last bronchoscopy guidelines were published in 2001 2 the body of new evidence relating to decontamination of bronchoscopes is very limited (eight articles). Many of the recommendations are based on expert opinion.\nMost bronchoscopy procedures are carried out in endoscopy units where British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidelines on decontamination are followed. 281 These guidelines were reviewed in 2008 282 ; the recommendations made by BSG equally apply to bronchoscopes.\nThe NHS National Endoscopy Programme document ' Decontamination standards for /uniFB02 exible endoscopes 2008 ' , 283 which was produced following the introduction of the Joint Advisory Group on Gastrointestinal Endoscopy accreditation, looks at safety and quality issues. This document may be considered as a basis for departmental policy. Guidelines from the Medical Devices Agency (MDA) are also available. 284 A cleaning and disinfecting procedure can be found in appendix 12 of this guideline.\nMany of the problems identi /uniFB01 ed in the literature suggest that lack of training and poor adherence to decontamination procedures are the main cause of infection/pseudo infection. An MDA alert published in 2004 highlighted concerns with inadequate decontamination, including that of auxiliary channels. 285 The Health Act 2006 stipulates the roles of decontamination leads, the need for training programmes and monitoring systems. 286 Newer bronchoscopes, such as endobronchial ultrasound scopes, have extra channels, and therefore it is essential that all staff are aware of the con /uniFB01 guration of all scopes and decontamination processes.",

      "content": "FB is necessary for the diagnosis and endobronchial treatment of respiratory disease. Many patients are fearful of the procedure and experience anxiety prior to and discomfort during the bronchoscopy, irrespective of sedation and analgesia. 290 291 Increasingly emphasis is placed on patient satisfaction as an outcome measure for bronchoscopy, along with the diagnostic and therapeutic value of the procedure. 292\nPatient satisfaction is complex and in /uniFB02 uenced by multiple factors, measured in varied ways, and needs to be interpreted in the context of the speci /uniFB01 c procedure evaluated. Multiple factors appear to in /uniFB02 uence patient satisfaction when assessed for FB. Patient characteristics, previous healthcare experience, expectations, the procedure and post-procedure care all play a role in determining how satis /uniFB01 ed a patient is following a FB. Patient ' s willingness to return for another bronchoscopy, 292 visual analogue scoring (VAS) systems, adherence to post-procedure instructions and recorded numbers of complaints and medical\nnegligence claims are mentioned as indicators of satisfaction in bronchoscopy.\nDetermining factors for patient satisfaction with bronchoscopy can be divided into patient characteristics, process or procedure factors and factors associated with the setting. Lechtzin et al 292 found that patients more willing to return for a repeat bronchoscopy had a better general health status, experienced less pain with bronchoscope insertion, rated the information given to them better and rated the quality of the bronchoscopist higher. Hirose et al 293 found that male gender, shorter examination time, more experienced bronchoscopist and less discomfort from coughing, pharyngeal pain and swallowing were associated with higher patient satisfaction. VAS for cough perception during a FB appear to correlate best with patient satisfaction in one study. 294 This study further demonstrates a positive correlation between VAS for satisfaction as reported by the bronchoscopist and the patient and the total number of coughs recorded during the procedure. Bernasconi et al reported the length of the procedure as an important determining factor for satisfaction, irrespective of procedures performed during the bronchoscopy. 295\nMany patients undergoing a bronchoscopy are fearful of a malignant diagnosis and are anxious prior to the procedure. The discomfort experienced by patients during bronchoscopy strongly correlates to anxiety before the procedure. 295 296 Adequate sedation reduces patient anxiety and improves tolerance and satisfaction with the procedure. 98 Detailed preprocedure information explaining ' how ' the procedure will be done and ' why ' it is indicated helps to reduce pre-procedure fear in patients 290 (appendix 13 provides an example of a patient information lea /uniFB02 et that is also available electronically on the BTS website).\nDistraction methods have been used to reduce patients ' levels of fear and anxiety prior to bronchoscopy. Distraction therapy with nature sounds and sights improved self-reported anxiety in a randomised trial done by Diette et al . 297 Two randomised trials using music to reduce stress in patients failed to demonstrate a difference in physiological responses during the procedure 298 or procedure-related anxiety state scores. 299\nThere is insuf /uniFB01 cient evidence to support a speci /uniFB01 c time for patients to starve prior to bronchoscopy. A Cochrane review and recent systematic review on fasting times for surgery found no evidence that participants given /uniFB02 uids 2 -3 h preoperatively were at an increased risk of aspiration/regurgitation. 300 301 The 2001 guideline recommended fasting time for solids of 4 h and clear /uniFB02 uids up to 2 h. 2 No new evidence was found of increased adverse events with this regime or evidence to support longer fasting times for FB.\nPatient satisfaction is complex and in /uniFB02 uenced by multiple factors; it is increasingly recognised that measuring the patient experience in a speci /uniFB01 c setting is important to improve and transform services. The Department of Health in the UK published a document on best practice in 2009 entitled ' Understanding what matters: a guide to using patient feedback to transform care ' . 302 In this document the importance of patient involvement in developing and changing healthcare services is emphasised. The process of collecting and reviewing patient experience feedback is important in how healthcare services are delivered. 302 The bene /uniFB01 ts of including patient feedback in review of FB services include:\n▸ improvement in communication between patients and staff;\n▸ building trust and con /uniFB01 dence in the healthcare provider and service;\n▸ informs planning and service improvement;\n▸ patient-centred, accessible and responsive services;\n▸ patients help to shape the services that they use.",

Giving and obtaining consent is usually a process, not a one-off event. Patients need time to read and understand the information provided before FB and should be given the opportunity to ask questions. Patients can change their minds and withdraw consent at any time. To proceed with bronchoscopy in the absence of appropriate consent may lead to legal proceedings for assault and battery. Failure to provide adequate information to a patient, including information about the potential risks and adverse outcomes of a procedure, may lead to a negligence action against the clinician. In the UK, the principles and guidance for obtaining informed consent is outlined by the General Medical Council in a document entitled ' Consent guidance: patients and doctors making decisions together ' . 303",

The exchange of information between the clinician and the patient is central to the process of informed consent and good decision-making. The amount of information shared with patients will vary, depending on their individual circumstances. The approach to discussions with patients should be tailored to:\n▸ the patient ' s individual needs, wishes and priorities;\n▸ the patient ' s unique level of understanding and knowledge of their condition, prognosis and the treatment options;\n▸ the nature of the condition that the bronchoscopy is indicated for;\n▸ the nature and level of risk associated with the proposed procedure.\nPatients should be given the opportunity to ask any questions and practitioners must answer all questions honesty and truthfully.

      "content": "FB is an essential, established and ever expanding tool in respiratory medicine. Its practice, however, needs to be safe, effective and for the right indications.\nThis guideline seeks to provide a detailed, evidence-based and practical overview of best practice in this /uniFB01 eld. Extensive literature has been published in the various aspects of bronchoscopy over the last three decades, and this document has been developed by carefully appraising all the available publications, applying a rigorous, standardised methodology, and summarising the wealth of data that are available.\nParticular emphasis has been placed on the safety aspects of bronchoscopy, such as patient monitoring, precautions in speci /uniFB01 c conditions, prevention and management of complications, adequate staf /uniFB01 ng, optimal sedation and disinfection. At the same time, the importance of continually auditing the practice of this indispensable technique, with the aim of achieving and maintaining the high diagnostic utility that it offers is outlined.\nThe primary objective of this guideline is to provide practitioners in the UK and beyond with a comprehensive guide to the technique of basic FB, using up-to-date information. For information on more advanced bronchoscopic procedures, this document is best read in conjunction with the BTS guideline for advanced diagnostic and therapeutic bronchoscopy, published in November 2011. 3",

Saline has the advantage that it may be administered repeatedly.\n4. If bleeding continues, the bronchoscope should be wedged into the bleeding segmental bronchus, if possible, and held in place for 10-15 minutes.\n5. If this does not control the bleeding, a balloon catheter can be used to apply pressure and isolate the segment.\n6. Check platelet count, PT and PTT , and recheck drug history.\n7.
