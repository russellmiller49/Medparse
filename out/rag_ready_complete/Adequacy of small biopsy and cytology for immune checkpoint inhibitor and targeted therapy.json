      "content": "In  recent  years,  advances  in  characterising  the genomic landscape of lung cancer, particularly nonsmall-  cell  lung  cancer  (Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)),  have  resulted  in significant progress in the development of effective targeted therapies. 1-3 The recent addition of testing for  T yrosine  protein  kinase  Met  ( MET )  exon  14 skipping mutation and Rearranged during Transfection  ( RET )  fusions  to  the  already  well-  established testing for epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR )  and serine/threonine protein kinase B-  Raf ( BRAF ) mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) and proto-  oncogene tyrosine protein kinase ROS  ( ROS1 )  rearrangements  has  increased  the number of 'must test' genes recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 4 In addition to biomarkers for targeted therapy,  the  development  of  immune  checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapies that use immune-  mediated destruction of tumour cells has led to United States Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  approvals of immunomodulatory monoclonal antibodies such  as  pembrolizumab,  nivolumab,  atezolizumab and  durvalumab  for  treatment  of  advanced-  stage Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 5 In contrast to therapy that targets specific molecules  in  signalling  pathways  involved  in  the growth  and  propagation  of  cancer  cells,  immunotherapy uses the host immune system to recognise  tumour  cells,  stimulate  the  immune  system, and relieve the suppression of antitumour activity. Current NCCN guidelines for advanced or metastatic  Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  therefore  recommend  programmed cell  death  ligand  1  (PD-  L1)  testing  to  evaluate eligibility for ICI, in addition to routine molecular profiling  for EGFR , BRAF , ALK , ROS1 , RET and MET exon  14  skipping  mutations. 4 In  addition, biomarkers such as neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase  ( NTRK )  have  been  included  in  the  NCCN guidelines,  since  the  FDA  has  approved  larotrectinib and entrectinib as first-  line therapy in NTRK fusion-  positive  patients  with  any  advanced-  stage solid  organ  malignancies.  Furthermore,  emerging markers  such  as  Erb-  B2  receptor  tyrosine  kinase\n( ERBB2 or HER2 ),  high  level MET amplification,  and  Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Viral Oncogene ( KRAS ) exon 2  p.G13C are likely to be included in the Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)-  targeted therapeutic armamentarium in the near future.\nAdvanced-  stage lung cancer is commonly diagnosed with the use of minimally invasive techniques such as core needle biopsy  (CNB)  and/or  fine-  needle  aspiration  (FNA).  For thoracic lesions, typically an endobronchial/transbronchial approach, which commonly uses ultrasound (US) guidance, or a transthoracic (percutaneous) approach, which uses CT or US guidance, is used to collect these 'small specimens'. 6 The  procedural  modality  of  choice  depends  on  multiple factors including the site/size of the lesion, skill and expertise  of  the  proceduralist,  availability  of  resources  and institutional/personal preferences. With the rapid pace of genomic discovery and the implementation of moleculardriven personalised care for patients with Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), there is a critical need to perform an increasing number of ancillary studies  on  these  limited-  volume  small  specimens.  Several studies have shown the utility and feasibility of performing ancillary testing for genotyping small specimens, including CNB  and  FNA  samples,  demonstrating  a  success  rate  of about 80%-90% for lung biomarker assays. 7-12  However, the  list  of  lung  biomarkers  that  are  needed  for  patient care  is  constantly  expanding,  and  incomplete  genotyping for guideline-  recommended genomic markers poses a significant challenge to making informed and timely clinical  decisions. 13 The  College  of  American  Pathologists (CAP)  recently  published  guidelines  for  the  collection and handling of thoracic small specimens to improve the adequacy  of  these limited-  volume specimens  for  lung biomarker studies. 6\nIn this study, we evaluated thoracic small specimens (CNB and  FNA  samples)  that  were  collected  in-  house  for  lung cancer  biomarker  testing,  including  factors  such  as  patient demographics,  lesion  size  and  site, collection modality, tumour type, needle gauge and number of passes, to determine  the  molecular  adequacy  and  success  rate  of  comprehensive  lung  biomarker  testing  on  these  samples.  For  the purpose of this study, lung biomarker adequacy was defined as  adequate  tissue  for  testing  the  clinically  recommended genes, EGFR , BRAF , RET , MET , ALK , ROS1 and PD-  L1.",

These  included  procedures  performed  by  interventional radiologists  (IR)  under  CT  or  US  guidance  as  well  as  by interventional pulmonologists using endobronchial US (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)) guidance. Only cases with a lung biomarker request that  included  the  molecular  markers  outlined  by  current NCCN guidelines, as described above, were included in this study set. Biomarker requests at our institution are usually performed on the CNB sample and reflexed to the concurrent FNA sample if the CNB is inadequate for testing or in cases  in  which  the  FNA  is  the  only  specimen  available  for testing (ie, in the absence of a concurrent CNB). The cases were  retrospectively  reviewed  for  patient  demographics, procedure notes, diagnosis and IHC/molecular adequacy to determine success rates for lung biomarker testing.\nAll  FNA  procedures  were  performed  with  rapid  on-  site evaluation  (ROSE)  for  adequacy  and  a  preliminary  diagnosis.  Direct  smears  were  stained  by  using  both  Diff-  Quik and rapid Papanicolaou staining as previously  described. 14 The  FNA  rinse  collected  in  RPMI  medium  was  centrifuged (1500 RPM for 10 min) to prepare either a cytospin or  a  cell  block  preparation.  Details  of  cell  block  preparation  have  been  previously  described. 15  16 Briefly,  the  cell pellet  was  fixed  in  formalin  and  embedded  in  paraffin  to generate a formalin-  fixed paraffin-  embedded (FFPE) block for  sectioning  into  4-5  micron  thick  sections  that  were stained with use of H&E) for morphological evaluation and estimation of tumour fraction. Unstained sections from the cell  block  were  subsequently  used  for  biomarker  testing. All CNB samples collected were fixed immediately in 10% neutral buffered formalin and processed according to standard  histologic  procedures  to  create  an  FFPE  tissue  block that was used for morphological evaluation, diagnosis and subsequent biomarker testing.",

For the DNA-  based NGS assay, 10-20 ng of input DNA was used. In a small subset of cases, if NGS analysis failed, the extracted DNA was used to perform single-  gene sequencing assays, such as Sanger sequencing for EGFR and pyrosequencing for BRAF . 18\nALK , ROS1 , RET and MET genes were evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), as previously described. 19 In brief, FISH was performed with use of the LSI ALK dualcolour break-  apart rearrangement probe (Abbott Molecular, Des Plaines, Illinois, USA); the XT ROS1 dual-  colour, breakapart  probe  (MetaSystems  Group,  Newton,  Massachusetts, USA);  the  Clear-  View  FISH RET dual-  colour  break-  apart probe  (CymoGen  DX,  Biocare  Medical,  Concord,  California, USA); and the CymoGen DX MET/CC7 DNA Probe Kit (Biocare Medical), using criteria previously established in our cytogenetics laboratory. 19 A subset of cases were evaluated by an RNA-  based NGS fusion assay sequenced with use of a commercially available targeted amplicon-  based NGS on the Ion S5XL platform, to amplify a set of targeted fusion sequences in 51 genes that included ALK , ROS1 , RET , MET and NTRK (Oncomine  Comprehensive  Assay  v3M,  ThermoFisher). Details of the NGS RNA fusion assay have been previously described. 20\nImmunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of PD-  L1 was performed on FFPE sections from either the cell block preparation or CNB specimens using the 22C3 antibody clone (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA).

While  most  of  the  recommended lung cancer biomarkers (including ALK , ROS1, RET and MET ) were being tested by an alternative assay such as FISH, testing for NTRK fusions was only performed in a subset of our cohort with RNA-  based NGS fusion assay and therefore were excluded from the statistical analysis of lung biomarker adequacy. Testing for ALK , ROS1 and RET was performed by both FISH and NGS fusion assay in a small subset of cases. Testing outcomes were categorised as follows: (1) adequate for biomarker testing for all genes on the same sample; (2) adequate for biomarker testing in combination with another concurrent malignant FNA or CNB sample; (3) partially adequate for some but not all the requested biomarkers and (4) inadequate for all biomarker testing.",

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "content": "In the current genomic landscape of Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), there is a critical need for the evaluation of biomarkers in patients with advancedstage  disease  to  determine  eligibility  for  targeted  therapy  and immunotherapy. 22 Since most Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is diagnosed from small specimens  obtained  via  minimally  invasive  techniques,  the need  for  optimising  tissue  acquisition  procedures  and  specimen  processing  techniques  to  ensure  the  adequacy  of  these\nlimited-  volume samples for biomarker testing is critical. 23 24 A recent CAP guideline provides recommendations for the collection  and  handling  of  thoracic  small  tissue  specimens  in  an effort to ensure adequacy of these small specimens for ancillary studies. 6 Although  several  studies  have  evaluated  the  success rates of thoracic specimens for molecular testing, the literature is limited on the adequacy and success rates of comprehensive biomarker testing for targeted therapy and immunotherapy as per current NCCN guidelines. Therefore, in this study, we retrospectively reviewed consecutive Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) core biopsies and FNA specimens that were performed in-  house under image guidance and evaluated a variety of parameters including lesion size and site, collection modality, tumour type, needle gauge and number of  passes,  to  determine  the  adequacy  and  success  rate  of  lung biomarker testing on these samples.\nThe results from our retrospective review of lung biomarker adequacy  of  thoracic small tissue specimens  for clinically recommended  genes  ( EGFR , BRAF , RET , MET , ALK , ROS1 and PD-  L1) showed a success rate of 84%, which increased to 87% when a concurrent FNA or CNB sample was combined to complete  the  testing.  These  results  were  comparable  to  those published in the literature for lung biomarker testing for smaller panels involving EGFR , ALK and ROS1 . The overall failure rate for lung biomarker testing was 5%, with partial results for some of  the  required  lung  biomarker tests obtained in 8% of cases. Biomarker testing of CNB specimens showed significantly higher success rates than did biomarker testing of cytology FNA specimens (p=0.0005). This may be largely due to the availability of a FFPE tissue block for CNB specimens that can be used for obtaining multiple sections for all  of  the  requested  biomarker testing.\nAt  our  institution,  all  CNB  specimens  are  initially  evaluated by using 10 levels (2 H&E and 8 unstained sections in between),  followed  by  additional  15  unstained  sections  recut from  the  block  when  the  biomarker  test  request  is  received. Cytology  specimens  frequently  lack  adequate  tumour  on  the cell block preparation for performing biomarker testing. Several studies have reported suboptimal cell block preparation, despite good  aspirates  as  demonstrated  by  adequate  smear  preparations. 15 25-28 The reasons are typically multifactorial and include the  inability  to  collect  additional  dedicated  passes  into  the needle rinse; dilution of a needle pass with good tumour cellularity  with  subsequent  hemodilute  passes;  and  loss  of  cellular material during cell block processing. NGS testing of cytology specimens at our institution does not rely solely on FFPE cell block  preparations,  and  a  large  percentage  of  cases  are  tested with  use  of  direct  smears  alone  or  in  combination  with  cell block  sections.  As  noted  in  prior  studies  from  our  group,  the use of smear preparations for molecular testing has significantly improved our adequacy of cytology samples for both DNA and RNA-  based NGS assays. 15 20 However, our study showed that the overall adequacy of cytology samples compared with their histologic counterparts significantly decreased with the addition of FISH- and IHC-  based biomarker studies, suggesting that lung biomarker adequacy of cytology specimens is often limited by suboptimal cell block preparation. These results underscore the need for collecting an adequate sample for cell block preparation during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) TBNA procedures, as highlighted in the recent CAP recommendations. 6\nAlthough our results demonstrated that both Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-  TBNA and IR-  FNA  specimens  have  similar  overall  success  rates  for  lung biomarker testing, the adequacy of NGS testing is lower in the latter (85% vs 72%, respectively). This is likely a reflection of the vastly different procurement processes for the two modalities.\nFor  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-  TBNA  procedures,  the  bronchoscopist  relies  largely on ROSE and performs on average six needle passes to collect an adequate sample for diagnosis and subsequent biomarker testing. Furthermore, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) procedures are largely dependent on acquisition of only an FNA sample, with only 7% of cases in this cohort having  a  concurrent  surgical  biopsy  specimen.  In  contrast,  IR procedures, especially transthoracic procedures, focus primarily on collecting CNB samples, and typically 2 FNA needle passes are performed during the procedure. In this study, 92% of all IR-  FNA samples had a concurrent CNB specimen collected. As previously mentioned, lung biomarker test requests at our institution are reflexed to the CNB samples, and FNA specimens are usually used to supplement the CNB sample or in cases in which the biopsy has insufficient tumour. This is reflected in the significantly  lower  numbers  of  IR-  FNA  samples  used  for  biomarker testing  seen  in  this  cohort.  Therefore,  unlike  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)  TBNA specimens,  the  IR-  FNA  samples  usually  have  limited  material on both smears and cell block preparation, as reflected in the significantly  lower  adequacy  rates  for  both  NGS-  based  testing (72% adequate) as well as FISH (76% adequate) and IHC (78% adequate) assays.\nVariables such as age, gender, lesion size, site and diagnosis showed  no  significant  correlation  with  success  rates  of  lung biomarker testing. As expected, biomarker adequacy correlated strongly  with  DNA  concentration.  The  use  of  22G  needles in  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-  TBNA  procedures  positively  correlated  with  lung biomarker  adequacy  but  showed  no  correlation  in  CNB  or IR-  FNA  samples.  In  addition,  there  was  no  evidence  that  the number of passes for obtaining CNB and FNA samples correlated with the adequacy for lung biomarker testing.\nWith the increasing number  of clinically relevant lung biomarkers needed for patient care decisions, there is a critical need  for  optimal  collection  and  processing  of  thoracic  small specimens  to  judiciously  triage  and  perform  all  of  the  necessary testing. Although lung molecular testing guidelines do not outline specific assays for relevant biomarker testing, there is a definite shift from performing single gene testing to expanded multiplexed  assays  capable  of  interrogating  multiple  genes simultaneously. 22 This primarily stems from the need to do more with less,  as  limited-  volume  specimens  frequently  fall  short  in providing all the relevant genomic information required to guide patient  treatment.  For  example,  current  NCCN guidelines list several  methodologies  for  testing EGFR and BRAF (real-  time PCR,  Sanger  sequencing  preferably  with  tumour  enrichment, NGS), ALK and ROS1 (FISH,  IHC,  NGS,  targeted  real-  time PCR), RET (FISH,  RT-  PCR,  NGS) and MET (NGS, RT-  PCR). Testing all of these biomarkers by single gene sequencing assays would  require  a  minimum  of  20-30  FFPE  sections  from  a moderately  cellular  biopsy  and/or  FNA  specimen  (table  4).  If using  direct  smears,  10-13  moderately  cellular  smears  would be needed for sequencing and FISH assays alone. The ability to combine biomarker testing with use of multiplexed assays such as  NGS has provided the opportunity to perform these assays on multiple genes using limited material. In fact, current NCCN guidelines recommend broad molecular profiling by using either an  FDA-  approved  or  laboratory-  developed  platform  to  test  at a  minimum  the  guideline-  recommended  biomarkers  ( EGFR , BRAF , ALK , ROS1 , RET,  MET and NTRK )  with  an  option  to test for emerging biomarkers including high-  level MET amplification, ERBB2 mutations and tumour mutational burden (TMB).\nOne limitation of our study was the retrospective nature spanning a period of 2 years, during which lung biomarker evaluation was performed by using different testing methodologies. Whereas  mutation  testing  was  performed  primarily  using  a\nDNA-  based NGS assay for all samples, fusion testing was done using  FISH,  NGS, or a combination of both. The FISH assay evaluates ALK , ROS1 and RET fusions, but the NGS multiplexed fusion  assay  includes  several  other  genes  including NTRK . Although the subset of cases evaluated by the NGS fusion assay was small (n=312), the overall success rate of fusion testing by NGS ( ALK , ROS1 , RET , MET , NTRK )  was 88%. Hence, if an appropriately  designed  NGS  testing  assay  is  used,  with  which DNA and RNA are simultaneously  extracted,  lung  biomarker testing  could  be  performed  by  using  as  few  as  10-15  FFPE sections or 4-6 direct smears (table 4). With use of such an assay, in  addition  to  the  current  guideline-  recommended  genes,  the combined DNA and RNA NGS assay would cover ERBB2 and KRAS mutations, MET amplifications and TMB.\nIn  summary,  this  study  showed  that  thoracic  small  tissue specimens  can  be  used  successfully  to  provide  prognostic  and predictive information for the current guideline-  recommended biomarkers for Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in most cases. The availability of a tissue block and concurrently acquired CNB and FNA samples increases the chances of adequacy for lung biomarker testing. The use of multiplexed expanded molecular profiling assays such as NGS, which judiciously uses limited amounts of tissue for testing, can provide all the clinically required biomarker testing needed to guide the care of patients with Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).",
