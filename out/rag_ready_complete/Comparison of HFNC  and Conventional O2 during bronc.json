Objectives: We aimed to compare HFNC and conventional oxygen therapy (COT) during nasal bronchoscopy in patients at high risk for desaturation (morbid obesity, narrow trachea, or baseline hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia). Methods: In this multicenter randomized controlled trial, patients scheduled for bronchoscopy and presenting with any high-risk factors were randomly assigned to receive HFNC or COT after providing written consent. Vital signs, pulse oximetry (SpO2 ), and transcutaneous carbon dioxide were continuously monitored. The occurrence of desaturation (SpO2 < 90% lasted . 10 s), frequency of examination interruption, and treatment escalation were compared between groups. Results: Of 148 initially enrolled patients, 6 withdrew, leaving 72 and 70 in the HFNC and COT groups, respectively. Most of the patients had airway stenosis. HFNC significantly reduced desaturation occurrence during bronchoscopy (34.7% vs. 61.4%; P =0.016), with fewer instances of examination interruption (26.4% vs. 58.6%; P , 0.001) and less frequent treatment escalation (30.6% vs. 57.1%; P =0.001). During the examination, the lowest SpO2 was higher with HFNC (94% [interquartile range, 87 -98%] vs. 87.5% [79 -93%]; P =0.001), whereas the highest transcutaneous carbon dioxide was lower (64.6 [56.8 -70.1] vs. 68.3 [62.3 -77.0] mm Hg; P =0.04). No significant differences were observed regarding the time to the first desaturation, bronchoscopy withdrawal, durations of desaturation and bronchoscopy examination, or occurrence of other adverse events between groups.

HFNC offers several physiological bene /uniFB01 ts for patients with pulmonary disease. These include washing out the dead space in the upper airway, improving ventilation ef /uniFB01 ciency, reducing respiratory drive and inspiratory effort, and providing a variable positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) (3).\nHypoxemia, a common complication during endoscopic procedures, particularly those performed under anesthesia (4 -8), can range in occurrence from 29% to 90% in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) during /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopy examination (8 -13). Several factors may contribute to hypoxemia during bronchoscopy examinations, including preexisting pulmonary diseases, increased airway resistance due to bronchoscope insertion, upper airway collapse under anesthesia, and worsened lung function due to suctioning, bleeding, or pneumothorax (14 -17).\nIn recent years, HFNC has been increasingly used during endoscopic procedures (4 -15, 18 -22). Studies have demonstrated HFNC ' s advantages over COT in reducing hypoxemia during bronchoscopy examination (11 -13, 22). However, the indiscriminate use of HFNC for all patients undergoing bronchoscopy examination may be unwarranted because of the associated high cost of supplies. In an RCT involving 788 patients undergoing bronchoscopy examinations with a mean duration of , 15 minutes, fewer than one-third of patients experienced pulse oximetry saturation (SpO2 ) , 90% with COT (12). Thus, reserving HFNC for high-risk patients, such as those requiring extended bronchoscopy examinations, complex therapeutic interventions, or deep sedation (23), may be more cost effective (16, 24). In addition, most previous RCTs have evaluated bronchoscopy examinations performed via the oral route (11, 13), which might compromise some bene /uniFB01 ts of HFNC, such as constant FI O2 and PEEP, because of the patient ' s mouth being open throughout the procedure (25). The impact of HFNC during nasal bronchoscopy remains largely unknown. Therefore, we proposed an RCT to compare HFNC to COT during nasal bronchoscopy examination in patients with\nhigh-risk factors, hypothesizing a lower occurrence of hypoxemia in the HFNC group.",

      "content": "Anindependent statistician generated the randomization sequence, which was sealed in sequentially numbered and opaque envelopes. Eligible patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to the HFNC or COT group. HFNC(OH-70C; Micomme) was initiated at 50 L/min and increased up to 60 L/min if well tolerated. The FI O2 was set at 0.45, with the temperature at 37 /C14 C. The size of the nasal cannula was chosen based on the patient ' s\nnasal prongs, ensuring it was smaller than 50% of the nasal prong size. Patients in the COTgroup received 6 L/min pure oxygen via a double-prong nasal cannula (Healthcare Medical Supplies Co.).\nBefore using the assigned oxygen device, anesthesia induction was administered and lasted approximately 5 minutes and sedation doses were adjusted to maintain SpO2 between 98% and 100%. Local anesthesia with lidocaine was administered before the bronchoscopy examination. During the examination, the anesthesiologist adjusted the dosage of anesthetics to maintain spontaneous breathing and a Modi /uniFB01 ed Observer ' s Assessment of Alertness/Sedation ( see Table E1 in the data supplement) score of 2 -3 points (26). Experienced pulmonologists performed the bronchoscopy examination in the bronchoscopy suite, with continuous vital signs and SpO2 monitoring. Transcutaneous carbon dioxide (PtcCO2 ) was continuously monitored using a digital system (SDMS; SenTec AG). FI O2 for HFNC and oxygen /uniFB02 ow for COT were maintained until the occurrence of desaturation or bronchoscopy completion.\nAtreatment algorithm for hypoxemia during bronchoscopy examination was implemented (27). When the patient experienced desaturation, jaw thrust maneuvers and/or interruption of the bronchoscopy examination were used to improve oxygenation. If desaturation persisted, treatment escalation was initiated: FI O 2 increased to 1.0 in the HFNC group, and COT switched to HFNC at 60 L/min with initial FI O 2 at 0.45, adjustable to 1.0 if hypoxemia persisted. Should hypoxemia continue, bronchoscopy withdrawal was the next step, and advanced airway management, including nasopharyngeal airways, oropharyngeal airways, laryngeal mask, or tracheal intubation, was considered (27). The pulmonologists determined whether to resume bronchoscopy after oxygenation recovery based on the patient ' s clinical condition. In addition, a designated staff member was assigned to monitor and document patients ' vital signs throughout the bronchoscopy procedure. This staff member was responsible for tracking any changes in vital signs that might necessitate treatment escalation.\nBronchoscopy examination was terminated if any of the following criteria were met: 1 ) occurrence of adverse events such as severe hypotension (systolic blood pressure , 90 mm Hg), severe hypertension\n(systolic blood pressure . 180 mm Hg), . 50% changes of blood pressure from baseline, respiratory suppression, cardiac arrest, massive bleeding, or pneumothorax; 2 ) despite maximal oxygen delivery, SpO2 could not be maintained above 90%. All necessary rescue treatment and resuscitation equipment were prepared and available in the bronchoscopy suite. In the event of adverse events, patients were transferred to a general unit or intensive care unit for continuous monitoring until full recovery. After the procedure, patients were observed until their vital signs returned to prebronchoscopy status or their conditions stabilized.",

      "title": "Discussion",
      "content": "In this RCT, we found that HFNC signi /uniFB01 cantly reduced the occurrence of hypoxemic events during bronchoscopy examination in patients with high-risk factors, thereby diminishing the subsequent need for desaturation management, including jaw thrust maneuvers, bronchoscopy interruption, and treatment escalation. In addition, HFNC reduced the maximum levels of PtcCO2 during bronchoscopy examination.\nPrior studies have consistently demonstrated HFNC ' s superiority over\nCOTinreducing hypoxemia occurrence (11 -13, 22, 28) and the need for airway intervention and bronchoscopy examination interruptions (28), together with fewer adverse events (12, 13), shorter duration of bronchoscopy examination (12), and greater patient comfort (13). However, the reported occurrence of hypoxemia with HFNC in these RCTs ranged from 5.9% to 13.3% (11 -13, 22), contrasting with the 34.7% occurrence in our study. This difference suggests that the indiscriminate use of HFNC might be unnecessary.\nTo date, only two studies have speci /uniFB01 cally targeted high-risk patients.\nZhang and colleagues (8) reported signi /uniFB01 cant reductions in hypoxemia occurrence and the need for airway interventions with HFNC compared with tight/uniFB01 tting masks in highrisk patients, identi /uniFB01 ed via a screening tool for obstructive sleep apnea. Both COT and HFNCgroups exhibited lower hypoxemia occurrences (29.2% and 4.6%, respectively) compared with our study ' s occurrence, suggesting potential inaccuracies in using obstructive sleep apnea screening tools to identify high-risk patients. Moreover, such tight/uniFB01 tting masks are rarely used in clinical oxygen therapy (29), questioning the generalizability of the study /uniFB01 ndings to common clinical practice. In contrast, our study used more clinically relevant high-risk factors and a more frequently used COT control, lending substantial clinical relevance to our /uniFB01 ndings. Ben-Menachem and colleagues identi /uniFB01 ed lung transplant recipients as a high-risk population for hypoxemia and compared HFNC and COT during bronchoscopy (28). They found that HFNCsigni /uniFB01 cantly reduced the proportion of patients who had the lowest SpO2 , 90% (16.2% vs. 69.2%; P , 0.001). Notably, when using the same SpO2 , 90% criterion to de /uniFB01 ne hypoxemia, the hypoxemia occurrence in their HFNC group was lower than in ours, possibly because of a lower initial FI O 2 of 0.45 in our study compared with 1.0 in theirs. Similarly, all RCTs except one used HFNC at FI O2 of 1.0 during endoscopic examinations, complicating the differentiation of the effects of high /uniFB02 ows and high FI O2 levels on oxygenation improvement. In contrast, our study marks the /uniFB01 rst attempt to discern the individual impacts of /uniFB02 ows and FI O2 levels in oxygenation improvement. Riccio and colleagues (20) conducted a study comparing HFNCat 60 L/min with COT at comparable FI O 2 levels for morbidly obese patients with a BMI close to 50 kg/m 2 undergoing colonoscopy under procedural sedation. They did not observe signi /uniFB01 cant differences in the occurrence of hypoxemia. The variance between our /uniFB01 ndings and theirs may stem from differences in patient demographics; they speci /uniFB01 cally enrolled morbidly obese patients whose airways might be prone to collapse during sedation and may not be adequately maintained by HFNC, whereas none of our patients in the HFNCgroup had a BMI > 30 kg/m 2 .\nCurrently, there is no widely accepted protocol for managing hypoxemia during bronchoscopy. The 2003 St. Vincent ' s\nDefinition of abbreviations : BMI=body mass index; CCI=Charlson Comorbidity Index; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)=chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; COT=conventional oxygen therapy;\nHFNC=high-flow nasal cannula; SpO2 =pulse oximetry.\nData are presented as n , n (%), or median (interquartile range).\n*The BMI is the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters.\nDefinition of abbreviations : COT=conventional oxygen therapy; FIO2 =fraction of inspiration oxygen; HFNC = high-flow nasal cannula;\nMOAA/S=Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation; TCI=target controlled infusion.\nData are presented as n , n (%), or median (interquartile range).\nstepwise approach suggests escalating oxygen to 6 L/min and using jaw thrust maneuvers (30); if these steps fail to improve oxygenation, a nasopharyngeal airway should be inserted and oxygen delivered via a 7 F catheter near the larynx or trachea. Persistent desaturation calls for bronchoscope withdrawal or sedation reversal (30). However, using a nasopharyngeal airway and a 7 F catheter is rare, and their effectiveness in enhancing oxygenation is debated because of the discomfort and dif /uniFB01 culty in placement. In many institutions, if oxygenation does not improve with jaw thrust maneuvers and 6 L/min oxygen, the common response is to withdraw the bronchoscope, reverse sedation, and possibly proceed to intubation. However, repeatedly inserting and withdrawing a bronchoscope in the nasal cavity can lead to laryngeal spasms, nasal bleeding, and discomfort for the patient (29, 31 -33). In our study, jaw thrust maneuvers and/or bronchoscopy interruption only marginally improved oxygenation in a few patients (three in each group). Contrastingly, using HFNC at 60 L/min with an FI O2 of 0.45 prevented\nthe need for bronchoscope withdrawal and sedation reversal in 14 out of 40 patients in COT group, with an increase in FI O2 to 1.0 further obviating the need for these interventions in another 15 patients. Altogether, HFNC was effective in maintaining SpO2 . 90% for 72.5% (29/40) of patients, for whom COT at 6 L/min and manual interventions were insuf /uniFB01 cient. In all, the use of HFNC, particularly at the maximum setting, reduces the need for repeated bronchoscope insertions and sedation reversal, thereby decreasing procedure duration and enhancing patient comfort.\nIn Tao and colleagues ' systematic review and meta-analysis assessing the ef /uniFB01 cacy of HFNCfor patients undergoing endoscopic examinations, /uniFB01 ndings from /uniFB01 ve studies involving 238 patients indicated no signi /uniFB01 cant differences in end-procedure PaCO2 or PtcCO2 levels between the HFNC and COT groups (34). However, in our study, we observed a lower maximum PtcCO2 level. It is worth noting that our study focused solely on the highest PtcCO2 level during bronchoscopy examinations rather than at the end of the procedure. During bronchoscopy, factors such as procedural\nsedation, increased airway resistance, anxiety, irritation, and discomfort can lead to heightened CO2 production, potentially resulting in the peak level occurring during the examination rather than at the end. Thus, our assessment of the highest PtcCO2 level may provide a more accurate re /uniFB02 ection of the advantages of HFNC over COT in CO2 clearance.",

      "content": "Our study presents several notable strengths. First, compared with two prior RCTs investigating HFNC use in high-risk patients, our study stands out for its selection of clinically relevant high-risk factors and control group. Second, we distinguish between the effects of high /uniFB02 ows and high FI O 2 levels on oxygenation improvement, a novel aspect in our research. Third, we provide a practical treatment algorithm for managing hypoxemia during bronchoscopy examinations, accompanied by detailed results at each step. This elucidates the marginal bene /uniFB01 ts of interventions such as jaw thrust maneuvers and/or bronchoscopy interruptions, as well as the advantages of HFNCusage.\nDefinition of abbreviations : COT=conventional oxygen therapy; FIO2 =fraction of inspiration oxygen; HFNC = high-flow nasal cannula; NA = not applicable; SpO2 =pulse oximetry; PtcCO2 =transcutaneous carbon dioxide.\nData are presented as n , n (%), or median (interquartile range).\nOur study also has several limitations. First, it enrolled patients with four different risk factors and did not limit the types of bronchoscopy procedures. Thus, our /uniFB01 ndings might not apply to any speci /uniFB01 c group, such as morbidly obese patients. In addition, critically ill patients requiring noninvasive ventilation or endotracheal intubation to maintain oxygenation during bronchoscopy examinations were excluded, which means that our study /uniFB01 ndings cannot be applied to these patients. Furthermore, the primary population included in the study\nconsisted of patients with tracheobronchial stenosis; therefore, further research is needed to explore the application of HFNC in managing other high-risk diseases.",
