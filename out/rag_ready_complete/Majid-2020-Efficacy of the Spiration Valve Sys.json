      "content": "Chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD))  is currently the fourth leading cause of death worldwide [1]. Emphysema affects an estimated 1.8% of the world population, and the pathophysiological effects are loss of lung elastic recoil, air trapping, and lung hyperinflation [2].\nCurrent therapeutic options for patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) include lifestyle modification, pharmacotherapy, pulmonary rehabilitation, and long-term oxygen therapy [3-5]; however, subjects with severe emphysema remain significantly  disabled  despite  optimal  medical  management. Unfortunately, these therapies have limited ability to either reverse or decrease lung hyperinflation caused by alveolar destruction [1].\nFor the subset of patients with advanced emphysema and hyperinflation, the National Emphysema Treatment Trial showed that lung volume reduction surgery led to an  improvement  in  pulmonary  function,  respiratory symptoms, quality of life, exercise capacity, and survival; however, it was associated with significant 90-day morbidity and mortality [6]. Currently, 2 types of endobronchial valves are available and approved by the FDA in the United  States  [7]:  Zephyr ® endobronchial  valve  (PulmonX) and Spiration  Valve  System  (SVS) ® (Formerly known  as  Intrabronchial  valve,  Olympus  Respiratory America) that can achieve lung volume reduction in a minimally invasive method [8]. They consist of a one-way valve that blocks inspired airflow to the target lobe while allowing air and mucus out, thus leading to atelectasis of the  emphysematous  lung  distal  to  the  valve  [9].  Compared to the Zephyr ® valve, evidence about the efficacy of SVS ® valve is unclear. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to explore the efficacy of the SVS ® , including  current  randomized  controlled  trials  (RCT) available in the literature.",

We defined the use of SVS ® for the intervention and the usual standard of care as the comparator. Data collected include: changes in pulmonary function (FEV1, measured in liters and % predicted volume), quality of life using the Saint George respiratory questionnaire ([SGRQ] measured in points), changes in RV (measured in liters), changes in dyspnea score using modified medical research council ([mMRC] measured in points), and changes in the 6-min walking test ([6MWT] measured in meters). For the safety analysis, we included the following outcomes: Allcause mortality, risk pneumothorax after the intervention, for this outcome we used the prevalence of pneumothorax in emphysema patients previously published [12] and the risk of an acute exacerbation of  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (AECOPD).

For this outcome, intergroup heterogeneity was statistically significant ( p = 0.02), and I 2  was 71%.\nWith regard to AECOPD, overall Relative risk (RR) was 1.68 (95% CI 1.04-2.70), I 2   =  0%  (GRADE: MODERATE). At 3 months, Ninane et al. [26] reported a Relative risk (RR) of 1.34 (95% CI 0.612.94, I 2 = not applicable). At 6 months, Relative risk (RR) 2.08 (95% CI 1.00-4.32, I 2 = 0%), and at 12 months, the Relative risk (RR) was 1.60 (95% CI 0.56-4.59, I 2 = not applicable). For this outcome, intergroup heterogeneity was not statistically significant I 2 = 0% ( p = 0.78; Fig. 8).\nFinally, a summary of funnel plots is showed in online suppl. Fig. 8-12, and summary of evidence table using GRADE approach is shown in Table 3.",

      "content": "The results of the current systematic review and metaanalysis  showed  a  clinically  significant  improvement  in lung function and health-related quality of life following SVS ® ,  placement  in  patients  with  severe  heterogeneous emphysema,  and  hyperinflation.  However,  pooled  data from randomized control trials reported high heterogeneity, specially associated with the evaluation of CV. Only the\nEMPROVE and REACH Trials included patients without CV based on a preprocedural HRCT evidencing > 90% integrity of interlobar fissure without segmental vessels crossing between adjacent lobes. Additionally, none of the studies included a physiological assessment of CV with Chartis; thus, the results may provide a false impression about the lower efficacy as well as a lower rate of pneumothorax after the intervention compared to the standard of care. The potential benefits of the SVS ® are more pronounced in carefully selected patients as evidenced by a subgroup analysis including just the RCTs without CV [17, 28]. This analysis showed an overall improvement in the predicted FEV1 of 30 mL; however, subgroup analysis by both risk of bias and CV showed an improvement of 120 mL, similar to the results obtained on our previous meta-analysis evaluating the Zephyr ® endobronchial valves [29].\nIn a previous systematic review and meta-analysis, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of Zephyr ® endobronchial valves in the treatment of severe emphysema in patients without CV [29], like our subgroup analysis. We found that BLVR with endobronchial valves provides significant and clinically meaningful short-term improvements in both patients with severe heterogeneous, homogeneous emphysema and hyperinflation without CV, but\nwith an increase in adverse events such as pneumothorax, AECOPD, or pneumonia [2]. In another recently published systematic review and meta-analysis including the vast majority of available techniques to reduce lung volume, they showed that the greatest improvements were in the predicted % FEV1 (21.77%) and the 6MWT (increase of 49 m) after endobronchial valves placement compared with other procedures such as lung volume reduction surgery, sclerosing agents, and coils. They did not include the SVS ® in the analysis, but our results are comparable for the change in the predicted % FEV1 [30]; however, we did not find an improvement on the 6MWT, possibly due to high  inconsistency  between  the  studies,  lack  of  assessment for the presence of CV in half of the trials included in the analysis [26, 27], and inconsistent use of pulmonary rehabilitation in the postoperative period. This contrasts with the Zephyr ® valves, which showed a significant improvement in the 6MWT after the procedure where pulmonary rehabilitation was required.\nRV was also improved after SVS ® in patients without CV, change after therapy, mean change was according to minimally important difference previously published by Hartman et al. [31]. Regarding the quality of life, our analysis showed an improvement on the overall SGRQ, and a\nsubgroup analysis showed that this change persisted over a period of at least 12 months of follow-up. In contrast, Zephyr ® showed a slightly greater improvement in the score (-8.42 points) [29].\nAccording  to  our  analysis,  we  found  an  overall  increase in the risk of pneumothorax; however, a subgroup analysis showed a significant increase of pneumothorax in  patients  with  confirmed  fissure  integrity  (Relative risk (RR)  4.64). The  risk  of  pneumothorax  was  lower  compared  with Zephyr ® valves, which showed a relative risk for pneumothorax of 6.32 [29].\nAdditionally, we found an increased risk of AECOPD as expected after these procedures, especially during the first 6 months after the procedure patients reports 2 times higher risk than controls. However, these complications are not associated to an increased risk of mortality.\nThe current evidence from RCTs included in our review highlighted the importance of patient selection prior to the use of SVS placement for the treatment of advanced emphysema. Studies published before 2015 showed negative results in several outcomes as compared with those published since then which have shown positive findings. This  may  be  explained  by  study  methodology  including the preprocedural assessment of the integrity of interlobar fissures to determine the presence of CV. This was  evidenced  by  the  positive  results  obtained  by  the EMPROVE and REACH trials in the predicted (%) FEV1 and SGRQ. However, these studies did not show a significant improvement in the 6MWT likely due to the inconsistent use of pulmonary rehabilitation although further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis. Our findings suggest that, in selected patients with severe heterogeneous  emphysema,  hyperinflation  without  CV, SVS ® should be a therapeutic alternative with improvement sustained up to 12 months after valve placement. The results of this meta-analysis should not be used as a direct comparison with previous studies and meta-analysis using the Zephyr valve since the patient population and  selection  criteria  have  significant  differences.  Furthermore, studies focused on the direct comparison are needed in order to improve the body of evidence.\nMajor limitation of this review is (1) the limited number of RCTs included after our literature search and publication  bias  encountered  after  our  visual  inspection, (2) most of the outcomes were rated as LOW or VERY LOW using grade approach, and (3) main results were principally drawn by 2 RCTs due to the lack of assessment of CV in the remaining studies. Additionally, the assessment of CV was based solely on HRCT measurement, and none of the studies used the Chartis System.",
