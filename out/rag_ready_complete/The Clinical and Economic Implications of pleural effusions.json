Clinical and economic implications of different recurrent MPE treatment pathways have not been evaluated fully. RESEARCH QUESTION: What clinical outcomes, complications, health care resource use, and costs are associated with various rapidly recurrent MPE treatment pathways? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study using Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Medicare data (2011-2015) included patients 66 to 90 years of age with rapidly recurrent MPE. Rapid recurrence was defined as receipt of a second pleural procedure within 14 days of the first thoracentesis, including nondefinitive repeated thoracentesis or a definitive treatment option including chest tube, indwelling pleural catheter (IPC), or thoracoscopy. RESULTS: Among 8,378 patients with MPE, 3,090 patients (36.9%) had rapidly recurrent MPE (mean ± SD age, 75.9 ± 6.6 years; 45.6% male; primary cancer, 62.9% lung and 37.1% other). Second pleural procedures were nondefinitive thoracentesis (62.3%), chest tube (17.1%), IPC (13.2%), or thoracoscopy (7.4%). A third pleural procedure was required more frequently if the second pleural procedure was nondefinitive thoracentesis vs chest tube placement, IPC placement, or thoracoscopy (70.3% vs 44.1% vs 17.9% vs 14.4%, respectively). The mean number of subsequent pleural procedures over the patient's lifetime varied significantly among the procedures (1.74, 0.82, 0.31, and 0.22 procedures for patients receiving thoracentesis, chest tube, IPC, and thoracoscopy, respectively; P < .05). Average total costs after the second pleural procedure to death adjusted for age at primary cancer diagnosis, race, year of second pleural procedure, Charlson comorbidity index, cancer stage at primary diagnosis, and time from primary cancer diagnosis to diagnostic thoracentesis were lower with IPC ($37,443; P < .0001) or chest tube placement ($40,627; P = .004) vs thoracentesis ($47,711). Patients receiving thoracoscopy ($45,386; P = .5) incurred similar costs as patients receiving thoracentesis. INTERPRETATION: Early definitive treatment was associated with fewer subsequent procedures and lower costs in patients with rapidly recurrent MPE.",

The speci /uniFB01 c objectives of this study were: (1) to evaluate the different longitudinal patient treatment pathways after initial MPE thoracentesis and (2) to illustrate the differences in clinical outcomes, complications, health care resource use, and economic burden across the various treatment pathways.",

      "content": "Baseline characteristics evaluated included age, sex, race and ethnicity, marital status, reason for Medicare entitlement, SEER registry geographic location, primary health care payer, Charlson comorbidity index score, 8 year of cancer diagnosis, primary cancer site, and primary cancer stage. The outcomes that were evaluated were selected because the study sought to evaluate the clinical implications, health care resource use, and costs associated with the various procedural pathways. Primary outcomes were proportions of patients requiring subsequent pleural procedures after the second pleural procedure and numbers of subsequent pleural procedures after the second pleural procedure (per patient and per patient day of life, overall and by site of service). Subsequent pleural procedures were de /uniFB01 ned as procedures administered after the second pleural procedure (third treatment and beyond). Survival time was calculated as the time between the second pleural procedures and end of follow-up (ie, 12 months from /uniFB01 rst thoracentesis or from the /uniFB01 rst thoracentesis to death).\nSecondary outcomes were the proportions of patients requiring hospitalization, the proportions of hospitalizations associated with early procedures (MPE-related\nprocedures), the numbers of inpatient days associated with pleural procedures, the numbers of survival days after the second pleural procedure, the rate of pneumothoraces per patient day of life (diagnosis codes in e-Appendix 4), and the total costs of care after the second pleural procedure (overall and per patient day of life). Because patients with MPE may be hospitalized for other comorbid conditions, early pleural procedure during an inpatient stay (ie, days 0-2 of hospitalization according to Ost et al 11 ) was used as a measure of whether the MPE was the initial reason for hospitalization. Inpatient hospitalizations with missing discharge dates were excluded. Treatment-related pneumothoraces were de /uniFB01 ned as pneumothoraces diagnosed 0 to 2 days after subsequent thoracenteses or IPC placement. Rate of pneumothorax per subsequent pleural procedure (third treatment and beyond) was calculated as the number of treatment-related pneumothoraces diagnosed within 2 days of thoracentesis or IPC placement divided by the number of subsequent thoracentesis procedures, the number of IPCs placed, or both (third treatment and beyond). The average number of pneumothoraces per patient (third treatment) was the number of treatment-related pneumothoraces divided by type of second pleural procedure.\nTotal costs were calculated using the Medicare payment amount for any inpatient, outpatient, carrier, hospice, home health administration, and durable medical equipment care claim between the second pleural procedure date and the end of patient follow-up, regardless of whether a pleural procedure was performed. When analyzing total costs and total costs per day of life, only patients who died during follow-up were included, given that cost per day of life follows a U-shaped pattern, with the most expensive days being at the end of life. 13 Patients who were alive at 1 year were censored from the analyses. Hence, these costs are for the 84% of patients with cancer and MPE who died within 1 year of the second pleural intervention. Speci /uniFB01 c variables and SEER Medicare data /uniFB01 les used for these cost calculations were those evaluated by Bremner et al. 14 Patients with total costs of $0 were excluded from the analysis.",

Only 37.7% of patients received a de /uniFB01 nitive procedure as their second pleural procedure (chest tube placement, 17.1%; IPC placement, 13.2%; and thoracoscopy, 7.4%). After this initial treatment, patients with thoracentesis were more likely to require subsequent MPE treatment (70.3% vs 44.1% for chest tube placement, 17.9% for IPC placement, and 14.4% for thoracoscopy) (Fig 3A) and underwent signi /uniFB01 cantly more subsequent pleural procedures (1.74 vs 0.31 for IPC placement and 0.22 for thoracoscopy; P < . 0001) (Table 2). Among patients requiring a third pleural procedure, patients with thoracentesis for both the second and third procedures showed the greatest burden (average additional procedures, 2.13) (Fig 3B). The /uniFB01 ndings of greater numbers of subsequent pleural procedures with thoracentesis also were con /uniFB01 rmed and illustrated in a competing risk model (e-Fig 1) and were consistent by type of cancer and site of service (e-Tables 1).\nThe median length of survival in days from the second pleural procedure to the end of follow-up or death was\nstatistically signi /uniFB01 cantly higher among patients who received a thoracoscopy (64 days) or thoracentesis (63 days) vs in those who underwent chest tube placement (43 days) or IPC placement (45 days; P < . 0001) (Table 3). Survival probability was higher among patients who received a nonde /uniFB01 nitive thoracentesis to treat the /uniFB01 rst recurrence relative to those who received a de /uniFB01 nitive pleural procedure (eFig 2A, 2B). Median survival among patients who died during follow-up (n ¼ 2,589) was highest among patients who underwent a thoracoscopy as the second pleural procedure (49.5 days; IQR, 20.5-100.5 days), followed by thoracentesis (41.0 days; IQR, 17.0109.5 days), IPC placement (40.0 days; IQR, 13.091.0 days), and chest tube placement (35.5 days; IQR, 20.5-100.5 days; P ¼ .0072). Despite differences in survival, the previously shown pattern of subsequent pleural procedures was consistent in that patients who received a thoracentesis as the second pleural procedure underwent the highest overall number of subsequent pleural procedures per patient day of life, with chest tube placement, IPC, and thoracoscopy having lower rates (0.0133 vs 0.0078 vs 0.0035 vs 0.0018 procedures per patient day of life, respectively [ P < .0001]) (Table 4).",

In the /uniFB01 nal multivariable model, second pleural procedure type, age at primary cancer diagnosis, race, year of second pleural procedure, Charlson comorbidity index score, cancer stage at primary cancer diagnosis, and time from cancer diagnosis to /uniFB01 rst thoracentesis were associated with average total costs after the second pleural procedure. Adjusted average total costs were higher for patients treated for the /uniFB01 rst recurrence of MPE with nonde /uniFB01 nitive thoracentesis ($47,711) compared with patients treated with de /uniFB01 nitive IPC placement ($37,443) or chest tube placement ($40,627). Patients 66 to 70 years of age incurred higher adjusted average total costs ($48,024) compared with patients 76 to 80 years of age ($41,267) and patients 80 to 90 years of age ($35,705). Adjusted average total cost was lower with Charlson comorbidity index score of 3 vs 0 ($38,863 vs $51,201) and > 6 months vs # 6 months from cancer diagnosis to /uniFB01 rst thoracentesis ($38,914 vs $46,640) (Table 8).",

      "content": "American Thoracic Society, Society of Thoracic Surgeons, and Society of Thoracic Radiology clinical\nguidelines recommend the use of de /uniFB01 nitive treatment as the /uniFB01 rst-line intervention for symptomatic recurrent MPE. 4 The current analysis of 3,090 patients with rapidly recurrent MPE from 2011 through 2015 SEER Medicare data found that a minority of patients (37.7%) received de /uniFB01 nitive pleural procedures (chest tube placement, 45.3%; IPC placement, 35.0%; and thoracoscopy, 19.7%) and 62.3% of patients underwent repeat nonde /uniFB01 nitive thoracentesis procedures as the second pleural\nprocedure. The previously published evaluation 11 using 2007 through 2011 SEER Medicare data found that only 23.9% of patients received guidelineconsistent de /uniFB01 nitive care (IPC placement, 17%; thoracoscopy, 23%; and chest tube placement, 60%). Hence, the proportion of patients with recurrent MPE receiving de /uniFB01 nitive care has increased since the prior study, primarily because of an increase in the use of IPC placement, which more than doubled (from 7.4% to 16.5%), whereas the proportions of patients\nNote: Did not include thoracoscopy to thoracoscopy, thoracoscopy to IPC, and\nIPC to thoracoscopy are suppressed because of low sample size.\n]\nreceiving the other de /uniFB01 nitive procedures decreased (chest tube placement, from 22.1% to 14.9%; thoracoscopy, from 11.2% to 5.6%). The proportion of patients receiving thoracentesis remained relatively stable during the years of our study (from 59.3% in 2011 to 63.0% in 2015) (e-Fig 3).\nCompared with patients who received a nonde /uniFB01 nitive second pleural procedure, patients who underwent de /uniFB01 nitive pleural procedures underwent fewer overall\nsubsequent pleural procedures per patient day of life; fewer subsequent pleural procedures in the ED, inpatient, and outpatient settings per patient day of life; and fewer hospitalizations with early pleural procedures. The /uniFB01 ndings regarding the number of subsequent pleural procedures are similar to those observed by Ost et al. 11\nAdditionally, this study evaluated the economic implications of the various treatment pathways, which\nData are presented as No. (%) or median (interquartile range) unless otherwise indicated.

Overall, total median costs from a second nonde /uniFB01 nitive pleural procedure to the end of follow-up were signi /uniFB01 cantly higher than the total median costs for de /uniFB01 nitive pleural procedures. These /uniFB01 ndings were consistent when evaluated for lung vs other cancers and across sites of care. Among patients who underwent thoracentesis for the second pleural procedure, costs for a de /uniFB01 nitive third procedure were lower compared with those of patients who underwent a nonde /uniFB01 nitive third procedure.\nThe reasons patients are not receiving guideline-based care likely are multifactorial. Access to care may be a barrier given that procedural expertise, anesthesia support, and special monitoring are needed for some de /uniFB01 nitive MPE treatments. 6 Patients seeking treatment at the ED or physicians ' of /uniFB01 ces may receive thoracentesis because it can be performed easily in an outpatient setting without extensive resources or training, dyspnea and pain are reduced almost\nimmediately, and the patient can return home shortly thereafter. 6 Patient and doctor preference and disease progression also may dictate the treatment for rapidly recurrent MPE. Patients with poor performance status will not be eligible for thoracoscopy, and some patients may not agree to de /uniFB01 nitive treatment based on their perceptions regarding quality of life associated with the treatments. These aspects are not captured in the dataset and are beyond the scope of this study 15,16 ; however, future research evaluating the reasons for recurrent MPE treatment selection are warranted.\nA strength of this study is the use of SEER Medicare data (2011-2015), which enabled ef /uniFB01 cient longitudinal analysis of large numbers of diverse patients cared for in the real world. 17 The burden of MPE is rising, given the increasing global prevalence of cancer and the availability of improved systemic therapies that prolong patients ' lives and potentially increase the numbers of patients experiencing MPE. 5,18 Clinical\nAccording to Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services cell size suppression policy, strata with n ¼ 10 are reported as < 11 and were suppressed to ensure con /uniFB01 dentiality of Medicare and Medicaid bene /uniFB01 ciaries.

This study helped to elucidate the real-world clinical and economic implications of different treatment pathways for patients with recurrent MPE.\nThe use of SEER Medicare data also has limitations because the purpose of the database is for billing and not speci /uniFB01 cally for research. As described earlier, claims databases lack clinical variables that could be important in accounting for differences among groups. Data for chest tube placement is based purely on Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services billing data, which do not fully capture patient care. Although we expect, based on clinical experience, that most of the patients with chest tubes had pleurodesis, only 15% had a code for pleurodesis. The true\nnumber of patients who had pleurodesis may be underestimated.\nPatients who undergo thoracoscopy will have better performance status, thus living longer and accruing more costs. We adjusted by calculating costs per day of life (Table 7); however, costs at the end of life are higher per day. 13 Treatments with shorter survival time will have lower total costs but higher per day costs because patients are closer to the end of life. Hence, unadjusted comparisons of total or per-day-of-life costs should be viewed as preliminary. g Regression models were /uniFB01 t to evaluate factors associated with costs after the second pleural procedure. Data were adjusted using an array of patient demographics, comorbidities, and disease history characteristics; however, other variables unmeasured may lead to residual confounding even after adjustment. Another limitation is that speci /uniFB01 c costs of the MPE and its associated management cannot be calculated because\nWe decided a priori to include variables that were associated at the 0.2 level in univariable analysis in the multivariable analysis. For the multivariable model, we used backward selection only to retain variables with a level of signi /uniFB01 cance of P < .05.

IPC ¼ indwelling pleural catheter; MPE ¼ malignant pleural effusion. a Total costs (rounded to the nearest dollar) were de /uniFB01 ned as the sum of all Medicare payment amounts for claims dated between the second pleural procedure and the end of patient follow-up (inclusive of both dates). Claims were pulled from the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review (inpatient), National Claims History (carrier), outpatient, home health agency, hospice, and durable medical equipment /uniFB01 les.\nb P < .0001 by Kruskal-Wallis test.\nc P ¼ .0007 by Kruskal-Wallis test.\n]\n(Continued)\nthis level of cost is not available in the SEER Medicare database. Prospective studies may assess the hypotheses that these analyses generated more accurately. This study is also limited in that the /uniFB01 ndings may not be generalizable to other countries or to all patients.\nDespite these limitations, these study /uniFB01 ndings may help to identify patients who would most bene /uniFB01 t from speci /uniFB01 c MPE treatments and potentially newer technologies, optimizing MPE outcomes and the associated economic burden of MPE.",
