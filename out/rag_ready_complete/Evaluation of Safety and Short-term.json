      "title": "Introduction",
      "content": "Therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy is performed to improve symptoms and quality of life in patients suffering from benign and malignant central airway obstruction (CAO)  [1].  Unlike  flexible  bronchoscopy,  rigid  bronchoscopy requires deep sedation or general anesthesia, typically with the aid of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) and mechanical ventilation [2]. There is no consensus regarding the optimal anesthetic approach to therapeutic interventional  rigid  bronchoscopy  in  adults  suffering from CAO.\nSome  anesthesiologists  continue  to  recommend  the use of general anesthesia and NMB for rigid bronchoscopy while others prefer spontaneous assisted ventilation (SAV). The rationale for the use of NMB is that it provides a 'quiet field' for the operator and complete control of ventilation by the anesthesiologist. Over the last decades, however, it has become evident that in patients undergoing a wide variety of surgical procedures, residual NMB is  a  contributing factor to adverse events including delayed discharge from recovery, need for tracheal reintubation, impaired oxygenation and ventilation, aspiration, atelectasis, and pneumonia [3-10]. These effects are likely mediated by decreased airway tone and impaired respiratory effort persisting during recovery from anesthesia [11,  12].  Despite  awareness  of  this  problem,  residual NMB after anesthesia remains a common adverse event and has been a focus of initiatives by the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation as recently as February 2016 [13]. With the introduction of neuromuscular blocker selective reversal agents (i.e., sugammadex), the concerns of residual NMB may no longer be justified in the near future; however, these drugs are not yet standard practice globally [14, 15] and were not used in our practice during the study period. In addition, intraoperatively, the use of NMB can  convert  a  critical  airway  obstruction  into  a complete obstruction due to expected central airway collapse, potentially resulting in an inability to visualize the residual airway lumen and leading to airway emergencies.\nOn the other  hand,  during  the  use  of  SAV  without NMB during these procedures, while the incidence of severe hypoxemia may be less frequent, the role of the anesthesiologist becomes more challenging as the depth of anesthesia must be continuously monitored and adjusted to balance patient safety and operator comfort. From a technical standpoint the procedure can be more challenging  without  NMB,  as  there  could  be  significant  movement of the target airway lesion during respiration. It is noteworthy,  however,  that  many  of  the  large  original\nstudies  evaluating  rigid  bronchoscopy  were  performed with SAV without NMB but the actual procedural or anesthesia-related complications were not the main reported outcomes [16-18]. In fact, in the last 25 years, only scattered  case  reports  and  small  case  series  have  been published on the role of different anesthetic techniques for rigid bronchoscopy in the adult population [19, 20]. Herein,  we  review  procedural  and  anesthesia-related complications in patients undergoing rigid bronchoscopy with total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and SAV at a single institution.",

      "title": "Discussion",
      "content": "Patients requiring therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy often  have  multiple  comorbidities  that  may  necessitate challenging anesthesia techniques to maintain airway and hemodynamic stability [19, 25, 26]. Many anesthesiologists  use  general anesthesia with NMB and mechanical ventilation during these procedures because of perceived improved control of cardiorespiratory parameters [2730]. Although the introduction of neuromuscular blocking drugs was groundbreaking in the 1940s, risks became apparent after years of clinical use. An older study found that 24.1% of patients receiving NMB developed hypox-\nData are presented as mean ± standard deviation of n (%).

In fact, mortality may be increased substantially during the perioperative period when these agents are used [31]. It appears that residual NMB during the immediate postoperative period is much more common than appreciated and may contribute to substantial morbidity, including the need for tracheal reintubation, impaired oxygenation/ventilation, impaired pulmonary function, increased risk of aspiration  and  pneumonia,  pharyngeal  dysfunction,  and delayed discharge from the recovery area [5, 7, 9, 12, 3236].\nData  are  presented  as  mean  ±  standard  deviation  or n (%). NMB, neuromuscular blocker; IV, intravenous. a An  individual case may have used more than one anesthetic agent, vasopressor, or mode of ventilation.\nASA, American Society of Anesthesiologists; CAD, coronary artery disease; CHF, congestive heart failure; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; DM, diabetes mellitus; OSA, obstructive sleep apnea.\nIn our study, despite our original attempt to complete the  procedure  without  the  use  of  any  intraprocedural NMB, in 19 out of 79 procedures (16.5%) we required the use of some period of NMB due to refractory coughing or biting, which impaired our ability to proceed with or continue the intervention. In these patients, intraoperative hypoxemia and hypotension were seen in 68.4 and 78.9% of patients, respectively; this was not significantly different than in those who did not receive NMB. Furthermore, although the number of patients is small, we did not find a significant association between the use of NMB  and  postoperative  respiratory  failure  or  30-day mortality. This is in agreement with the largest registry study to date on therapeutic bronchoscopy, though that study included both flexible and rigid therapeutic bronchoscopic  interventions  and  did  not  differentiate  between SAV and volume-cycled ventilation [37]. In previous studies on this topic, SAV was found to allow completion of a rigid bronchoscopic procedure with a low rate of postoperative respiratory failure, even in octogenarians and patients with a high ASA class [19, 20]. An older study on rigid bronchoscopy with SAV found that severe intraoperative hypoxemia occurred in 12% of patients (in that study hypoxemia was defined as an oxygen saturation of less than 90% for greater than 30 s or a saturation less than 85% for any duration) [19]. A more recent study reported intraoperative hypoxemia in 25.5% of  patients  undergoing  rigid  bronchoscopy  with  SAV [38]. In our study, the rate of intraoperative hypoxemia was 67.1%, markedly higher than the previous studies [19, 34]. One possible explanation for this disparity was our use of Nd:YAG and APC in 84.8% of our procedures, which requires lowering the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) to below 0.40 when applying these thermal ablative techniques. In the study by Perrin et al. [19], thermal ablation was utilized in 43% of the procedures and FiO2 was decreased to less than 0.50. In the study by Chumpathong et al. [38], thermal ablation was utilized in less than 25% of the procedures and the majority of patients were suffering from benign disease. Our study and these prior reports suggest that the use of thermal ablation, intervention for malignant disease, the placement of an airway stent,  as  well  as  preoperative  comorbidities  (e.g.  coronary  artery  disease)  increase  the  risk  of  intraoperative hypoxemia. Our study found that intraoperative hypoxemia, though common, was not associated with cardiac dysrhythmias  Odds ratio (or)  30-day  mortality  ( p =  0.658  and p = 0.658, respectively). This finding is consistent with the prior reports [19, 38]. We also found that the prevalence of intraoperative systolic hypotension was not associated\nwith 30-day mortality ( p = 1.0). Propofol was used in all our cases. Ketamine infusion preserves respiratory drive and airway reflexes and has profound analgesic properties, and was used in 20.3% cases at the discretion of the anesthesiologist. Opioids like remifentanil were used in most cases as they suppress airway reflexes, supplement sedation, and have good analgesic properties, allowing a safer procedure.\nIn regard to postoperative respiratory complications, we detected escalation in oxygen requirements or a need for positive pressure ventilation in 5.1% of cases; however, this was not associated with 30-day mortality ( p = 0.276). In our study the 30-day mortality rate was 7.6%, which  compares  favorably  with  the  AQuIRE  registry data which evaluated more than 1,000 patients undergoing therapeutic flexible and rigid bronchoscopy and reported a 17% 30-day mortality rate in patients who were managed with volume-cycled ventilation (which included the SAV patients) [37]. In our study, older age, inpatient status, pre-existing congestive heart failure, pre-existing home oxygen use, and the duration of the procedure were associated with 30-day mortality. The modifiable variable among these is duration of procedure, which, in our experience, correlates with the use of thermal ablation because of the intermittent need to reduce the intraoperative FiO2 to avoid airway fires. We believe this is relevant information for bronchoscopists and anesthesiologists alike as keeping the procedure as short  as  possible  should  become  a  goal  of  therapeutic bronchoscopy. Our study provides the evidence to justify  this  practice  and  potentially  make  the  duration  of procedure a quality care metric. Reduction in the duration of the procedure may be possible by using effective coagulation  tools  and  mechanical  debulking  and  not solely vaporization through the use of laser or superficial coagulation as achieved by APC. Alternatively, nonthermal ablation techniques may require less intraoperative time, but this hypothesis has never been tested in direct comparative trials. We believe our study is meaningful for the anesthesiologists involved in managing these patients with CAO as it adds to the body of literature that suggests  that  intraoperative  hypoxemia  and  hypotension, as defined in this study and others, did not result in an increase in intraoperative arrhythmias or mortality. The operators' focus should be on limiting the duration of  the  procedure  with  consideration  given  to  a  staged procedure, if warranted.\nWe also demonstrated that, despite the fact that 90% of patients had ASA class III or IV and the vast majority  suffered from advanced malignancy, there was no\nintraoperative  mortality  and  the  vast  majority  of  patients (94.4%) were discharged home. This is consistent with results from prior smaller case series [20]. These findings are relevant for thoracic oncology programs as palliative care is now routinely integrated in the management of patients with advanced cancer. Rigid bronchoscopy, however, should not be misperceived as too aggressive an intervention for this patient population. Therapeutic bronchoscopy in patients with airway obstruction from malignancy is an effective and safe palliative intervention and in fact was proven to allow deescalation of care in critically ill patients [39, 40], and can be used as a bridge to systemic oncologic care in patients who would otherwise not tolerate chemotherapy or radiotherapy [41]. Patients with symptoms from respiratory or cardiac complications of malignancy that are amenable to palliative procedures should be offered these interventions regardless of their disease stage or overall prognosis, as long as the palliative procedures can be safely performed without increasing the risk of death or prolonged hospital stay [42]. This is the case for malignant pleural effusion, pericardial tamponade, and  massive  pulmonary  embolism,  and  we  believe  it should be the case for malignant airway obstruction as well.\nLimitations of our study include the fact that it is a retrospective, single-center, single-operator study. We intentionally  limited  our  analysis  to  the  time  frame when sugammadex was not standard of practice at our institution,  and  we  only  analyzed  the  practice  of  one rigid bronchoscopist to minimize the bias related to intraprocedural  techniques  but  who  prefers  TIVA  and SAV to controlled ventilation and NMB. It is noteworthy, however, that even after the introduction of sugammadex, the economic benefits of this drug are unknown. One paper that considered this matter was a survey assessing patterns of practice and experience with sugammadex. It included 11,863 anesthesia provider respondents in 183 countries; 5,510 (46%) reported that sugammadex was available and relevant to their practice, but the majority of these providers (72%) reported selective  usage  of  sugammadex.  Most  (56%)  had  some form  of  restriction  on  sugammadex  access  primarily due  to  cost  [15].  Furthermore,  inadequate  recovery from NMB due to inadequate reversal with sugammadex, among other factors, continues to occur in practice [43].  A  direct  comparative  multi-institutional  trial could clarify the cost-effectiveness of TIVA with SAV versus  controlled  ventilation  with  NMB  and  reversal agents. Our sample size, while not robust, compares fa-\nvorably with prior reports on anesthesia for rigid bronchoscopy in adults [10, 19, 20]. Although our study did not show an impact of intraoperative hypoxemia and hypotension on postoperative complications, the definitions of these variables, while consistent with some other reports, are somewhat conservative. In our study intraoperative hypotension was defined as any systolic blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg at any time during the procedure, and we had a rate of 77% by using that definition.  This  is  substantially  higher  than  the  rate found in another recent paper; however, there was no criterion given in that paper as to what was considered hypotension [38]. Although controversial, we did not systematically use or report on the bispectral index in regard to guiding anesthesia technique; however, there were no reports of patient anesthesia recall, nor did we document the use or values of end-tidal CO2 levels.\nBased on the results of our study and prior reports, we suggest that future prospective studies evaluate anesthesia techniques for rigid bronchoscopy for the following: (1) the use of SAV versus volume cycled and jet ventilation with NMB and reversal agents (e.g., sugammadex); (2) the association (or causative effect) of the use of thermal versus nonthermal ablative techniques and mortality with the assumption that thermal ablation prolongs the duration of anesthesia which could directly impact outcomes (including mortality); (3) the association (or causation) between postoperative hypoxemia and/or respiratory failure and 30-day mortality; and (4) the association between intraoperative end-tidal CO2 and arrhythmias, hemodynamic instability, procedural time, time to awakening, time in the operating room, postoperative respiratory failure, and 30-day mortality.",
