      "content": "Enteral nutrition (EN) is the artificial nutritional support method of choice for malnourished patients or those at risk of malnutrition because it is more physiological, safe and cost-effective than parenteral nutrition and its only requirement is that the digestive tract be functioning normally. 1 Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is an endoscopic procedure whereby a plastic prosthesis is placed to administer EN through the creation of a gastrocutaneous fistula. It was first described in 1980 by Ponsky and Gauderer 2 as a less invasive alternative to surgical gastrostomy. Years later the option to radiographically perform it emerged, with success and complications rates similar to those of the endoscopic technique. 3 It is a safe and effective method to ensure nutrients are administered into the digestive tract of patients who have difficulty in orally consuming foods and fluids, 4 presenting some advantages over nasogastric intubation (NGI). 5",

      "content": "Administering nutrition through a PEG tube is carried out in those patients who require EN for more than four weeks, either temporarily in reversible diseases, or definitively in irreversible diseases, whose life expectancy is longer than two months and who have a preserved mental state 6 (Table 1). NGI feeding is usually reserved for cases requiring EN for a short period of time (less than 30 days) and when the patient's airway protective reflexes are intact. 7 Despite these general recommendations, the decision to place a PEG tube should be made on a per case basis and consider both the patient and their family's needs, preferences and expectations.\nThe high prevalence of oropharyngeal dysphagia and alterations in the feeding of patients with advanced dementia make this one of the main reasons for placing a PEG tube. 6 However, its effectiveness in these cases is not clear, and may even be considered futile and ethically unacceptable. It has been shown that PEG tube feeding in patients with advanced dementia does not improve survival, nutritional status or quality of life, nor does it decrease incidence rates of pneumonia due to bronchoaspiration or pressure ulcers. 8-10 On the\nMain indications for the placement of a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube.\nbasis of these data, some scientific communities, such as the American Geriatrics Society or the European Society of Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism, advise against its use in patients with advanced dementia in favour of careful oral feeding, 11,12 recommendations that are unknown to one out of every three doctors who deal with these patients. 13\nPatients with pharyngeal or oesophageal neoplasms with obstruction and dysphagia may benefit from this technique. Some studies have shown a clinical benefit of placing PEG prophylactically compared to placing it after the onset of symptoms, 14 although the available scientific evidence does not state an ideal time to place it. 15",

A history of previous gastric surgery supposes a failure rate of the technique of 28%. 16 Active infectious processes or those associated with a high risk of haemorrhage during and after the procedure (severe coagulopathy, portal hypertension with significant gastric varices) also contraindicate the procedure. 6 The presence of oropharyngeal or oesophageal stenoses the hinder the path of conventional endoscopes are considered relative contraindications, as well as pharyngeal or oesophageal neoplasms because of the risk of harvesting and dissemination of malignant cells. In these cases, the use of gastropexy can be used to place the gastrostomy catheter, leaving the surgical and radiological alternatives as second options 17 if the endoscopic technique fails.",

      "content": "The patient should fast for 6-8 h before the intervention to minimise the risk of bronchoaspiration. A previous study with blood count and coagulation, and a signed informed consent by the patient or their legal representative are required.\nEnsuring that there is no thrombocytopaenia (less than 50,000 platelets) or coagulopathy is essential, in order to avoid bleeding complications. PEG is considered a high-risk technique in terms of haemorrhaging, which is why proper management of antiplatelet\nDifferential characteristics of the two most frequently used techniques.\ndrugs and anticoagulants is necessary 18,19 (very frequently prescribed in patients with PEG indication), in addition to assessing the thrombotic risk according to the comorbidity of the patient. In those who have high thrombotic risk, bridging therapy with heparin is recommended after the suspension of acenocoumarol five days before, or suspending new oral anticoagulants at least two days prior. During the first 6-12 months after cardiac revascularisation, discontinuing antiaggregants (clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticagrelor), is not advisable: postponing the placement of the PEG tube and using other less invasive nutritional support is recommended. However, a recent meta-analysis found that there is no increased risk of haemorrhage with clopidogrel, even when taken together with acetylsalicylic acid. 19 In patients with low thrombotic risk, bridging therapy with heparin is not necessary, and antiplatelet agents can be discontinued, while maintaining acetylsalicylic acid. 18\nOn the other hand, prophylaxis with antibiotics before the placement of the tube effectively reduces the incidence of stoma infection. 20 Parenteral administration in a single dose one hour before the amoxicillin-clavulanate 1 g or cephalosporins (cefazolin 1-2 g, 1.5 g cefuroxime, ceftriaxone 1-2 g) technique is equally effective; the amoxicillin-clavulanic technique is recommended due to the increased risk of Clostridium difficile infection that leads to the administration of a single dose of cephalosporins. 21 Should the patient be allergic to penicillin, use ciprofloxacin 400 mg or clindamycin 900 mg in monodosis.",

      "content": "This technique is performed in an endoscopy room with a team of three health professionals (usually two endoscopists and a nurse), with the patient in the supine position and under aseptic conditions. In addition to locoregional anaesthesia, sedative drugs are usually used. Sedation by the endoscopist is performed in a manner similar to other endoscopic procedures, and its safety and\nefficacy have been proven even in populations with high anaesthetic risk (ASA III and IV). 22\nThere are basically three technical variants for the endoscopic placement of a gastrostomy tube (Table 3) 23-26 :\n-Pull, traction or Ponsky-Gauderer technique (Fig. 1): is the method of choice, given its low technical difficulty and complication rate compared to other techniques. 6 At the point of maximum transillumination and imprinting on the gastric body, a trocar is introduced and through it, a thread -which is grabbed using with a polypectomy loop and extracted with the endoscope through the patient's mouth. On the outside the catheter is laced onto this thread, and by traction from the created stoma, a catheter with a rigid or flexible internal retainer is placed through it.\n-Push or Sacks-Vine technique: similar procedure to the previous one, but with this method the catheter used is introduced by pushing from the oral cavity, attached to a long, semi-rigid and pointed tube, and by ensuring the guide remains taut, it is pushed through until it makes its way through the abdominal wall.\n-Introducer, gastropexy or Russell technique (Fig. 2): three pexis are placed, bringing the gastric wall closer to the abdominal wall at 2 cm from the maximum transillumination point, and a trocar is inserted into the centre through which a guide is introduced and several dilators are passed. After this, a balloon catheter is inserted and the sheath dismantled. These types of catheters have double lumen, one to inflate the balloon and another for feeding. They are recommended for paediatric patients and for patients who have advanced cancer of the head and neck or oesophagus.\nAll gastrostomy tubes have an internal retainer and an external retainer. There are also gastrojejunostomy or J tubes, that have a gastric and jejunal lumen, which allow decompression of the gastric cavity or administration of drugs in addition to feeding the patient. 27\nPrevious aspiration of secretions and disinfection of the oropharyngeal cavity is advised in order to reduce infectious complications; and performing a complete endoscopic examination to rule out obstruction of the digestive tract or other diseases that contraindicate the performance of the technique is recommended.",

The use of 30 ml or greater syringes prevent transmission of excessive pressure on tube components, minimising wear and\nbreakages. The patient must remain semi-incorporated during the administration of nutrition and up to at least one hour afterwards, in order to facilitate gastric emptying and prevent gastroesophageal reflux and bronchoaspiration.\nFollowing administration of nutritional formulas or diluted medications, or every 4-6 h for continuous infusion, instilling 20-50 ml of water to eliminate residues in the tube is necessary. The permeability of the tube is checked by aspiration of gastric contents; if there are residues exceeding 100 ml, reintroduce content and wait an hour before increasing the volume.",

The tube will be removed once the issue for which the catheter was indicated has been resolved and the gastrocutaneous fistula will seal in 24-72 h. However, in most cases the issue will persist or progress and periodic replacement will be necessary.\nThe first replacement can be performed percutaneously by traction of the tube, or endoscopically by grabbing the fastener in the stomach with a polypectomy loop. The removal of the tube by endoscopy is associated with higher rates of immediate complications, such that the percutaneous method is preferable, especially in the elderly and patients with oesophageal cancer or a history of head and neck surgery. Nonetheless, the endoscopic method is used in patients with a history of abdominal surgery, carriers of catheters with rigid internal fixation, or when the percutaneous method fails. 30 Once the old tube is removed, a balloon catheter is inserted through the stoma into the gastric cavity. These substitutions can be made by well-trained primary care personnel, thus reducing costs and transfers. 31",

It can also be secondary to a too rapid administration of food or feeding excessively high volumes. However, this complication can also occur in the long term, and is frequent in patients carrying balloon catheters.\nTreatment should begin with the optimisation of the nutritional status and medical factors and a review of the external fixation. The placement of larger-gauge gastrostomy tubes should be avoided, since they cause greater dilation of the stoma and route without promoting tissue growth or healing. 34 If the leak persists, the catheter can be removed in patients with a mature tract (more than four weeks after placement of the tube) while the guide is kept for\nanother 24-48 h -thus achieving a partial closure of the stoma -and reinserting the tube the same location. 38 If all of the above fails, the tube should be removed and the endoscopic procedure repeated in a location close to the initial one that meets technical requirements. 34\nIn the event that the leak occurs within the first four weeks of the placement of the tube, there is a high risk of peritonitis occurring when it is removed because of the immaturity of the tract.

Should this occur, the patient must be admitted, maintain an complete fast and initiate broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. The stoma should close in approximately 7-10 days before placing a new gastrostomy tube in the vicinity, or even in the same place as the previous orifice. 41 Other techniques have been described for the handling of partial closures, such as dilatations with a hydrostatic balloon or with Savary type dilators. 42\nWhen tubes accidentally come out of patients who have a mature tract (more than one month), a new tube can be placed without the need for an endoscopy, or a Foley 16-18 Fr can be temporarily placed to ensure the tract remains permeable until a PEG tube becomes available. In case of doubts about the correct positioning of the tube, studies with water-soluble contrast should be conducted.\nIn patients whose tubes come out frequently, placing button tubes could be considered to prevent this complication, following a reassessment of the need to continue carrying a PEG tube.",

It can be recognised by the appearance of oedema, erythema, pain and fever, with the possibility of developing bullae. It is associated with diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, neoplasms or immunosuppression, 52 as well as excessive traction or pressure of the tube on the gastrostomy orifice. 53\nTo prevent it, keeping the external fixator 1-2 cm from the abdominal wall is essential. 28 Treatment is based on broad spectrum intravenous antibiotic therapy and urgent surgical debridement.",

      "title": "Buried bumper syndrome (internal fixation migration)",
      "content": "Buried bumper syndrome is a very rare complication (occurs in 1.5-1.9% of procedures) 54 where the internal fixation device migrates out of the stomach, impacting on the gastric wall and the skin along the gastrocutaneous fistula. It usually occurs as a result of excessive tension between the external and internal fixations, producing ischaemia, necrosis and ulceration. 55 Avoiding tension between the fixators and rotating the tube daily can prevent it. It usually occurs in the first four months of using the tube. 56\nClinical manifestations depend on the depth of migration of the fixation, which can cause pain, inability to infuse food and pervaded extravasation of the nutritional formula, the latter being the most frequent manifestation. In addition, it can be complicated by haemorrhage, gastric perforation or peritonitis.\nDiagnosis is made by direct visualisation and subcutaneous palpation of the internal fixation, using upper digestive endoscopy in case of doubt, which will identify the internal fixation of the device buried inside the gastric mucosa. Carrying out a study with endoscopic ultrasonography or ultrasound is essential to confirming how it will be managed, as if the migration affects the gastric muscle itself, treatment must be surgical, or if not, endoscopic. To treat it, it can be pulled from the outside when it is a balloon catheter or flexible internal fixator. If the problem still persists, endoscopic removal would be indicated. For this there are different methods, such as dissecting the tissue that contains the internal fixation with a Needle-Knife Sphincterotome by making four radial incisions in the four quadrants, 57 argon plasma ablation, using the electrosurgical L-shaped hook HookKnife ® 58 (electrocautery) or using the push-pull T technique. 59\nTumour harvesting\nIn patients with oesophageal and oropharyngeal tumours, transfer and mechanical inoculation of tumour cells to the gastrostomy area have been described. However, the clinical significance of this complication is unknown due to the low risk of its occurrence (incidence less than 1%). In order to avoid it, using the Russell technique or the introducer method is suggested. 60 Upon suspicion, biopsy of the peristomal area and performing an abdominal CT is necessary.",
