Transbronchial cryobiopsy has become a popular method for obtaining tissue samples. Over the course of the last decade, there has been a signi /uniFB01 cant amount of research assessing the feasibility, safety, and diagnostic endpoints of transbronchial cryobiopsy in patients with interstitial lung disease.

Patient selection, procedural performance, and appropriate specimen handling are critical factors for success. A coordinated approach by pulmonologists with expertise in interstitial lung diseases, interventional pulmonologists, and thoracic pathologists is essential. In this evidencebased narrative review, we address transbronchial cryobiopsies from these three distinct perspectives. In addition, the current literature was used to address nine common procedural questions.\nKey Words: transbronchial cryobiopsy, interstitial lung diseases, cyroprobe, interventional pulmonology\n( J Bronchol Intervent Pulmonol 2021;28:81 -92)\nI nterstitial lung diseases (ILD) encompass a heterogenous group of conditions. They frequently represent a diagnostic challenge for clinicians who rely on a multidisciplinary discussion (MDD) to reach a consensus diagnosis based on clinical, radiologic, and occasionally, histologic data. Histology is not always required when evaluating a patient with ILD; when a biopsy is necessary, a\nvariety of approaches may be considered. 1 Traditionally, the gold standard for biopsy in ILD has been the surgical lung biopsy (SLB). Conventional transbronchial forceps biopsies (TBBs) can be performed for the evaluation of ILD, but their overall diagnostic yield is low. SLB for ILD has, however, been subject to increased scrutiny after several studies suggested prohibitively high morbidity and mortality rates. 2,3\nSince 2009, transbronchial cryobiopsy (TBC) has become an attractive minimally invasive option for the evaluation of ILD. It involves the use of cryotechnology to freeze and extract large frozen biopsy specimens. When compared to TBB, it allows for the procurement of larger pieces of tissue without crush artefact. 4 The multisociety Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) Clinical Practice Guideline acknowledged that SLB could be avoided in 80% of cases by performing TBC, but due to the lack of procedural standardization and heterogenous results across institutions, a recommendation for or against TBC could not be made. 5 Yet, even since the publication of these guidelines, data supporting TBC for ILD management continue to mount both qualitatively and quantitatively, and the practice is gaining acceptance across ILD centers. 6 Thus, the American College of Chest Physician ' s (ACCP) Guideline and Expert Panel Report recently concluded that TBC is a reasonable alternative to SLB for providing histology for ILD MDD. 7 Since the /uniFB01 rst report in 2009, the number of publications related to TBC has increased exponentially. 8 In general, they continue to support the procedure as a suitable, safer alternative to SLB. In this narrative review, we address the current data that support expert recommendations for TBC from the perspective of ILD pulmonologists, thoracic pathologists, and physicians trained in interventional pulmonology (IP).",

The diagnostic yield for a TBB in ILD is highly variable but can be as low as 20% to 30%. 11,12 In comparison, SLB provides larger samples (Fig. 2). SLB related mortality rates vary widely, 0% to 16.7%. 2,3,13 -15\nThe principal goal of a biopsy is to obtain an adequate amount of lung tissue while minimizing risk to the patient. Although TBB can be useful in speci /uniFB01 c cases, a signi /uniFB01 cant proportion of patients present with indeterminate radiologic /uniFB01 ndings and possible IPF. The identi /uniFB01 cation of the underlying histologic pattern generally requires large biopsy specimens.\nData supporting the use of TBC in lieu of SLB continues to accumulate. Studies have evaluated the purported diagnostic and procedural advantages of TBC over SLB contrasting diagnostic yield as assessed by -(a) independent diagnostic yield, (b) contribution to diagnostic yield when incorporated into MDD, and (c) direct comparison with SLB in the same patients -with safety outcomes (d).",

A ' diagnostic ' sample may range from nonspeci /uniFB01 c /uniFB01 brosis (ie, abnormal tissue) to clear features of a known condition such as usual interstitial pneumonia. Since the diagnostic gold standard of ILD diagnosis is MDD, studies that report diagnostic yields alone without MDD should be viewed with caution. 16\nNonetheless, systematic reviews and metaanalyses suggest that TBC has an acceptable diagnostic yield. Sethi et al 17 analyzed 27 studies that included 1443 patients. Overall, diagnostic yield of 72.9% was found for diffuse parenchymal lung disease. Data from Sharp et al 18 (11 studies, 704 patients) suggested a diagnostic yield of 84.4%. Johannson et al 19 (11 studies, 731 patients) showed that that the diagnostic yield for TBC ranged from 74% to 98% when interpreted in isolation, with a pooled estimate of 79%. A meta-analysis by Ravaglia et al 20 (15 studies, 781 patients) revealed an overall diagnostic yield of 81%. The weighted pool estimate for diagnostic yield in the 2019 ACCP Guideline was 82.5%. 7",

      "content": "MDD is a vital process in ILD management; sequential introduction of clinical, radiologic, and histologic information in a multidisciplinary context has been shown to improve interobserver agreement and diagnostic con /uniFB01 dence. 21 When clinical and radiographic data is inconclusive, histologic data is likely to be informative. In a study of 117 patients with /uniFB01 brotic ILD, the addition of histology from TBC to clinical, radiographic, and bronchoalveolar lavage data increased the prevalence of a highly con /uniFB01 dent IPF diagnosis from 29% to 63%. 22 The change in diagnostic con /uniFB01 dence by +34% was the largest of any individual step in the MDD process. In comparison, information from bronchoalveolar lavage and follow-up data had much smaller impacts on the prevalence of a highly con /uniFB01 dent IPF diagnosis (+13% and +17%, respectively). Similarly, incorporation of TBC sourced data had the most signi /uniFB01 cant impact in patients with a low con /uniFB01 dence IPF diagnosis. 22\nOther studies have corroborated these /uniFB01 ndings. In a prospective, multicenter study in which patients underwent sequential TBC and SLB, the addition of TBC sourced information was deemed useful in the MDD process in 75% (48/65) of patients. 23 In a systematic review and meta-analysis, the diagnostic yields for TBC ranged between 51% and 98% when reviewed within MDD. 19\nAlthough studies have shown that TBC can meaningfully contribute to the MDD, diagnostic\ncon /uniFB01 dence by MDD may not be the best metric to evaluate its utility. Indeed, experts may have high con /uniFB01 dence in the wrong diagnosis. 24 While a comparison between rates of diagnostic misclassi /uniFB01 cation has not been studied, data suggests that changes in diagnostic con /uniFB01 dence via MDD are similar between TCB and SLB. 22 While these limitations are recognized, MDD remains a critical step in the diagnostic pathway.",

Four observational studies that compare the diagnostic yield between TBC and SLB met inclusion criteria for the 2019 ACCP Guideline. 7,20,22,23,25 A summative outline of the studies can be found in Table 1. Two studies evaluated the concordance of sequential TBC and SLB in the same patient. 23,25\nOne earlier prospective comparative multicenter (2-center) study suggested poor concordance between sequential TBC and SLB. 25 A single, blinded, independent pathologist concluded that the histologic diagnoses for TBC and SLB were fully concordant in only 8 of the 21 cases (38% agreement). However, the use of a single histopathologist (blinded to clinical data and not a participant in MDD) substantially limited the interpretation of this data. 26 -32\nA larger multicenter (9 centers) and more robustly designed prospective study by Troy et al 23\nwas published in 2019. It established good concordance between TBC and SLB for both histologic pattern interpretation and consensus MDD diagnosis. 23 The study assessed 65 patients who underwent TBC, followed by immediate SLB. Samples were obtained from corresponding lobes of the same lung. They were masked and underwent independent assessment for histologic /uniFB01 ndings by 3 expert pathologists who had to reach an agreement. Clinical and high-resolution computed tomography (CT) /uniFB01 ndings were used to form provisional diagnoses, histologic data was added to arrive at a /uniFB01 nal diagnosis.

      "content": "When assessing endpoints such as death and ILD exacerbation, TBC appears to be the safer option. 20 Hospital length of stay is longer with SLB (6.1 vs. 2.6 d). 20 Mortality due to adverse events was higher in those who underwent SLB, compared to those who underwent TBC (2.7% vs. 0.3%). 20 The most extensive study of SLB in ILD analyzed over 32,000 admissions for patients with ILD who underwent SLB (via open or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery); it demonstrated an in-hospital mortality rate of 1.7% for elective procedures. 3 The rate was 16% if the procedure was performed nonelectively. 3 Ahigh (16.7%) 30-day mortality rate was also seen in a retrospective single-center study for patients who underwent SLB, who ultimately had a diagnosis of usual interstitial pneumonia. 33\nTBC mortality rates are lower, but also subject to high variability. Thirty-day mortality has been reported to range between 0% and 4.0%. 34,35 One report cited a 90-day mortality rate of 2.5%. 36 A meta-analysis showed procedural related mortality of 0.3% for TBC. 17 The 2019 ACCP Guideline estimated a mortality rate of 0.5% for TBC. 7\nTwo standard safety endpoints for TBC are pneumothorax and bleeding. It is a challenge to draw comparisons for these complications in SLB for several reasons. Rates of pneumothorax are arduous to de /uniFB01 ne since intraoperative chest tube placement is almost universal for patients undergoing SLB. 37 Amore feared and accurately tracked complication is a prolonged air leak. 15 Though more commonly seen in lobe or segment resections, they can occur in wedge resection. 38 Bleeding in SLB is infrequent and often minimal ( < 20 mL). 39,40 In comparison, the estimated incidence of pneumothorax and severe bleeding in TBC are < 10% and 0.3%, respectively. 7,17\nThe similarities in diagnostic yield, contributions to MDD, and diagnostic concordance, in combination with a superior safety pro /uniFB01 le, serve to suggest TBC is a better alternative to SLB.",

      "content": "Bleeding is a dreaded complication of TBC. A bleeding rate of 72.7% in 359 patients who underwent the procedure was noted in a prospective randomized trial. 64 There was moderate-severe bleeding in 16% of patients (n = 58). Prophylactic balloon blockers were not used in this study; cryoprobe size varied. In a retrospective study (n = 128 patients), moderate-to-severe bleeding occurred less when balloon occlusion was used (1.8% vs. 35.7%). 65 In another study, the protocol was modi /uniFB01 ed to include the use of a balloon blocker after 15 of the /uniFB01 rst 19 patients suffered either moderate or severe bleeding. After the procedural modi /uniFB01 cation (which also included a reduction of freezing time and reduction of biopsy number), there were no cases of moderate or severe bleeding among 42 patients. 70 Hetzel et al 49 recommend the prophylactic use of an endobronchial blocker when an ETT is used; they felt it was not mandatory in the setting of rigid bronchoscopy. The 2019 ACCP Guideline suggests that a prophylactic balloon blocker be used to block the segment feeding the target area in all TBC procedures. 7\nWe recommend that a prophylactic balloon blocker be used for all TBC procedures (1B,\nstrong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence).",

      "title": "What Is the Optimal Position for Cryoprobe Placement?",
      "content": "Selecting a cryoprobe placement location in TBC is a balance of bene /uniFB01 ts and risks: obtaining enough viable lung tissue in the target area versus bleeding and pneumothorax. Not all ILD affect the lung parenchyma uniformly; the cryoprobe must be placed in the affected area. 71,72 The area 1 cm away from the pleural roughly corresponds to the location of the secondary lobules of the lungs, which is the anatomic area of interest in a variety of ILD. 73,74 Cryoprobe-to-pleural distance is important. Too close to the pleural increases the risk of pneumothorax. A distance of < 1 cm from the pleural has been associated with a higher risk of pneumothorax. 75 Due to the proximity of the airways to large vascular structures such as pulmonary veins or bronchial arteries, too much distance from the pleura can lead to bleeding. 49 One centimeter is the approximate length of the metallic tip of the Erbe cryoprobe. 49 Most TBC studies describe the cryoprobe being positioned about 1 cm from the pleura. 76 The use of /uniFB02 uoroscopy may allow for more accurate cryoprobe positioning.\nWe suggest the cryoprobe be passed with /uniFB02 uoroscopic guidance till the resistance via the visceral pleural is felt, then retracted 1 cm before freezing is started (1C, strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).",

      "content": "Suggested freezing times have varied between 3 and 6 seconds. 77 -79 The minimum freezing time is dependent on the size of the probe that is used. Animal studies have shown that biopsy weight is directly correlated with both freezing time and the size of the cryoprobe. 80 Freezing time is also directly related to the cross-sectional area of the cryobiopsy specimen. 81 Other dif /uniFB01 cult to control for factors that may affect freezing time include pressure in the CO2 or nitrous oxide tank and lung tissue characteristics. Accordingly, a freeze test should always be performed in water to adjust the freezing time, and readjustment may be necessary after the /uniFB01 rst biopsy.\nBased on the current body of literature, we recommend a freezing time of three to six seconds for each tissue acquisition (2B, weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).\nCopyright r 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

      "title": "What Size Cryoprobe Should Be Used for the Procedure?",
      "content": "Cryoprobes exist in a variety of sizes and lengths. 82 Reusable /uniFB02 exible cryoprobes come in sizes of 1.9 mm (900 or 1150 mm length) and 2.4 mm (900 mm length). Single-use /uniFB02 exible cryoprobes come in 3 different probe sizes: 1.1, 1.7, or 2.4 mm. The cryoprobes can be paired with either nitrous oxide or carbon dioxide as a cooling gas. Carbon dioxide is a more commonly used cooling gas. 49,83,84 The 2019 ACCP Guideline recommended using the 1.9 mm probe. 7 Using the 1.9 mm allows for enough tissue to be obtained while having enough maneuverability within the 2.8 mm working channel. There is no difference in diagnostic yield between the 1.9 and 2.4 mm probe; data suggest a higher risk of pneumothorax with the larger probe. 68,76 Although the 1.9 mm probe can be placed through a 2.0 mm working channel, 2 critical limitations exist. The friction between the probe and the walls of the working channel makes the tactile identi /uniFB01 cation of the pleura a challenge. In addition, control of bleeding with the 2.0 mm channel is suboptimal.\nWe suggest a 1.9 mm cryoprobe be used when performing a TBC (2B, weak recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).",

In January 2020, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved the use of this smaller probe. 92 In addition, real-time imaging may mitigate complications an improve yield. A small retrospective case series described the use of radial probe endobronchial ultrasound to visualize and avoid areas with the vasculature. 93 Early studies using cone-beam CT-guided TBC have shown a low pneumothorax rate (1.9%). 94 Additional TBC research is undoubtedly warranted.

      "content": "In summary, TBC is becoming an increasingly popular procedure in ILD management. Over the last decade, it has been well studied, appears safer than SLB, and provides reasonable information for MDD. Appropriate patient selection is of utmost importance, and the potential risks must be appropriately balanced with potential bene /uniFB01 ts. Complications can usually be managed by expert and trained interventional pulmonologists.\nAs the use of TBC becomes more widespread, we anticipate the generation of more reliable data to guide future procedures. Nevertheless, the body of current literature prevents us from turning a cold shoulder to this minimally invasive, effective, and safe biopsy technique.",
