      "content": "The diagnostic approach to pleural disease remains an underappreciated aspect of modern thoracic medicine, despite the fact that pleural disease affects approximately 300 subjects per 100 000 population per year world wide. 1 Diagnostic and therapeutic thoracocentesis has been the standard initial intervention since the early 19th century. 2 Thefirst endoscopic inspection of the pleura was performed as early as 1866 and closed biopsy needles have been in use since the early 1950s. 3-7 Yet, the most efficient and cost-effective approach to pleural exudates remains uncertain and even controversial, particularly if acquisition of pleural tissue is required.\nThe clinician needs to consider various factors when confronted with the choice between closed pleural biopsy and thoracoscopy. These include the respective diagnostic yields of thoracocentesis, closed pleural biopsy and thoracoscopy in various clinical settings and pretest probabilities; the incremental gain in diagnostic yield when sequentially combining these investigations; and the supporting role of imagery of the pleura. Furthermore, local skill and expertise may ultimately dictate the choice. This review provides an overview of these and related issues, highlighting recent developments and controversies.",

This not only narrows the differential diagnosis, but also directs subsequent investigations and management.\nTransthoracic ultrasound (US) guidance improves the success rate of pleural aspirations. 8-10 In fact, the success rate of US-guided thoracocentesis can be as high as 97%. 11 USdetects pleural fluid septations with greater sensitivity than CT and also minimizes the risk of visceral puncture. 8,10,11 Moreover, the risk of pneumothorax following aspirations is reduced, independent of the size of the effusion. 12\nEmpyema, malignancy, tuberculous effusions, chylothorax, haemothorax and rheumatoid pleurisy are important examples of diagnoses that can be definitively established on pleural fluid analysis alone. 13 Apart from routine biochemistry, pH analysis, microbiology, cell counts and cytology, specific fluid test may be indicated in certain settings, for example, triglycerides and cholesterol in case of a suspected chylothorax or adenosine deaminase (ADA), stains for acid-fast bacilli and culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in case of suspected pleural tuberculosis (TB). Pleural fluid tumour markers currently have a limited role in the routine investigation of pleural effusions. 8,14",

Swiderek and co-workers suggested that a larger volume of fluid (60 mL) had a higher diagnostic yield than a lower volume (10 mL), 18 although others have concluded that a greater volume ( > 50 mL) had no increased yield. 19 Tumour type and availability of reliable immunocytochemistry may influence the yield. The cytological detection rate for adenocarcinoma is, for example, higher than that of squamous cell carcinoma, mesothelioma or lymphoma. 8\nThe usefulness of fluid analysis for pleural TB is dependent on the pretest probability for the disease, which will increase with a high local incidence of TB and high prevalence of HIV infection. In high incidence areas, more than 90% of all cases can be diagnosed following a single thoracocentesis based on the presence of a combination of a lymphocytic predominant effusion with a raised level of ADA. 20,21 Unstimulated interferon gamma levels in pleural fluid have a similar diagnostic accuracy as ADA. 22 Pleural fluid microscopy for acid-fast bacilli and pleural fluid culture for M. tuberculosis have poor sensitivities ( < 50%) for the disease. 8,20,21 The risk of false positives and overtreatment for TB in well-resourced healthcare settings is such that microbiological confirmation on pleural tissue is generally aimed for, that is, the diagnosis is not often made on pleural fluid alone, although it can be reliably excluded. 8\nThoracocentesis has varying diagnostic yields in other settings, and clinical correlation as well as pH and glucose measurements on the pleural fluid are often required, for example, in cases of rheumatoid arthritis-associated pleural effusions. 8",

      "content": "Although Gordon described the first in vivo inspection of the pleura in 1866, 3 Jacobaeus is credited with firmly establishing modern thoracoscopy in 1910. 23 Medical thoracoscopy is generally performed under local anaesthesia and conscious sedation in an endoscopy suite with basic monitoring. Surgical thoracoscopy, which allows for superior visualization, complete deflation of a lung and superior access for therapeutic interventions, is significantly more invasive and expensive. It requires general anaesthesia, intubation with a double lumen endotracheal tube and more than one port of entry. 24\nThere is considerable geographical variation in the use of medical thoracoscopy, even in the developed world. In Western Europe it is considered standard practice, 25 whereas only 12% of US training programmes offer medical thoracoscopy in their curriculum. 26 In the UK the procedure is still not uniformly performed, although there is growing interest. In fact, 2010 British Thoracic Society (BTS) pleural disease guideline state that thoracoscopy is the investigation of choice in exudative pleural effusions where a diagnostic pleural aspiration is inconclusive and malignancy is suspected. 8\nMedical thoracoscopy remains an invasive procedure, but complications are infrequently seen. Haemorrhage, secondary empyema and other major complications are only seen in 2-3% of cases, and death is exceedingly rare (0.4%). 8,27,28 Medical thoracoscopy has the important advantage that it may also be used therapeutically, for example, for the direct insufflation of talc in order to achieve pleurodesis and the breakdown of loculations. 8",

      "content": "Closed pleural biopsy requires careful local anaesthesia and should be a painless procedure. The main complication is pneumothorax. The large calibre of the Abrams needle combined with the patient's respiratory movements can allow outside air to enter the pleural space if the device is not kept closed at all times. This is often aided by falling intrapleural pressure during evacuation of pleural fluid. Pneumothorax with an underlying bronchopleural fistula can occur if the lung is punctured or otherwise injured. Although a pneumothorax may be seen in up to 15% of patients undergoing biopsies, only a small minority require intervention. 8 Other complications include site pain (1-15%), vasovagal reaction with potential syncope (1-5%), haemothorax ( < 2%) and site haemorrhage with haematoma formation ( < 1%). 8 The fall in the incidence of TB in most of the developed world over the last 50 years has led to an equally significant reduction in operator experience among respiratory physicians, 8 to the point where even experienced pulmonologists have become reluctant to utilize blind closed pleural biopsy even in settings where the anticipated diagnostic yields are high.",

      "title": "Image-guided closed pleural biopsies",
      "content": "Recent studies have proposed that image guidance may significantly increase the yield while decreasing\nthe risk for complications. Both transthoracic US and CT scanning have been utilized.\nTransthoracic US only came to the forefront as a guide to transthoracic interventions in the late 1980s, despite the fact that diagnostic sonography dates from the 1940s. 10,40-44 Transthoracic US is an ideal aid to the clinician, given its mobility, lack of irradiation and short examination time. 10,40 US is superior to chest radiography for the visualization of pleural effusions. Moreover, the volume of fluid, the presence of septations, pleural thickening, nodules and pleural based tumours can be accurately assessed (Fig. 1). 2 Modern mobile US units are cheap and available in practically all secondary and tertiary, as well as many primary health-care facilities, even in the developing\nworld. 10,40-44 Basic transthoracic US can be performed by means of the most basic entry-level twodimensional US equipment, which are more often acquired for obstetric use. A low frequency curvilinear probe (range: 2-5 MHz) is essential, whereas a high frequency linear probe (range: 5-10 MHz) is a useful addition. 40 Moreover, US-assisted pleural biopsy can be performed by a single operator with no sedation and minimal monitoring, even at the bedside. 10,40 The consumables (transmission gel, local anaesthetic, needles and syringes) are affordable. These simple yet practical considerations need to be emphasized when comparisons are made with thoracoscopy, which, despite superior diagnostic yield, is invariably performed in theatre under general anaesthesia or conscious sedation, necessitating significant expertise, resources and more costly consumables.\nIn a recent study, Qureshi et al . were able to identify 73%ofmalignant effusions on US appearance alone. 45 They found that pleural thickening > 10 mm, pleural nodularity and diaphragmatic thickening > 7 mm were highly suggestive of malignant disease.\nChang previously found the diagnostic yield of USguided Tru-cut pleural biopsy to be as high as 87% for all pleural pathologies (77% for malignancies), irrespective of pleural thickening or nodularity. 46 For malignant mesothelioma extending at least 20 mm in any accessible dimension on US we have shown that this figure may be as high as 100%. 47\nIn a recent prospective randomized study we found that US-assisted Abrams needle biopsy specimens were more likely to contain pleural tissue than specimens obtained by means of US-assisted Tru-cut biopsies (91.0% vs 78.7%, P = 0.015). 21 Furthermore, Abrams needle biopsies had a significantly superior yield for pleural TB compared to Tru-cut needle biopsies (81.8% vs 65.2%, P = 0.022), but not compared with previously reported figures for blind Abrams needle biopsies. The distribution of granulomatous inflammation in pleural TB is uniform over the pleura and visual aid therefore seemed to have offered little advantage beyond increased safety. Interestingly, and contrary to previous reports, the respective yield for both needle types for pleural malignancies was comparable and relatively high, with US-assisted Abrams needle diagnostic in 83.3%. 21 Wedid not utilize the US to specifically identify apparent diseased pleura, and did not limit biopsy sites to thickened pleura. One possible explanation for our relatively high yield, however, may be the fact that we utilized low biopsy sites, as the lower thoracic parietal pleura (close to the diaphragm) is more likely to contain secondary spread from visceral pleural metastases. Such an approach is possible with US assistance, but not with digital percussion as a guide (Fig. 2). Moreover, malignant disease tends to give rise to more focal pleural involvement, which may be discernable with US.\nApart from increasing diagnostic sensitivity, US mayalso add to patient safety. A recent survey carried out in the UK highlighted the dangers of blind pleural procedures: 67 of 101 National Health Service trusts reported at least one serious complication from intercostal drainage. In all, 47 cases of serious lung or chest wall injuries with eight deaths and six cases of\nintercostal drainage placement on the wrong side were described. 48 Although comparable multicentre data for unaided closed pleural biopsies do not exist, it seems plausible that similar complications can occur. Such incidents could be avoided by means of US assistance. 10,40 Recently there have been renewed\ncalls for formal instruction of basic transthoracic US skills to all respiratory physicians in training, and for some form of certification in basic competence in ultrasonography. 8,49,50\nThe contrast-enhanced thoracic CT scan of a patient with a pleural effusion (Fig. 3) may show focal areas of abnormal thickening. 8 A study by Maskell et al . found that CT guidance significantly increases the diagnostic yield in the setting of pleural thickening. 51 In their study CT-guided CNB had a sensitivity of 87%, compared with unaided Abrams needle biopsy with had a sensitivity of only 44% ( P = 0.02). Moreover, they concluded that primary use of CT-guided biopsy would avoid doing at least one Abrams biopsy for every 2.5 CT-guided biopsies undertaken, which needs to be considered where Abrams needle biopsy and CT-guided biopsy are equally accessible. 51 Adams previously found that CT-guided biopsies had a sensitivity of 93% for malignant mesothelioma. 52\nIn a very recent study, Metintas and co-workers randomly assigned 124 patients with effusions not diagnosed by cytology to undergo either Abrams needle biopsy guided by CT findings or medical thoracoscopy. 53 In the CT-guided pleural biopsy group, the diagnostic sensitivity was 87.5%, compared with 94.1% in the thoracoscopy group ( P = 0.252). CT-guided Abrams needle biopsy had a sensitivity of 95% in cases with pleural thickening ≥ 1 cm, which was on par with thoracoscopy (96%). Thoracoscopy was superior in cases with < 1 cm thickening (93% vs 82%, P = 0.42). The cause of the effusion did not influence the sensitivities. Few complications were reported. The authors concluded that CT-guided Abrams needle biopsy should be used as the primary method of diagnosis in patients with pleural thickening or lesions observed by CT scan (as was the case in the majority of patients enrolled), but suggested that patients with only pleural fluid appearance on CT scan may still benefit from primary medical thoracoscopy. 53\nComputed tomography scanning has the added advantage of visualization and guidance in areas not discernable with US (e.g. aerated lung). As a modality, however, it lacks the mobility of transthoracic US, and the input of a specialist (interventional) radiologist is generally required. 8 In some health-care systems, waiting lists for CT-guided interventions may also favour the use of US-assisted biopsy.",

      "content": "The estimated incremental gains in the diagnostic yields, respectively, for pleural malignancy and tuberculous pleuritis when sequentially combining pleural fluid analysis, image-guided closed pleural biopsy and medical thoracoscopy are summarized in Figure 4.\nMany authorities on the subject, including the BTS Pleural Disease Guideline Group, favour thoracoscopy as the investigation of choice in exudative pleural effusions where a thoracocentesis was nondiagnostic and particularly when malignancy is suspected. 8,24,29 Protagonists of this approach will point out the superior diagnostic yield (Fig. 4), relative safety and the ease of talc poudrage under direct vision. 8 Medical thoracoscopy, however, requires some degree of expertise and is often not offered at a District hospital level, necessitating referral to a centre with the capacity and experience to perform it.\nImage-assisted closed biopsy, on the other hand, can potentially be performed in most medical facilities, provided the operator is competent in imaging (CT and/or US) and closed pleural biopsy techniques, and offers a more rapid, more accessible and cheaper alternative, 10,21 albeit at the cost of a marginally lower yield. Local expertise, availability, cost constraints and the potential need to perform the biopsies outside of a radiology unit will likely dictate the choice between CT and US as the imaging modality. The pretest probability for malignancy or TB and image findings should also influence the choice of biopsy technique. Image-assisted biopsy is more likely to be diagnostic in the presence of pleural thickening > 10 mm, pleural nodularity, pleural based mass lesions of > 20 cm and solid pleural tumours. 11,45,47,53,54 Utilizing a relatively low supra-diaphragmatic biopsy site (Fig. 2) and acquiring at least six biopsy specimens may also increase the yield. 21,39 There is undoubtedly a need for large prospective studies to better define the role of image-assisted pleural biopsy, particularly for the diagnosis of pleural malignancy.\nTaking all of the above evidence into account, a case can be made for offering medical thoracoscopy as the principal investigation in health-care settings with\nlittle financial constraints and rapid access to the modality. This is in fact the current suggestion by the BTS, although only based on level C evidence. 8 In other settings (which arguably include most regions outside ofWestern Europe) a strong case can be made for offering a second image-assisted thoracocentesis and image-assisted closed biopsy to a patients with an exudative pleural effusion where the initial thoracocentesis was nondiagnostic, and to reserve thoracoscopy for those who remain undiagnosed.\n(a)\n(b)\n100\nFigure 4 The incremental gains in the diagnostic yields when thoracocentesis, image-guided closed pleural biopsy and medical thoracoscopy are performed in sequence.

Based on initial imaging, a patient may either have: (i) a mass lesion with an interface of at least 1 cm in two dimensions; (ii) diffuse pleural thickening ( > 10 mm) and/or nodularity; or (iii) insignificant pleural thickening.\nPleural based masses are ideally suited for US-assisted TTFNA, preferably with rapid on-site evaluation and US-assisted CNB. 47,54,59-62 In the\nabsence of a pleural based mass lesion, the choice of biopsy device and technique is best guided by the clinical setting. If the pretest probability for TB is high, an Abrams needle should be utilized (irrespective of pleural thickening), 21 and imaging should be used to improve safety. 10 In the presence of pleural thickening or nodularity, CT- or US-guided biopsy with either Tru-cut or Abrams needle of these areas of interest should be performed. 21,51,52 In the absence of overt pleural abnormalities, clinical context and local expertise should dictate whether an image-assisted biopsy should be used before thoracoscopy, as the value of image-assisted biopsy is less well defined in this setting (with the exception of suspected pleural TB). If utilized, an image-assisted low supradiaphragmatic biopsy with an Abrams needle is suggested, as it is more likely to harvest pleura. 21 Cases that remain undiagnosed after thoracocentesis and closed biopsy warrant thoracoscopy. It should be emphasized that these suggestions are not based on large multicentre prospective studies, but small single centre trials and expert opinion, 10,17,20,21,31,39,40,47,51-54 and that local expertise and ease of access to image modalities should dictate the approach.",

      "content": "Thoracoscopy has a superior diagnostic yield for pleural malignancy and TB, and is therefore considered by many to be the investigation of choice in\nexudative pleural effusions where a thoracocentesis was nondiagnostic and particularly when malignancy is suspected. Furthermore, it allows for the direct inspection of the pleura and for the potential direct application of talc pleurodesis when required. Access to thoracoscopy is, however, limited in many parts of the world, as significant resources and expertise are required.\nBlind closed pleural biopsy has a modest yield. Recent studies suggest that image guidance improves the yield, particularly for malignancy. An imageassisted second thoracocentesis combined with an image-assisted pleural biopsy with either an Abrams needle or cutting needle (depending on the clinical setting and imagery) may therefore be an acceptable alternative to thoracoscopy, particularly when there is a high probability of pleural TB. Cases that remain undiagnosed warrant thoracoscopy.",
