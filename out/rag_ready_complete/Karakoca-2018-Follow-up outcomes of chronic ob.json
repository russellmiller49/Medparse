      "content": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) is characterized by progressive air /uniFB02 ow limitations associated with a chronic in /uniFB02 ammatory process in the airways and lung parenchyma. In many Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, the pathological hallmark is in /uniFB02 ammation of the small airways (bronchiolitis). Increased volume of tissue in\nthe small airway walls, epithelial proliferation, squamous metaplasia, goblet cell hyperplasia, and the accumulation of mucous exudates in the lumen contribute to the narrowing of the lumen of the airways with a 3 to 8mm diameter by increasing wall thickness. [1 -4] The functional consequence of these abnormalities is air /uniFB02 ow limitation. Despite optimal pharmacological and rehabilitation therapies, a signi /uniFB01 cant percentage of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients suffer from symptoms of air /uniFB02 ow limitations, but interventional therapies are limited. [5 -7]\nRecently, we reported pathological and functional improvement with the Karakoca resector balloon equipped with a speci /uniFB01 c curettage/resection function that enabled the removal of the goblet cell layer in 10 severe Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients resistant to medical treatments.

      "title": "2.4. Karakoca resector balloon DC",
      "content": "Karakoca resector balloon equipment developed for cancer patients by Y.K. was /uniFB01 rst introduced to the medical community in the 16th World Bronchology Congress in Tokyo, Japan. It is manufactured in Turkey. It is a single-use, sterilized product available in 6 different dimensions (40 ∼ 25, 50 ∼ 30, 10 ∼ 10, 10 ∼ 15, 15 ∼ 20, and 15 ∼ 30mm). The design of the balloon enables an intervention at the tracheal level and the small bronchi as considered by the expert performing bronchoscopy. For a\n2\nsingle treatment session, an average of 2 to 3 balloons is needed. The Karakoca resection balloon equipment consists of a nonlatex balloon mounted onto the distal end of a double lumen polyethylene tube with a length of 120cm and outer diameter of 2.6 or 1.6mm. The balloon length varied between 10 and 50mm with a maximum in /uniFB02 ated diameter of 10 to 25mm. A mesh structure of 0.2mm thick polyurethane/Lycra (ENBIO MEDICAL, Istanbul, Turkey) /uniFB01 bers covered the balloon. The minimum diameter of the balloon was 1.7mm together with the mesh structure when de /uniFB02 ated.\nDuring the intervention, the /uniFB01 rst step was deep therapeutic aspiration with 3.2 and 2.0mm channel bronchoscopes. The DC was then started with /uniFB01 ber-optic bronchoscopy with the 3.2mm channelfromthe1/2distalofthe trachea toward the segmental and subsegmental bronchi. The balloon is inserted into the bronchial lumensothatthemucosalobstruction covers it, and it is repeatedly in /uniFB02 ated and de /uniFB02 ated until the lumen patency is established by an electronic pump in a regular pulse mode. The force applied directly to the bronchial mucosa via the balloon is approximately 2.5 to 2.0 bar, compressing the hyperplasic goblet cells.\nThe larger balloon used at the trachea and main and lobar bronchi provides 2.5 to 2.0 bar pressure, and a medium sized balloon used in segmental and subsegmental bronchi provides 2 to 1.5 bar pressure. For the 4 to 5 to 6 subsegmental bronchi, a 2.0-mm channel bronchoscope and the smallest balloon providing 1.5 to 1.0 bar pressure were used.\nAlthough the balloon pressure that thins the mucosal hyperplasia does not cause any lacerations or bleeding, the egested mucous material /uniFB02 owing into the bronchial lumen is aspirated to provide complete patency of the obstructed airways. Therapeutic aspiration is repeated after DC with 3.2 and 2.0mm channel bronchoscopes.\nBased on the recommended operating time decided by the preoperative cardiac evaluation, the number of treated segmental bronchi that could be accessed over 60 min ranged from 100 to 300 during the desobstruction in our cases, while it was 60 to 90 in our /uniFB01 rst 10 cases. [8] The procedure was performed using 3.2 and 2.0-mm inner channel bronchoscopes that provided access to 8 to 3-mm bronchi, those with most extensive goblet cell accumulation, along with the use of resector balloon maneuvers in 3-mm bronchi, which could be reached by a 4.1mm outer diameter bronchoscope. Segmental and subsegmental bronchi were viewed during /uniFB01 beroptic bronchoscopy, whereas therapeutic aspiration applied to patients with a mucous layer lining the entire mucosa and bronchoscopic biopsies were taken from the right inferior posterior segment to compare preoperative and postoperative pathologic /uniFB01 ndings based on the goblet cells and mucus accumulation.",

      "content": "Despite optimal pharmacological therapy and pulmonary rehabilitation, patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remain signi /uniFB01 cantly disabled. Although various interventional endoscopic techniques of lung volume reduction have been developed for Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), proper patient selection is required. [5 -7] A signi /uniFB01 cant percentage of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients have airway in /uniFB02 ammation. Bronchitis and bronchiolitis prominently contribute to air /uniFB02 ow limitation not only by narrowing and obliterating the airway lumen but also by actively constricting the airways. [9,10] Small airway disease and parenchymal destruction are the main structural abnormalities; low\nFEV1 values have been associated with an enlargement of bronchial smooth muscle and the accumulation of mucous exudates in the lumen of the small airways. [10 -13]\nIn a recent pilot study, we reported that DC with the Karakoca resector balloon provided speci /uniFB01 c curettage/resection of the goblet cell layer, thus increasing SpO2 and FEV1 in 10 patients. [8] In the present study, we focused on lung functions, quality of life, and exercise capacity. We treated 188 stage III/IV Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with chronic bronchitis and mixed Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Our results show improvements not only in SpO2 levels and lung function tests but also in effort capacity accompanied by the rapid relief of symptoms. The only unsuccessful result was that 3 of the ICU patients died in 2 months due to septicemia and heart attack. Except for these patients, we achieved symptom relief and improved lung function in all patients. Increase in FEV1 was found to be signi /uniFB01 cant at 1 week and 1 month after the operation; thus, exercise capacity and quality of life was signi /uniFB01 cantly improved. Two of the tracheotomized patients and 3 of the ICU patients were relieved of symptoms, and mechanical ventilation support was discontinued in the postoperative period. None of the patients developed complications within the postoperative 1 to 3 months of follow-up. We believe that appropriate selection of patients (patients with bronchitis and mixed Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) for this treatment yielded our successful outcomes. [8] The only patient who did not achieve symptom relief had a concomitant condition (i.e., emphysema pattern).\nExacerbation frequency was also markedly improved in the early postoperative period.\nGiven the recommended operating time determined by the preoperative cardiac evaluation, 100 to 300 segmental and subsegmental bronchi could be reached during the desobstruction in our case series. Nonetheless, it should be noted that the number of accessed segments within the operating time will increase with experience.\nIn conclusion, we achieved successful results in our 188 patients with stage III/IV chronic bronchitis and mixed Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treated with Karakoca balloon desobstruction, which is a safe and repeatable method. However, multicenter, larger scale, controlled studies are needed to provide further evidence of the ef /uniFB01 cacy and safety of the intervention.\nFEF = forced expiratory /uniFB02 ow, FEV1 = forced expiratory volume in 1 s, FVC = forced vital capacity, MBS = modi /uniFB01 ed Borg scale, SpO 2 = oxygen saturation, 6MWT = 6 min walking test. ∗\nPostoperative 1 week vs. postoperative 1 month.\nComparisons were performed by using Wilcoxon signed-rank test.\n4",
