In the last decade, the introduction of high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy has allowed for a better control of the neoplastic airway involvement and extend the duration of palliation [5,6]. This modality, alone or associated with laser debulking, seems able to achieve the desirable objectives of each palliative treatment: it is easy, quick, effective and mini-invasive [1,5,7-10]. If compared with low dose rate (LDR) method, and with the same efficacy [5,11,12], HDR brachytherapy has allowed to reduce the treatment time, program with more accuracy the dose distributions and reduce radiation exposure to personnel. Moreover, the great variability of the series reported in literature, about the technique utilized for the treatment and the population involved in the study, has not until now allowed a complete evaluation of the poten-\ntials of this method [13]. With the aim of verifying these potentialities, the efficacy of the combined Nd-YAG laser : HDR brachitherapy versus bronchial debulking with Nd-YAG laser alone was evaluated, in a prospective randomized study treatment.",

The protocol was approved by the Hospital Ethical Committee and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. From December 1995 to December 1998, we enrolled 29 patients with Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who had already undergone a previous conventional treatment (11 with surgery followed by external beam radiation therapy, 18 with chemo : radiotherapy). The patients were randomized in two groups. Fifteen patients (Group 1) underwent Nd-YAG laser debulking only and 14 (Group 2) laser debulking followed by HDR brachytherapy. There were 23 males and six females with a mean age of 61 years (range 47-76). Twenty-one patients had a squamous cell carcinoma, six had an adenocarcinoma and two an undifferentiated large cell carcinoma (Table 1). The lesion involved the trachea in six cases, the carina and both mainstems in six, the carina and a mainstem in seven, a mainstem in seven and a lobar bronchus in three (Table 2). Airway obstruction grade was calculated according to Speiser's obstruction score method [12] (Table 3).",

A significant improvement of forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), of forced vital capacity (FVC) and of the ratio between the forced expiratory and inspiratory flow at 50% of vital capacity (FEF50 : FIF50 ) was measured in group 1 patients. The same way, arterial blood gas analysis showed an increase of PaO2. Group 2 patients showed a further improvement of these parameters but without statistical significance (Table 5).\nAfter laser debulking, Speiser's index dropped from 6.8 to 3.0 ( P B 0.001) in group 1 patients. HDR brachytherapy allowed a further reduction of the obstruction score (not statistically significant) and a complete endoscopic clearance of the lesion in eight of 12 patients (66.6%). In seven of these cases bronchial biopsies showed a complete anatomicopathological disappearance of the disease. At follow-up, these results supported the statistical difference between the two groups both for the period free from disease progression (7.5 9 1.6 months for the combined treatment versus 2.2 9 0.4 months for laser debulking alone, P B 0.05) and for the number of further endoscopic treatments, Nd-YAG or stent (3 vs. 15, P B 0.05).

      "content": "Forty percent of patients with advanced lung cancer have an intrathoracic relapse in spite of a first line treatment based on external beam irradiation only or associated to surgery and : or chemotherapy [17-19]. The planning of a therapeutic strategy is particularly difficult in these patients, both for the limited options of treatment and for the significant manifestations related to the tracheobronchial involvement. The patient, who previously underwent external beam irradiation, in fact, cannot profit by such treatment again because of the overcoming of tissue tolerance threshold [20-22]. In these cases Nd-YAG laser debulking allows an immediate improvement of pulmonary symptoms [2-4]. But the necessity of repeated treatment reduces the quality of life of the patient and increases health costs [4]. Schray and Suh's retrospective study [9,23] underlined how laser debulking followed by brachytherapy prolonged airway opening and symptoms palliation. Other authors stressed the high risk of complications associated to the combined treatment and contested the real therapeutic effectiveness [20,21,24,25]. The authors were intrigued to conduct a randomized prospective study with the expectation to assess the real significance of combining NdYAG laser with HDR brachytherapy treatment.\nSymptom control was excellent in both groups of the study - an improvement in 100% of patients was obtained with hemoptysis and stridor, and in 70% of patients with dyspnoea in agreement with literature [26-29]. The same has been reported about objective response regarding either pulmonary function tests or endoscopic findings (Speiser's Index) [8,12]. As could be expected, a statistically significant difference was found at follow-up with a period free from symptoms and progression which was longer in the second group [9,23]. No early complications were experienced in either group. Late complications, related to brachytherapy, were acceptable\nand no mortality related to the treatment was experienced.\nProbably, several factors contributed to achieve such results. In most of the cases, debulking was carried out mechanically by the blade of the rigid bronchoscope and Nd-YAG laser utilized for hemostasis by tangential beams to the bronchial wall, reducing the risks of a direct perforation. Moreover, according to Zajac, Nori and Kohek [30-32], brachytherapy started at least 2 weeks after laser debulking and each patient underwent three afterloading sessions at weekly intervals with an endobronchial irradiation dose of 5 Gy per session, observing absolute limits of safety. Besides, recent data published by Macha [33,34] has reassessed the risk of massive hemoptysis following the combined treatment. He analyzed the high percentage of mortality associated with this complication, reported by several authors [20,21,24,25], and suggested it could be attributable to the type and topography of the treated lesions, rather than to a direct effect of the treatment. Furthermore, an extension of survival in patients with a central invasive tumor may explain the enhancement of the probability of a fatal hemoptysis.\nThe efficacy of the palliative endoscopic treatment has now been largely assessed and currently it seems to be an important factor in the increasing attention paid by clinical oncologists to the quality of life in patients with advanced disease. The findings confirm again the benefit of brachytherapy in stabilizing the effect of laser debulking and prolonging the improvement in symptoms, but also reducing the necessity of further endoscopic interventions and, as a consequence, the mean costs of treatment per patient. This is the same for those patients who already underwent an external beam radiation treatment [27,31].\nAlthough Nd-Yag laser debulking and endobronchial afterloading can only be regarded as palliative methods, it could be considered a standard procedure for non-resectable Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) of the central bronchial tree thanks to its low invasive nature and the feasibility of performing it on an outpatient basis.",
