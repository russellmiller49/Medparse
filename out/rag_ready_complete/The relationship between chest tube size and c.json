The questionnaire inquired about pain during chest tube insertion,  while  the  tube  was in  situ ,  and  during  tube  removal.  For each  pain  component,  the  questionnaire  was  completed  at  the end of the event (immediately after tube insertion; at the end of the  period  with  the  chest  tube in  situ ,  just  before  chest  tube removal;  immediately  after  tube  removal).

In addition, clinical criteria at  baseline 27 that  are  associated  with  poor  prognosis include a raised urea level, increasing age, a low albumin level, low diastolic blood pressure, and hospitalacquired infection (  Table 1  ). There were no signifi  cant differences between tube size groups in these parameters, except for the baseline albumin level (  Table 1  ).\nLogistic  regression  was  used  to  adjust  for  differences in baseline covariates known to predict mortality in the analysis of the primary end point. 26,27 After adjustment, there remained no relationship between chest tube size and mortality or surgery ( P value for contribution to the model by tube size 5 .96).\nData include the frequency of markers of increased mortality 26,27  (please refer to 'Effi  cacy Analyses' section   for further explanation). Signifi  cant differences  are  highlighted  and  discussed  in  the  'Results'  section.  Results  here  based  on  the  totals  available.

Statistical signifi  cance is x 2 , 3 df 5 303; P , .001.\nAdverse Event Analyses: Overall pain scores were higher  in  patients  treated  with  larger-size  chest tubes (size , 10F, median pain score [MPS] 6 [range 4-7]; size 10-14F, MPS 5 [4-6]; size 15-20F, MPS 6 [5-7];  size . 20F,  MPS  6  [6-8]; x 2 ,  3 df 5 10.80, P 5 .013, Kruskal-Wallis; x 2 trend, 1 df 5 7.29, P 5 .008). Pain scores were higher in those treated with blunt-dissection-inserted tubes compared with guide-wire-inserted tubes (blunt dissection MPS 7, interquartile  range  [IQR]  5-9;  guide  wire  MPS  5, IQR  3  to  8;  Mann-Whitney U test, P 5 .006). Because  the  size  of  the  drain  inserted  and  the insertion  technique  were  highly  correlated  ( x 2 , 3 df 5 303, P , .0001), no further separate analysis of insertion technique (as opposed to tube size) was conducted.\nThe greater pain caused by larger-size tubes was the  result  of  increased  pain  during  the  insertion of the tube and pain while the tube was in situ , with no  pain  difference  during  tube  removal  (insertion: size , 10F,  MPS  2  [IQR  1-2];  size  10-14F,  MPS  2 [IQR 1-3]; size 15-20F, MPS 2 [IQR 1-3]; size . 20F, MPS 2, [IQR 2-3]; x 2 , 3 df 5 8.12, P 5 .044, KruskalWallis; x 2 trend,  1 df 5 7.2, P 5 .009. in situ :  size , 10F, MPS 2 [IQR 1-3];  size  10-14F,  MPS  2  [IQR  1-2]; size 15-20F, MPS 2 [IQR 2 to 3]; size . 20F, MPS 2\nwas no difference found in the outcomes (data not shown).\nSecondary  Analyses: There  was  no  difference  at the  5%  level  in  the  frequency  of  death  or  surgery alone, length of hospital stay postrandomization, or FEV 1 , FVC, or residual chest radiograph abnormality at 3 months in groups treated with tubes of varying size  (  Table  3  ).  The  method  of  chest  tube  insertion was  not  associated  with  any  differences  in  clinical outcome (  Table 4  ).\nSubgroup Analysis: There was a statistically significant difference in the frequency with which patients either died or required thoracic surgery at 12 months in the groups receiving chest tubes of varying size in patients with purulent pleural fl  uid, favoring smaller size  tubes  (purulent  fl  uid:  size , 10F,  No.  dying  or needing  surgery  12/42  [29%];  size  10-14F,  55/164 [34%];  size  15-20F,  25/58  [43%];  size . 20F,  29/65 [45%]; x 2 trend, 1 df 5 4.3, P =  .04.).

See Table 1 for expansion of the abbreviations.\nthose  receiving  5  mg  intravenous  morphine  after major surgery, 28   where 31% of patients given a placebo experienced clinically signifi  cant pain that could have been avoided by the use of morphine. The chesttube-pain difference is also similar to the difference in pain   intensity after receiving a placebo or strong nonsteroidal analgesia for abdominal/pelvic 29 or major orthopedic 30  surgery.\nIt  is  possible  that  the  tube  insertion  technique is associated  with  different  amounts  of  experienced pain (eg, blunt dissection insertion causes more tissue trauma). Because the insertion technique (guide wire or blunt dissection) is closely coassociated with tube size ( x 2 , 3 df 5 303, P , .0001), it is not possible to establish from this data whether the difference in pain intensity relates to the size of the tube, the technique of insertion, or both. Specifi  c studies assessing insertion technique, tube size, and pain are required to defi  nitively answer this question.\nA  potential  limitation  to  the  pain  results  here demonstrated is that not all patients were able to complete the pain questionnaire. This study did not specifi  cally  record the number of patients in whom the pain questionnaire was offered who were 'too unwell' to complete it. However, this number is likely to have been small and not likely to have materially altered the signifi  cance of the results here demonstrated.\nA general change to the use of smaller-sized tubes might not be appropriate if there was evidence for a therapeutic  benefi  t  from  using  larger  tubes.  From our  data,  there  is  no  suggestion  of  any  therapeutic disadvantage associated with smaller-size tubes (  Fig 1  ).\n[IQR 2-3]; x 2 , 3 df 5 11.75, P 5 .008, Kruskal-Wallis; x 2 trend,  1 df 5 6.2, P 5 .015.  removal: size , 10F, MPS 2 [IQR 1-2]; size 10-14F, MPS 1 [IQR 1-2]; size 15-20F, MPS 2 [IQR 1-2]; size . 20F, MPS 1 [IQR 1-2]; x 2 ,  3 df 5 2.7, P 5 .44,  Kruskal-Wallis; x 2 trend,  1 df 5 1.0, P 5 .31 (  Fig 2  ).\nThere was no signifi  cant difference in the frequency with which tubes were displaced from the chest ('fell out')  between  chest  tube  sizes  (size , 10F,  No.  displaced  3/16  [19%];  size  10-14F,  14/61  [23%];  size 15-20F,  0/19 [0%]; size . 20F, 4/23 [17%]; x 2 , 3 df 5 5.02, P 5 .18).

The results demonstrate that in a large cohort of patients with pleural infection treated with a range of chest tube sizes and different  insertion  techniques,  smaller-size  tubes, 14F  or  smaller  (mostly  guide-wire  inserted),  cause much less pain than larger-size tubes (mostly bluntdissection  inserted),  without  impairing  clinical  outcome. Should these results  be  borne  out  in  randomized prospective studies, these data suggest that a change to smaller-size tubes would substantially reduce the pain experienced by patients being treated for pleural infection, without reducing effi  cacy. Randomized studies  prospectively  assessing  tube  size  effi  cacy, tube placement technique, and pain in the treatment of pleural infection are now required.",

Ms  Hedley: contributed  to  data  collection  and  manuscript preparation and approved the fi  nal manuscript.\nMr  Nunn: contributed  to  statistical  analysis  and  manuscript preparation and approved the fi  nal manuscript.\nComparing the rate of surgery or death in those treated with a tube size , 15F (36%) with those treated with a size . 15F (41%), an advantage to the use of the larger size of 5% can be excluded with a 95% CI. Because the combined mortality and surgery rate at 12 months is 38%,  2  this implies that if there is an advantage to large-size tubes, the number of patients needing to be treated with a large-size tube to prevent one death Odds ratio (or) operation is at least 50 (95% CI).\nWe have assessed whether the known risk factors predicting  mortality  in  patients  with  empyema 26,27 might have confounded this analysis. The only mortality predictor that was associated with tube size was serum albumin, with a lower albumin level in those patients  with  larger-size  tubes  (although  this  result may  have  arisen  by  chance).  Logistic  regression adjusti  ng  for  these  known outcome predictors does not change the result of the primary analysis.\nThe clinical outcome data available for this cohort has also allowed the exploration of the effect of tube size and insertion technique on hospital stay, dynamic lung function, and chest radiograph abnormality after recovery. Again, there is no suggestion of a differential outcome in any of these variables.\nThe subgroup analysis of the frequency of death or surgery  in  patients  with  purulent  pleural  fl  uid  or complicated parapneumonic effusion also shows no advantage to an increasing chest tube size.  In  fact, there is a small advantage to the use of smaller-size tubes  in  patients  with  frankly  purulent  fl  uid.  This result provides some support for the use of the smallersize (often image guided) drainage technique advocated elsewhere, 10,11,15,16,18,19,31-34 although the statistical signifi  cance  of  this  relationship  is  only  borderline ( P 5 .04),  especially  given  the  multiple  tests  conducted here. Whether there truly is an advantage to smaller-size tubes, these data are reassuring in that there is no disadvantage to their use. Although not recorded for the purposes of this study, placement of smaller-sized chest tubes under image guidance may contribute to the effi  cacy in clinical outcome demonstrated here.\nTo our knowledge, this is the fi  rst  study  to  produce  comparative  data  comparing  efficacy  and adverse  events  in  different  tube  sizes  in  pleural infection. Two smaller studies in abdominal   abscesses were previously reported, 14,17   and these reports are consistent  with  our  results,  showing  no  advantage from drainage with larger tubes. Previous studies in pleural  infection  regarding  subjects  treated  with  a range of chest tube sizes did not explore the effect of these differences on clinical outcome, 13,35-44  with the excep  tion  of  Thomson  et  al, 45   where  smaller-size tubes were associated with a shorter hospital stay in pediatric patients with pleural infection, suggesting a possible advantage in favor of smaller-size tubes in\n15  .
