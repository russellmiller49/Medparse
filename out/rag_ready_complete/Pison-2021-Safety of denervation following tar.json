The AIRFLOW-1 study assessed safety and TLD dose in patients with moderate-to-severe, symptomatic Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This analysis evaluated the long-term impact of TLD on Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations, pulmonary function, and quality of life over 3 years of follow up. Methods: TLD was performed in a prospective, energy-level randomized (29 W vs 32 W power), multicenter study (NCT02058459). Additional patients were enrolled in an open label confirmation phase to confirm improved gastrointestinal safety after procedural modifications. Durability of TLD was evaluated at 1, 2, and 3 years post-treatment and assessed through analysis of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations, pulmonary lung function, and quality of life. Results: Three-year follow-up data were available for 73.9% of patients (n = 34). The annualized rate of moderate to severe Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations remained stable over the duration of the study. Lung function (FEV 1 , FVC, RV, and TLC) and quality of life (SGRQ-C and CAT) remained stable over 3 years of follow-up. No new gastrointestinal adverse events and no unexpected serious adverse events were observed. Conclusion: TLD in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients demonstrated a positive safety profile out to 3 years, with no late-onset serious adverse events related to denervation therapy.

      "content": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by persistent limitation of airflow and  respiratory  symptoms  resulting  from  abnormalities in  the  lungs  at  the  level  of  the  alveoli,  airways,  or  both [1,  2].  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  exacerbations  are  associated  with  high\ncosts,  poor  clinical  prognosis,  increased  morbidity  and increased mortality; therefore, reducing the risk of exacerbations in the Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) population is an important treatment goal [1, 3, 4].\nThe  pathophysiology  of  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  is  characterized  by increased  autonomic  nervous  system  input  to  the  lung and  sensory  signaling  from  the  lung  mediated  by  the vagus nerve. Increased parasympathetic  input raises cholinergic  tone  in  the  airways  which  modulates  airway smooth muscle tone, airway hyperresponsiveness,  inflammation  and  mucus  hypersecretion  [5-7]. Thus, one of the cornerstones of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) pharmaceutical\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nmanagement is to reduce symptoms by blocking cholinergic signaling with anticholinergic agents. Anticholinergic agents relax airway smooth muscle, decrease mucus hypersecretion,  and  improve  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-related  symptoms [1, 8].\nMedical therapy has limitations and leaves significant unmet needs for Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients [1, 9-11]. Patient compliance  to  prescribed  inhaled  medications  and  optimal deposition of medication into the lung periphery remain challenges  [12].  Acute  changes  in  lung  physiology  due to  infections/inflammation  overwhelm  the  therapeutic effect  of  inhaled  medications  [13].  As  a  result,  patients continue  to  exacerbate  while  on  medical  therapy,  with only  about  50%  of  patients  treated  with  a  long  acting muscarinic  antagonist  experiencing  a  clinically  significant benefit [14] and up to 70% of patients experiencing a Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation while on optimal medical therapy [11].\nTargeted  lung  denervation  (TLD)  is  a  novel  bronchoscopic therapy that interrupts parasympathetic pulmonary nerve input to the lung to reduce clinical consequences of cholinergic hyperactivity [15-17]. Previous research of TLD has established an optimal dosing strategy and the safety of the procedure [16, 18]. This study presents the long-term impact of TLD on Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations,  symptoms,  quality  of  life  and  pulmonary  function at 3 years post-TLD as observed in the AIRFLOW-1 clinical trial.",

      "content": "Briefly, TLD therapy is delivered via a dual-cooled radiofrequency  (RF)  catheter  (Nuvaira,  Minneapolis,  Minnesota, USA) designed to target tissue heating at depth, thereby producing a narrow band of ablation around the main bronchi while minimizing effects to the inner surface  of  the  airway.  As  RF  current  passes  from  the  electrode through the airway and surrounding tissues, these tissues are heated. Coolant continuously circulated through the electrode and balloon removes heat from the surface of the airway wall. The net effect is targeted tissue ablation at depth with minimal heating and damage of the inner surface of the airway [15-17].\nAIRFLOW-1  was  a  randomized  (1:1)  double-blind multicenter  study  (NCT02058459)  of  30  patients  with moderate-to-severe symptomatic Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that underwent TLD at 29 W (n = 15) or 32 W (n = 15) power. An additional 16 patients were treated with 32 W power, associated with optimal improvements in   FEV 1 and  SGRQ-C, after  randomization  as  an  open-label  group  to  confirm safety improvements after procedural enhancements following  gastrointestinal  adverse  events  during  the  randomized part of the trial [16]. Detailed descriptions of the study methodology have been previously published [16].\nAll patients signed a written informed consent form, and study  approval  was  obtained  from  local  ethics  committees and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (1996),  Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and any local requirements.\nGastrointestinal events were reported during the randomization phase, which led to procedural modifications and a subsequent reduction in treatment-related gastric side-effects in the open-label phase [16]. The procedural change was the addition of esophageal balloon placement allowing  the  physician  to  visualize  the  esophagus  and fluoroscopically measure the distance between the radiofrequency (RF) electrode and the esophagus. Additionally, a treatment plan was developed to lower the energy dose depending on proximity to the esophagus.",

      "title": "Discussion",
      "content": "These data add to previously published research on the safety  and  feasibility  of  the  TLD  procedure  [15-18]. Three  years  of  follow-up  demonstrate  a  positive  longterm safety profile, and no new GI-related SAEs related to  the  procedure  or  device  over  the  2nd  and  3rd  year of  follow  up.  Patients  treated  with  TLD had stable lung function and symptom levels at 3 years post treatment.\nA  previously  published  TLD  clinical  study  using  an earlier  version  of  the  device  not  yet  compatible  with flexible  bronchoscopy also followed subjects for 3 years of  follow-up  [17].  Both  long-term  studies  utilizing  different  generation  devices  and  associated  doses  yielded results  supporting  favorable  long-term  safety.  In  addition,  the  absence  of  unexpected  severe  adverse  events\nin  the  confirmation  group indicates that the procedural modifications to fluoroscopically measure distance from the esophagus did not result in any unanticipated adverse events during later years [16].\nIt  is  well  established  that  lung  function  in  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients continues to decline with progression of the disease.  Prior  longitudinal  studies  across  a  wide  range  of GOLD  stage  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  patients  has  consistently  reported an  average  annual  rate  of  decline  in    FEV 1 and  FVC  to be ~ 30 mL/year and ~ 40 mL/year respectively [19, 20]. Annual decline  in    FEV 1 specific  to  GOLD  Stage  II  and III  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  patients  has  been  reported  to  range  from ~ 40-80 mL/year and ~ 30-60 mL/year respectively [21, 22].  Similarly,  decline  in  patient  reported  quality  of  life measures have been reported in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with an average  yearly  increase  in  SGRQ-C  of  1.2  to  1.8  points being reported [19, 23].\nPrevious TLD  clinical studies have demonstrated potential  positive  impacts  on  lung  function  and  quality of life measures in patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [15-18]. The current results suggest that these impacts on lung function and  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  symptoms  remained  largely  stable  over  the 3 years of follow up. At 3 years post-treatment, measures of lung function   (FEV 1 , FVC, RV, and TLC) and quality of life (SQRG-C and CAT) on average were similar to baseline measures and absent of significant declines.\nFollow-up  bronchoscopy  was  performed  at  3  months post-treatment  checking  for  presence  of  adverse  reactions  within  the  airways  such  as  narrowing,  stenosis, fibrosis,  etc.  Although  no  follow-up  bronchoscopy  was performed at later time points, stability of lung function may also support the absence of long-term adverse airway reactions occurring beyond 3 months post-treatment.\nThe current study has limitations, principally the small cohort  size,  and  a  lack  of  a  sham-control  group.  However, a strength of this study is its high retention through 3  years  of  follow-up,  which  is  rare  in  early-stage  device trials. Moreover, any placebo effect assumed by the openlabel design would not be expected to impact 2 or 3-year measures. The absence of decline three years post-treatment compared with baseline supports stability for lung function and quality of life in this study and both are consistent with the stable rate of exacerbations observed in this study [24]. These observations will need to be confirmed in an ongoing large scale sham-controlled randomized  trial  (AIRFLOW-3)  comparing  the  efficacy  of TLD plus  optimal  medical  care  for  patients  with  moderate-to-severe  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  against  optimal  medical  care  for Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [25].",
