      "content": "Lung cancer remains a challenging disease despite clear knowledge of its aetiology. In Europe, there were 400 000 people diagnosed with lung cancer, and approximately 350 000 expected deaths in 2010. 1 Five-year survival remains poor at 9.0%. On a global basis, the 2012 statistics suggested that lung cancer was responsible for 1.59 million deaths. 2 The problem is compounded as most lung cancers are diagnosed late in their natural history , and about 75% of patients have advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. 3 Hence, identi /uniFB01 cation of patients with lung cancer at the earliest stage is vital if outcomes\nfor lung cancer are to be improved. Results from the National Lung Screening Trial have been very encouraging and have suggested a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality in the screened group. 4 However, approximately 25% of the scans demonstrated a nodule, of which most (96.4%) were nonmalignant. Furthermore, 713 (4%) of participants required a surgical procedure to establish a diagnosis. This was associated with a signi /uniFB01 cant morbidity, as 165 subjects (23% of those undergoing surgery) had at least one complication and there were /uniFB01 ve deaths. Increased use of surgery for the management of screen-detected nodules shifts the value of screening due to the cost implications and risks of surgical procedures. 5 A recent meta-analysis of 39 clinical studies evaluating a variety of bronchoscopic techniques with over 3000 solitary pulmonary nodules (SPN) sampled demonstrated a wide diagnostic range from 18% to 75%. 6 Transthoracic procedures have a greater accuracy but with higher complication rates, especially pneumothoraces that occur in 15% of cases. 7\nSeveral bronchoscopic approaches exist; standard bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy under /uniFB02 uoroscopic guidance, 8 ultrathin bronchoscopy, 9 virtual bronchoscopy-guided biopsy, 10 radial endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy , 11 electromagnetic",

The system calculates two suitable point of entry (POE) locations with straight line, vessel-free access to the SPN, as well as bronchoscopy paths for guiding the user ' s bronchoscope to the POE locations. Additionally, the Archimedes System displays the tunnel path from the POE on the airway wall to the SPN. The user is allowed to /uniFB01 ne-tune the POE location using a ' Virtual Doppler ' tool, which enables the user to inspect for presence of vessels outside of the airway wall in the virtual bronchoscopy view. Users are also able to visualise the blood vessels during the virtual bronchoscopy review of the path to the selected POE, which is painted as a target on the airway wall. A cylindrical icon on the POE describes the orientation of the bronchoscope. The bronchial diameter, bronchoscopy path distance, tunnel length to the front of the target, target size, and distance from the back of the target to the nearest pleura location are all provided in the virtual bronchoscopy view. During the procedure, the Archimedes System integrates real-time /uniFB02 uoroscopy data with the 3D CT data to guide a sheath from the POE on the airway wall through the lung parenchyma directly to the SPN.",

Once the POE location was reached, the subsequent procedural steps were adapted from the airway bypass procedure that was performed for the treatment of severe emphysema. 17 A coring needle (FleXNeedle, Broncus Medical, Mountain View, California, USA) was inserted through the working channel of a standard therapeutic bronchoscope (1T180, Olympus Medical, Tokyo, Japan) and through the airway wall at the identi /uniFB01 ed POE in the airway ( /uniFB01 gure 1). Aspiration was performed during slow withdrawal of the needle to further con /uniFB01 rm that there was no vascular puncture during needle insertion. An atraumatic balloon dilator was used to enlarge the hole made at the POE, and a sheath with a blunt dissection stylet was inserted through the entry hole created in the airway. The sheath with radiopaque marker bands and a blunt dissection stylet was then used to create a tunnel within the lung parenchyma to the proximal aspect of the nodule under fused /uniFB02 uoroscopy guidance. The projection of the 3D target nodule from the CT model and tunnel ' guide rails ' were displayed on the fused /uniFB02 uoroscopy image. Once the sheath tip was advanced up to 10 mm through the POE, the orientation of the tip was adjusted towards the target and con /uniFB01 rmed with multiple /uniFB02 uoroscopy projections. Con /uniFB01 rmation of the tunnel direction was repeated every 10 mm -20 mm of advancement throughout the tunnelling process. Once the proximal aspect of the nodule was reached, with suf /uniFB01 cient clearance for opening the forceps, the stylet was removed and biopsy forceps was inserted through the sheath and biopsy samples were taken under fused /uniFB02 uoroscopy guidance. Where the nodules were not visible at /uniFB02 uoroscopy, the sheath and blunt dissection stylet were advanced to the edge of the target displayed on the fused /uniFB02 uoroscopy view. Furthermore, in these cases, during biopsy sampling, the patient was put on a breath-hold state each time a sample was taken to suppress the breathing motion. Additionally, since the tip of the sheath/tunnel is within close proximity of the lesion, the motion of the sheath/tunnel tip is in synchrony with the target itself.",

      "content": "Twelve patients were enrolled in this study (6 men and 6 women) with a median age of 62 years (range 40 -72). The BTPNA procedure was successfully completed in 10 patients (83%), and a positive biopsy was successfully obtained in all 10 cases in which a tunnel was successfully created from the POE to the SPN. The key procedural steps from a BTPNA procedure are shown in /uniFB01 gure 2. There were no signi /uniFB01 cant intraprocedural adverse events (table 1). Fluoroscopy, after completion of the procedure, did not reveal any occurrence of adverse events, such as pneumothorax. Inspection during surgical resection and of the resected lobe did not reveal any evidence of localised haemorrhage, bronchial or pulmonary lacerations. The only adverse event observed was a transient rise in troponin levels in one patient post-BTPNA and surgical resection. Outpatient follow-up conducted at 90 days and 180 days after the procedure did not reveal any adverse events attributable to the procedure.\nAdequate histological sampling suf /uniFB01 cient for a histological diagnosis was successfully achieved in 10 of the patients. Inspection at surgery and in the postresection specimens demonstrated that the tunnel path was created in the correct position and orientation that led directly to the target nodule. Figure 3 demonstrates the tract created in one of the patients. Furthermore, the histological /uniFB01 ndings from the biopsies obtained by BTPNA correlated with the /uniFB01 nal pathology in all the surgically resected nodules ( /uniFB01 gure 4). In the two patients where the BTPNA procedure could not be completed, the nodules were located in the apical section of the left upper lobe. In these patients, it was not possible to orientate the bronchoscope at the POE location to achieve a straight-line tunnel path to the target nodule due to limitations of the bronchoscope size and angulation, and proximity of the aorta and pulmonary artery. Furthermore, alternative access points were not practical due to the close proximity of major blood vessels. However, we were able to access nodules in the left upper lobe using the BTPNA approach in two other patients. In this initial study, there were no patients with a nodule in the right upper lobe, and the other nodules were distributed throughout the lung.\nIn seven of the 12 patients, the nodules were not visible at /uniFB02 uoroscopy. Despite this, using Archimedes fused /uniFB02 uoroscopy guidance, the procedure was successfully completed in six of these seven patients. In the one patient where the procedure was not completed, the main factor was the dif /uniFB01 culty in /uniFB01 nding a vessel-free path. Both histological con /uniFB01 rmation and postresection evaluation of the tract con /uniFB01 rmed accurate performance of the BTPNA procedure.\nThe mean procedure time was 39.8 min, with the planning stage accounting for 18.0 (range 10.0 -30.0) min, and the creation of the tunnelled pathway 21.8 (range 12.0 -40.0) min (table 1). The /uniFB02 uoroscopy time was 5.5 (range 1.8 -11.6) min. The mean tunnel length was 47 (range 10 -90) mm. The overall yield for BTPNA was 83% (10 out of 12) as the tract could not be created in two patients, as described above. The biopsy yield\nwas 100% for procedures where a tunnelled pathway was created, and at least one biopsy attempted. An average of 3.3 biopsy samples were obtained (range 0 -6) in the 12 patients who underwent BTPNA.",

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "content": "This report is a /uniFB01 rst in human study that evaluates the safety and feasibility of a novel approach for the access to and diagnosis of SPNs. Although the concept of creating access from the bronchial tree to the lung parenchyma has been explored in patients with severe emphysema, 17 this is the /uniFB01 rst human report of creating tunnelled paths from the bronchial segments through the lung parenchyma directly to the SPNs. The procedure was successfully performed in 10 out of 12 patients with no signi /uniFB01 cant adverse events observed at the time of the procedure or in the follow-up period. There was no evidence of signi /uniFB01 cant immediate bleeding or pneumothoraces, which were the primary safety concerns for this approach. Clinical follow-up at 6 months did not discover any unanticipated adverse events. It was challenging to evaluate the postprocedure safety in this study as the patients proceeded directly to surgical resection. However, this provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the tunnel paths created and inspect the resected lung for any lacerations or bleeding in the surrounding lung parenchyma. The current standard of transthoracic\nWhere size is the long axis diameter. *All areas involved in TPNA resected and no concerns identified. LLL, left lower lobe; LUL, left upper lobe; Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), non-small cell lung cancer; RLL, right lower lobe; RML, right middle lobe.\nCT-guided biopsy appears to have a pneumothorax risk of 15% and serious bleeding risk of 1%. 7\nThe creation of a tunnelled path and the use of a sheath enabled multiple biopsies to be performed with minimal additional risk. In this study, an average of 3.3 (range 0 -6) biopsies was performed, with at least four biopsies performed in eight participants, with no evidence of increased complications with greater biopsy number. By contrast, for transthoracic needle biopsies, the number of needle insertions is associated with a greater risk of pneumothoraces. 18 This increased pneumothorax risk is primarily related to the number of times the needle passes through the pleura, whereas with BTPNA, this risk is avoided. 19 Furthermore, with CT-guided biopsy, the depth of needle insertion, or the distance between the pleura and the nodule, is related to both an increased risk of a pneumothorax and also the need for chest tube placement. 20 In this early report with BTPNA, there was no increased risk of adverse events irrespective of the tunnel length created, despite the fact that lengths of 50 mm or greater were created in seven patients. In one patient, a 90 mm long tunnelled pathway was safely created and a biopsy successfully performed. The current limitation of BTPNA appears to be the apex of the lung where it is more dif /uniFB01 cult to control the angulation and orientation of the sheath and dissection tip in the required direction, particularly in the apex of the left upper lobe which is blocked from access by the aorta and pulmonary artery. The true extent of this limitation will become clearer with greater experience in this procedure.\nThe procedure may appear more complicated than a transthoracic CT-guided biopsy, but this early feasibility study appears to\nhave a lower risk of immediate adverse events. A learning curve was demonstrated with the /uniFB01 rst four, second four and third four tunnel creation times averaging 35.0, 21.5 and 13.3 min, respectively . Hence, after only eight procedures, the procedure time of BTPNA is comparable to either transthoracic CT-guided biopsy or standard transbronchial biopsy. BTPNA may have a complimentary role with transthoracic needle aspiration, as the former may be a more appropriate choice for nodules or tumours in certain anatomical locations, for example, centrally located nodules or behind the scapula, or where two pleural planes need to be traversed for a transthoracic approach. It may also be a safer approach in patients with emphysema due to the lower risk of pneumothorax. About a third of patients with potentially curable disease do not undergo surgical resection due to factors, such as disease, comorbidity and age. 21 In the future, our approach may facilitate local treatment of early lung cancers in this group of patients.\nIn conclusion, the BTPNA approach improves the accessibility of peripheral nodules via the bronchoscopic route. In this small pilot study, the technique appears to be safe and feasible. Further research is warranted with multicentre interventional studies and, ultimately, a randomised controlled study against the current standard of transthoracic lung biopsy.",
