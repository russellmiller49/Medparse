      "content": "Bronchoscopic  lung  volume  reduction  (BLVR)  with  lung  volume reduction coils or endobronchial valves (EBV) have become guideline treatments [1]. Both treatments are aimed to reduce hyperinflated lung volumes  in  Chronic  Obstructive  Pulmonary  Disease  (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)),  and  by doing that, these treatments have shown significant benefit for patients in terms of improved pulmonary function, lung volumes, exercise capacity and quality of life [2]. However, not a lot is known about the impact of BLVR treatments on patient survival.\nThere are a handful of publications on survival after EBV treatment. First, in 19 EBV treated patients followed up to 10 year after treatment, it was shown that patients in whom lobar atelectasis was achieved after EBV treatment had a survival benefit compared to patients who did not [3,4]. This finding was confirmed in a larger cohort of 449 treated patients in whom successful lobar atelectasis was found to be associated\nwith a survival benefit [5]. A fourth publication showed that the BODE index which is known as a predictor of survival improved after EBV treatment [6,7]. To our knowledge, there is only a single publication that has reported on long term survival after coil treatment, showing a 5 year follow-up in 45 patients, of whom 51% were still alive [8].\nThe above mentioned studies that investigated survival after BLVR generally have had small sample sizes, or only compared responders of the  treatment  with  non-responders  based  on  Residual  Volume  (RV) reduction  or  presence  of  lobar  atelectasis.  None  of  these  studies compared the potential beneficial effect on survival with patients who did not undergo a BLVR treatment. Furthermore, not much is reported on the general survival rate in this specific group of severe Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the survival rate in patients who are evaluated for BLVR treatment and to see whether there is a difference in survival rate between patients who undergo BLVR treatment and patients who do not.",

Quantitative CT analysis was performed using LungQ software (Thirona, Nijmegen, The Netherlands). The questionnaires included  the  St.  Georges  Respiratory  Questionnaire  (SGRQ),  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) assessment Test (CAT) [12,13] and a self-administered questionnaire about the presence of comorbidities.

The median  survival  time  of  patients  who  were  treated  with  BLVR  was significantly  longer compared to patients who were not treated with BLVR  (3133  days  (95%CI  2777 -3489)  versus  2503  days  (95%CI 2281 -2725), p < 0.001) (Fig. 1). There was no significant difference in median survival time between the patients who received coils or EBVs (3171  days  versus  3133  days,  respectively);  See  online  supplement Figs. S2 and S3).\nTo determine whether BLVR treatment was an independent predictor of survival in this group we first assessed which other factors influenced survival. The other factors that significantly negatively influenced survival were male gender, higher age, higher number of packyears, higher number of hospitalizations for a Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, lower FEV1, higher RV or RV/Total Lung Capacity(TLC)-ratio, lower DLCO, higher PaCO2,\nlower PaO2, lower BMI, lean weight or fat free mass index, higher percentage  of  emphysema,  air  trapping  score  or  airway  wall  thickness measured on CT-scan and one of the following 3 comorbid events in the medical history: myocardial infarction, a percutaneous coronary intervention or stroke (Table 2).\nIt was not possible to include all the survival-influencing factors in one  regression-model  because  not  all  patients  performed  all  tests; consequently only a low number of patients would be included in this kind of model. Nevertheless, we included as many different factors as possible with the highest number of cases included. When adjusting for gender, age, packyears, FEV1, RV/TLC, BMI, PaCO2, PaO2, emphysema destruction score, airway wall thickness and the presence of myocardial infarction, a percutaneous coronary intervention or stroke in medical history, not undergoing the BLVR treatment was an independent predictor  of  mortality  (Hazard  Ratio:  2.016  (95%CI:  1.455 -2.793,  p < 0.001) (Table 3).",

      "content": "Our results showed that the median survival time for patients who are  considered  for  BLVR  treatment  was  approximately  7.4  years. Furthermore, the median survival time was significantly longer for patients treated with BLVR compared to patients who were not. The difference between these groups was 630 days, which is approximately 1.7 years. Furthermore, undergoing BLVR treatment was an independent predictor of survival when adjusted for other survival-influencing factors like age, gender, or disease severity.\nPatients treated with BLVR had a median survival time of 3133 days (approximately 8.6 years) compared to 2503 days (approximately 6.9 years) for the non-treated group. The patient population included in this analysis  is  a  highly  selected  population  because  all  patients  were referred  to  our  institution  for  BLVR  and  invited  for  a  consultation. Therefore, it is difficult to make a direct comparison to other severe Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) populations. The most comparable population is the NETT trial population, which consisted of patients who were eligible for lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS). In this group, the median survival time was approximately 6 years for the LVRS-group and approximately 5 years  for  the  medical  care  control  group  (not  receiving  LVRS)  [14].\nJ.E. Hartman et al.\nGLYPH<0>GLYPH<20>GLYPH<0>GLYPH<28>GLYPH<0>GLYPH<25>\nGLYPH<0>\nFurthermore,  in  large  general  cohorts  of  patients  with  (very)  severe Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) the median survival time ranged between approximately 2.3 to 5.2 years for men, and between approximately 3.2 and > 8 years for women [15,16]. The median survival time in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients after lung transplantation was found to be 6.3 and 9 years [17,18].\nOur study differs from previously reported survival studies on BLVR in that we compared patients who underwent BLVR with patients who\ndid not. The only other paper that compared patient selected for BLVR and not selected for BLVR is also from our hospital, and included some of the same patients [9]. However, it was limited to patients evaluated till 2014 and incorporated data of patient who were referred to but did not visit our hospital. We included all treated patients, regardless of whether they were responders or non-responders to the treatment and therefore the difference in survival when excluding the non-treatment-responders in our population could have been even larger. Even when considering that  in  the  other  studies,  the  responders  based  on  the  presence  of  a complete lobar atelectasis, consisted only of 26 -45% of the total patients treated  in  those  studies  [3 -5,8].  A  pitfall  of  our  study  is  that  the non-treated group were not eligible for treatment (except for the small group that declined BLVR treatment themselves) which could have been reasons  impacting  survival.  On  the  other  hand,  the  group  that  was treated with BLVR had a significantly worse Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) functional disease status, as well as a higher degree of co-morbidity, which would probably negatively influence survival. Only the number of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations was higher in the non-BLVR group, which is known as a predictor of mortality. Furthermore, it would not have been ethical to withhold a known effective treatment from a group eligible for treatment for a long period to evaluate survival or other outcomes. The NETT trial, investigating LVRS, did include a control group for a long term follow up. After a median of 4.3 years they found that the mortality rate was significantly higher in the control group compared to the LVRS group, despite the increased early mortality secondary to the surgery [14]. These data from NETT also  indicate  that  lung  volume  reduction  positively  influences survival in these patients.\nOur results showed that BLVR treatment was an independent predictor of survival. The other independent predictors of survival were lower age, female gender, less hyperinflation or emphysema severity, higher BMI, higher PaO2 and less bronchial wall thickness measured on CT-scan. Of which most are known from literature [15,19 -22]. We did not find a difference in median survival time between the two different BLVR techniques: coils or EBV treatment.\nBesides the selected population and potential selection bias in our control group which included patients who were not eligible for BLVR, another limitation of our study is that the causes of death and also other medical  events  or  treatments  during  the  follow  up  period  were  unknown. This  additional  information  could  have  provided  a  more  indepth  analysis  of  mortality  in  this  specific  patient  group.  However, strengths of our study are the large sample size population for whom the vital status could be verified, and the targeted patient population with extended demographics and the long-term follow up.\nIn  conclusion,  our  results  together  with  the  existing  literature  on both  bronchoscopic  and  surgical  lung  volume  reduction  treatments show that reducing lung volume in patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and severe hyperinflation and reduced life expectancy may lead to a survival benefit.",
