    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ultrasound elastography noninvasively estimates tissue hardness. Studies have evaluated elastography for differentiating malignant from benign lymph nodes during endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration. Several methods of performing elastography are described with variable diagnostic accuracy. METHODS: The aim of this study was to evaluate endobronchial ultrasound-guided elastography in differentiating malignant from benign mediastinal lymphadenopathy. We performed a systematic search of the PubMed and Embase databases to extract the relevant studies. A diagnostic accuracy meta-analysis was carried out to calculate the pooled sensitivity and specificity [with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)], and positive and negative likelihood ratios of elastography. RESULTS: After a systematic search, 20 studies (1600 patients, 2712 nodes) were selected. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of elastography were 0.90 (95% CI, 0.84-0.94) and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.73-0.84), respectively. The summary receiver operating curve demonstrated an area under the curve for elastography of 0.90 (0.88-0.93). The positive and negative likelihood ratios and the diagnostic odds ratio were 4.3 (95% CI, 3.3-5.5), 0.12 (95% CI, 0.07-0.20), and 35 (95% CI, 19-63), respectively. Of the most commonly described methods, the color classification method (type 3 malignant vs. type 1 benign) demonstrated the highest area under the curve of 0.91 (0.88-0.93). There was significant heterogeneity and publication bias. Subgroup analyses indicated no significant difference between the sensitivity and specificity of quantitative and qualitative elastography methods. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound elastography is useful in differentiating malignant and benign lymph nodes during endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration. However, elastography does not replace the requirement of lymph node aspiration.",

Elastography has also been described as computer-assisted palpation. 9 After the development of technology to image elasticity in 1991, elastography was /uniFB01 rst used for the characterization of malignant breast lesions. 10,11 Subsequently, use was described in the pancreas and thyroid nodules. A harder tissue, like one in /uniFB01 ltrated by malignancy, is stiffer and less deformable. The hardness is analyzed as a color-based output that is interpreted in different methods based on the equipment. Before Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, elastography had been used in endoscopy-ultrasound (EUS)FNA for differentiation between benign and malignant abdominal lymphadenopathy. 12\nThe /uniFB01 rst feasibility study of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography was reported in 2013. 9 Since then, various methods of elastography assessment have been described. These broadly include 2 categories: qualitative and quantitative methods. The most commonly described method of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography categorized the elastography images into 3 patterns. This method divides elastography images into 3 color patterns, as de /uniFB01 ned by Izumo et al 5 : (type 1) predominant nonblue, (type 2) part blue part nonblue, and (type 3) predominantly blue. Hard tissue like malignancy displays mostly blue color, whereas softer tissues like benign lesions display mainly nonblue (redgreen) color. Other qualitative methods include a 4-color or 5-color classi /uniFB01 cation on similar principles. The later-described quantitative methods include the strain ratio (SR), blue color proportion (BCP), stiff area ratio (SAR), and strain histogram methods. 8,13 -15\nA meta-analysis reported the /uniFB01 ndings from 7 published studies on Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography. 16 Many other recent studies have reported variable sensitivity and speci /uniFB01 city of elastography. The studies have methodological variability and have used different measures for reporting diagnostic accuracy. Therefore, we performed a systematic review to summarize the studies describing the utility of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography. We also carried out a metaanalysis to calculate the pooled sensitivity and speci /uniFB01 city of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography. We also carried out summary receiver operating curve (SROC)\nanalysis and meta-regression to study the effect of various characteristics affecting the sensitivity and speci /uniFB01 city.",

The methodological quality of the studies using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool is summarized in Table 2.\nTwelve studies (60%) were prospective and 8 (40%) were retrospective. 18 (90%) were single center [except Korrungruang and Boonsarngsuk 23 (2 centers) and Verhoeven et al 32 (5 centers)]. In 11 studies (55%), mild to deep sedation was used, 4 (20%) used general anesthesia (GA), and in one, use of both sedation and GA (5%) was described for performing Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA. The majority of studies used the Olympus Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscope (13, 65%). A scanning frequency of 7.5 MHz was most commonly used. The rest of the equipment and procedure-related data are summarized in Table 1. The most frequently sampled lymph node stations were subcarinal (station 7) and lower right paratracheal (Station 4R). Rapid on-site evaluation was\navailable in 12 (60%) studies and a 22 G needle (100%) was used in all studies, where needle-use data were reported.\nEight studies reported the use of both qualitative and quantitative parameters for analysis of elastography images. Six studies each reported the use of only a single quantitative or qualitative parameter alone for elastography assessment (Table 3). For primary reporting and the metaanalysis, the most accurate parameter reported by the authors was used for summary statistics (10 qualitative and 10 quantitative). Among the qualitative methods, the 3-color classi /uniFB01 cation system (type 1, 2, 3) was used most commonly. Other qualitative methods included either a 4-color or 5-color code pattern. The most used parameter for quantitative assessment was SR. Percentage of hard areas or BCP, SAR or blue pixel ratio, and strain histogram were the other quantitative methods described.

      "content": "In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we found that Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography is a useful modality for differentiating between benign and\nmalignant mediastinal lymph nodes during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA. The pooled diagnostic sensitivity and speci /uniFB01 city of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography were 0.90 (95% CI, 0.84-0.94) and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.73-0.84), respectively. Signi /uniFB01 cant heterogeneity in sensitivity ( I 2 = 86.08, Q = 136.48, P < 0.01) and speci /uniFB01 city ( I 2 = 91.75, Q = 230.43, P < 0.01) was observed. Subgroup analyses strongly suggested that the number of patients strongly in /uniFB02 uenced the sensitivity, while the number of lymph nodes studied, GA, and retrospective study design in /uniFB02 uenced the heterogeneity in speci /uniFB01 city. There was no difference between the sensitivity and speci /uniFB01 city of qualitative versus quantitative methods of elastography assessment.\nThe elastographic classi /uniFB01 cation of lymph nodes into 3 color types, type 1 (predominantly nonblue pattern), type 2 (part blue and part nonblue pattern), and type 3 (predominantly blue pattern), is the most frequently described method on Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography\n(8 of the 20 published studies). 5 This method is qualitative and operator dependent. The blue pattern signi /uniFB01 ed a hard node with a higher probability of malignancy. In this meta-analysis, the Izumo method (type 3 vs. type 1 for malignancy) demonstrated the highest AUC among all techniques. In the initial study, there was also a good correlation between FDG-PET SUVmax and the color classi /uniFB01 cations. 5 However, a signi /uniFB01 cant drawback of this method is that the type 2 pattern is not included in diagnostic comparison (only type 3 was compared with type 1 for malignancy). 5,7,22,25,28,31 This choice leaves a large proportion of lymph nodes (part blue part nonblue) as unclassi /uniFB01 ed and does not add to clinical decisions. A large percentage of nodes in real-life settings will not /uniFB01 t into either a type 3 or type 1 pattern. Despite the high AUC, potential limitations of the method have been highlighted. Fournier et al 25 found a 23% prevalence of malignancy in type 1 nodes. Two of the 8 studies analyzed the data, including the type 2\npattern, in which type 3 was considered malignant, while type 1/type 2 was deemed to be benign for calculations. 27,33 However, this comparison was associated with reduced sensitivity. Two studies used a 5-color group classi /uniFB01 cation. 24,29 Increasing the color groups increases subjectivity and decreases reproducibility. Another major limitation of color classi/uniFB01 cation is the probability of /uniFB01 brotic lymph nodes (like post TB nodes) to appear as blue. 24 This overlap may signi /uniFB01 cantly affect elastography interpretation in populations with a high prevalence of granulomatous conditions such as TB, sarcoidosis, and anthracosis. 22,35,36\nThe SR is the most reported (4 studies) quantitative elastography method. 13,21,23,30 However, this method has considerable heterogeneity in the cutoffs used and is one of the most variable parameters. 31 Also, there is ambiguity in the perinodal area to be selected for its calculation. Cutoff values ranging from 2.47 to 32.07 are described, yielding variable sensitivity, speci /uniFB01 city, and diagnostic accuracy. In our meta-analysis, this method had the least AUC among the most commonly used methods. The method of selection of areas for SR is not standardized; therefore, this is subject to heavy operator bias. Although operators have attempted to minimize the error by taking a mean of multiple readings for the SR, this still does not take care of the area of selection. The second most frequently described method (3 studies) is the SAR [stiff areas as blue pixels (145 to 180 pixel area)/ lymph node area as ROI pixels]. 8,26,34 However, this requires another image analysis software (Image J) to calculate the stiff (blue) areas. It requires obtaining JPEG images or video clips for the software. Addition of another software for image analysis increases the procedure complexity, increasing the reporting times, and this impacts the real-life clinical utility of this method. 8 One study used a BCP based on a similar principle, but the software (Photoshop CS5) for the purpose was different. A multicenter study and a previous publication by 1 group explored the strain histogram method (2 studies) based on the mean strain. 15,32 However, the cutoffs of the mean strain in the 2 studies were different. A combination of mean strain, node size, and PET-CT /uniFB01 ndings improved accuracy. In this method, examined lymph node showed elastography color dispersion in the ROI and provided the mean tissue elasticity. The blue color corresponded to a value of 0 and red color corresponded to a value of 255. Lymph nodes with more strain were suggestive of benignity and showed histograms with higher mean strain values.\nHowever, this method showed low diagnostic accuracy as compared with the other methods. The frequency histograms and blue proportion are less variable ( < 10%) than the SR (30.8%). 31 Qualitative versus quantitative method did not in /uniFB02 uence the heterogeneity in sensitivity in our meta-analysis. Both methods have been found to be comparable in some studies where both techniques were used. 23\nAll the described methods of elastography have signi /uniFB01 cant limitations. As has been reported by various authors, the high negative and positive predictive values of elastography do not underscore the need to obtain tissue for a de /uniFB01 nitive diagnosis. The technology may aid in choosing a node for sampling if multiple nodes are involved, for selecting a speci /uniFB01 c area for sampling, and to reduce the number of passes. 21 Despite these limitations, data indicate that elastographic features are more sensitive than B mode ultrasound features alone. Ideally, a combination of elastography with B mode features gives a superior diagnostic accuracy. 7,21,26 Lin et al 28 also observed that B mode features such as central necrosis in /uniFB02 uence the accuracy of elastography for malignancy. Increased speci /uniFB01 city and PPV for malignancy have also been reported when elastography is combined with PET-CT. 30\nOverall, the analysis found an NLR of 0.12, which indicates that the test could reasonably exclude malignancy when it is negative. However,\nthe PLR is 4.3 (usually an LR+ > 10 is associated with a large and signi /uniFB01 cant increase in disease probability with a positive test result), thereby indicating the possibility of FP results. Hence, the pooled estimates are not strong enough to replace the actual sampling of the lymph nodes. Even with relatively high speci /uniFB01 city and sensitivity, the PLR is low, making this test prone to FP results. In the common scenario where Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA is being performed to diagnose or stage a lung cancer, the information that this test provides will not change the bronchoscopists ' choice of which lymph nodes to biopsy. There are certain limitations in this meta-analysis. Only 1 parameter was included per study for pooled analysis. Second, the pooled data have signi /uniFB01 cant heterogeneity in terms of the diagnostic cutoffs and the gold standard. The elastography procedure itself has inherent limitations such as the amount of pressure used while generating the images, the selection of the perinodal area for estimation of SR, and multiple components of subjective interpretation. We did not publish the metaanalysis protocol in advance. In systematic reviews and meta-analysis, it may be useful to compare the outcomes reported in the manuscript against those in the protocol to check for outcome reporting bias. However, we did not observe deviations from the preplanned analyses.",

      "content": "algorithms and software of different manufacturers vary, thereby limiting the generalizability of the results. A standard algorithm across manufacturers may be ideal.\nAs there was a possible effect of the method of sedation on speci /uniFB01 city, a standardized protocol should be used for the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA procedure. Elastography /uniFB01 ndings are likely to be affected by a coughing or a lightly sedated patient as compared with an immobile comfortable /uniFB01 eld. The results should be available in real time to the operator without the delay of image processing using additional software. Most of the studies on elastography are single-center studies with a speci /uniFB01 c patient pro /uniFB01 le. Many have included only lung cancer and excluded the other conditions. Prospective multicenter studies, including a variety of disease conditions, with large sample sizes are required for validation. None of the studies has evaluated the elastography characteristics during EUS-B-FNA, and future research should also include this. The protocol for selecting an ROI should preferably be automated as this is a signi /uniFB01 cant cause for heterogeneity in calculations. Also, apart from lung cancer, other malignant causes of lymphadenopathy should be validated. The consistency of performance at all lymph node stations needs to be con /uniFB01 rmed. Some authors have described dif /uniFB01 culty at the 4R station, especially in patients with mediastinal fat. The protocol should work on dynamic images rather than a static protocol so that it is not an individual static image, but a composite of pictures that are interpreted. One of the arguments made in favor of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography is the potential to save time by selecting out the likely benign lymph nodes and limiting the number of stations that need to be biopsied. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA is not necessarily a time-consuming procedure and even a full mediastinal survey can be conducted in a reasonable amount of time. 37\nFinally, the validation against a surgical gold standard will be ideal in nondiagnostic EBUSTBNA. Many studies included the results of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA as the gold standard, which is not appropriate for validation of new technology. Prediction models may need to be created incorporating the clinical and imaging data to improve the diagnostic accuracy.\nThe data presented in the meta-analysis highlight the need for more standardization in terms of technology to improve test discrimination and limit operator dependence. The results do not support any change in standard clinical practice. In the current\nform, standalone elastography may not be suf /uniFB01 cient to exclude malignancy or con /uniFB01 rm benignity.",
