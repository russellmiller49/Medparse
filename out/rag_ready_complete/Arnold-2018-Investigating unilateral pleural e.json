Despite widespread use, there is uncertainty about its sensitivity to diagnose malignant pleural effusions (MPEs). Our aim was to ascertain the utility of cytology using a large prospective cohort.\nConsecutive patients presenting with an undiagnosed unilateral pleural effusion were recruited to this UK-based study. All had pleural fluid sent for cytological analysis. Cytological sensitivity was based on the final diagnosis at 12 months, confirmed by two consultants.\nOver 8 years, 921 patients were recruited, of which 515 had a MPE. Overall sensitivity of fluid cytology to diagnose malignancy was 46% (95% CI 42 -58%). There was variation in sensitivity depending on cancer primary, with mesothelioma (6%) and haematological malignancies (40%) being significantly lower than adenocarcinomas (79%). MPEs secondary to ovarian cancer had high pick-up rates (95%). In asbestos-exposed males with exudative effusions, the risk of MPE was 60%, but cytological sensitivity was 11%.\nThis is the largest prospective study of pleural fluid cytology and informs discussions with patients about the likely requirement for investigations following thoracentesis. In patients presenting with a clinical suspicion of mesothelioma, cytological sensitivity is low, so more definitive investigations could be performed sooner.\nReceived: April 22 2018 | Accepted after revision: Sept 10 2018",

      "title": "Introduction",
      "content": "Pleural fluid analysis with cytological assessment is a fundamental part of the investigation of unilateral pleural effusions. In Europe and North America, one of the commonest causes is primary or secondary pleural malignancy [1]. Identifying malignancy from pleural fluid cytology alone can spare patients from more invasive investigations, reduces healthcare costs, is important for staging and allows earlier progression to treatment. However, it has several drawbacks, including an uncertain sensitivity and extends the time (routinely between 5 and 7 days) before further investigations are organised [2].\nThe estimates of sensitivity for detecting malignancy from pleural fluid cytology vary greatly within guidelines, ranging from 40% to 87% [1, 3]. The reason for this variation is due to retrospective study designs [4 -7], selective study inclusion criteria [8, 9] and a variation in cytopathological methods. Additionally, most studies of cytological yield cited in guidelines are >20 years old. There has been a significant advance in immunohistochemical methods since then.\nBetter knowledge of the discriminative ability of pleural fluid cytology would allow not only more informed consultations with patients, but better planning of further investigations. This study uses a large prospective cohort of patients with undiagnosed unilateral pleural effusions to assess cytological sensitivity depending on cancer type and patient factors. It aims to inform practice for respiratory physicians when diagnosing malignant pleural effusions.",

      "content": "As per guidelines, 40 mL of pleural fluid was sent for cytological analysis where possible [1]. It is standard practice in our centre that after preparing slides from the centrifuged deposit, a formalin-fixed paraffin embedded cell block is produced from each pleural fluid cytology sample. All samples were reviewed by a consultant cytopathologist. Depending on the degree of clinical suspicion of malignancy and/or initial cytological assessment, immunostaining was requested. The panel of immunohistochemical stains often included epithelial membrane antigen to distinguish between malignant cells and reactive mesothelial cells. Markers to distinguish between adenocarcinoma cells (AUA1 or, in later years, BerEP4) and mesothelial cells (CK5/6 and calretinin) were frequently used. In cases of adenocarcinoma, further immunostaining was undertaken to assess the most likely primary site. These markers included CK7, CK20, TTF1, oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and Ca125. Overlap of staining patterns sometimes occurred, with variation in the exact panels used between patients, but generally this panel of immunohistochemical stains provided useful information for diagnosis. Flow cytometry for lymphoma was sent based on a previously published algorithm [12]. A full breakdown of positive immunohistochemical markers in malignant effusions is shown in online supplementary appendix 1. Samples that were ' nondiagnostic ' for malignancy were those where a diagnosis of malignancy was not made based on the cytological specimen, with the patient requiring further investigations or interval radiological follow-up. In this instance, and\nwhen malignancy was the most likely diagnosis, it was usual practice to proceed to definitive biopsy ( e.g. thoracoscopy or computed tomography (CT)-guided biopsy), instead of repeating thoracentesis.",

      "title": "Discussion",
      "content": "This is the largest ever prospective study examining the role of pleural fluid cytology in undiagnosed unilateral pleural effusions. With >900 patients, we can give an accurate assessment of the strengths and limitations of cytological assessment. The size of this cohort has allowed for analysis by cancer subtype and the construction of a diagnostic flowchart to demonstrate the likelihood of malignancy with the corresponding cytological sensitivity.\nAn unexplained pleural effusion is a common diagnostic challenge for the respiratory physician. In Europe and North America, a common cause is primary or secondary malignancy. Therefore, pleural fluid cytology is an essential aspect of pleural fluid analysis, but one that is poorly understood. It is recognised\nthat sensitivity is low, but estimates vary widely within international guidelines (40 -87%) [1, 3]. This variation arises because estimates are based on retrospective analyses of hospital or outpatient data [4 -7]. PORCEL et al. [13] published a series of 3077 undiagnosed pleural effusions, of which 840 had a malignant aetiology. Overall, preliminary pleural fluid cytology was positive in 51% of malignant effusions, but due to geographical variation the prevalence of mesothelioma within the cohort was <1%, compared to 16% in our cohort. They also demonstrated that cytology was more accurate in adenocarcinoma of the lung (78%), breast (68%) and ovary (70%). The data were collected retrospectively from 1994 to 2013, which could explain why estimates for sensitivity were lower than in the current study, given the advancement in immunohistochemical analysis. Retrospective series of lab cytology samples have been published, with very large numbers of subjects (n>5000) [14 -17]. These report the number of samples where malignant cells\nData are presented as n, mean±SD or median (interquartile range), unless otherwise stated. Bold type represents statistical significance. N: neutrophil; L: lymphocyte; LDH: lactate dehydrogenase.\nwere seen, which, although epidemiologically useful, is not linked to clinical information or final diagnosis so does not reflect a measure of sensitivity.\nTwo studies have prospectively recruited and followed-up patients to assess the accuracy of pleural fluid cytology. In 1979, HIRSCH et al. [18] recruited 300 patients who required diagnostic thoracentesis. All patients were routinely followed-up, but given the lack of modern diagnostics ( i.e. CT scans) the final diagnosis was not identified in 20% of cases (compared to 0.6% in the current study). Malignancy was identified as a cause of the pleural effusion in 117 (39%) patients. The sensitivity of pleural fluid cytology alone to identify malignancy was 54% (95% CI 44.4 -63.1%). Given the small numbers there was no subgroup analysis by cancer type or patient characteristics. A more recent study, from Thailand, prospectively recruited 353 patients who underwent a diagnostic thoracentesis [19]. There was a high prevalence of malignancy within the cohort (78%) with one case of mesothelioma. Pleural fluid cytology was diagnostic in 61% (95% CI 55.5 -66.9%) of cases, with a higher sensitivity in lung cancer (73.7%) compared to nonlung solid cancers (53.5%) and haematological malignancy (35.5%). There was no further breakdown by cancer type or patient/fluid characteristics. However, the diagnostic criteria for malignancy were not robust with only 6% of cytology-negative malignant effusions having a definitive biopsy (compared to 90% in our cohort), with the remaining 94% being defined as cancerous following a ' response to chemotherapy ' . This may account for the high prevalence of malignant effusions within this cohort and will significantly affect the estimate of sensitivity. Additionally, only 15 mL of pleural fluid was sent for cytological analysis, which is considerably less than recommended by guidelines [1, 20]. In the current study, 40 mL of fluid was sent when possible. There was no significant difference in cytological sensitivity if less fluid was received, although numbers were small (44 samples <40 mL).\nWe have demonstrated that the overall sensitivity of pleural fluid cytology is slightly lower than the above prospective studies, at 45%. The most likely reason for this is the high proportion of mesothelioma diagnoses in our cohort (29%). This has a significant impact given the significant variability in sensitivity depending on cancer type. Mesothelioma was particularly low, with only 6% of cases being diagnosed on cytology alone. If the prevalence of mesothelioma is artificially lowered to be more in keeping with a typical European centre ( ∼ 10% of all malignant effusions) the overall sensitivity of pleural fluid cytology rises to 55%.\nSome centres from areas with very high mesothelioma incidence report higher predictive values from pleural fluid cytology, but these are not commonplace [21, 22]. In most UK and European centres patients will require definitive biopsy unless there is clear evidence of malignant mesothelial cells with corroborative immunohistochemical markers, especially given the medicolegal implications of the diagnosis.\nCytological sensitivity from other cancers varied considerably by primary site and cell type. Adenocarcinomas from the breast, lung, ovary or gastrointestinal tract could be reliably detected on pleural fluid cytology alone (with a combined sensitivity of 80%). Sensitivity approached 95% in ovarian cancer, which was significantly higher than other adenocarcinomas (p=0.013). The pleura is the most common site for extra-abdominal spread in ovarian cancer [23]. It is hypothesised that most malignant effusions from ovarian cancer result from direct pleural invasion of the diaphragm, or the migration of malignant ascitic fluid through diaphragmatic defects [24]. This mode of spread may result in more malignant cells being present in fluid, as opposed to the other malignancies which cause effusions due to disrupting normal pleural fluid recycling at the parietal membrane [25].\nWe have investigated the variation in cytological sensitivity within adenocarcinomas alone and found that cytology diagnostic effusions correlate with biochemical markers indicative of more advanced/ inflammatory malignancy (higher serum neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and C-reactive protein and pleural fluid LDH). Several previous smaller studies have correlated an increased cytological yield for other proxies of advanced tumours including lower pleural pH and glucose, macroscopic spread and survival [26 -29]. It follows that more advanced tumours are likely to be cytology-positive due to increased exfoliation of tumour cells into the effusion. However, we did not find the same relationship between survival and cytology positivity when assessing individual tumour types. This finding from previous studies is likely to be because adenocarcinomas with higher cytological sensitivity have slightly better overall survival, e.g. breast and ovarian cancers [30].\nThis variation in the utility of pleural fluid cytology has significant implications for planning further investigations. Guidelines recommend waiting for the pleural fluid cytology result before proceeding to other invasive and costly investigations ( e.g. local-anaesthetic thoracoscopy or CT-guided biopsy) [1]. This can take between 5 and 7 days (or longer if additional immunohistochemistry is required), and the patient may still be symptomatic without definitive pleural drainage. This study has shown that in asbestos-exposed male patients with no history of cancer, the likelihood of a diagnosing malignancy from an exudative effusion is just 6%, despite the risk of malignancy being >60%. For this patient demographic\nwe would support the approach of not waiting for the cytology result before performing a definitive biopsy. This is further supported by the finding that nearly 90% (117 out of 132) of the patients with a malignant effusion in this group had evidence of malignancy on their CT scan. In contrast, for patients not fulfilling these criteria, the higher sensitivity of pleural fluid cytology (>40%) justifies waiting for the result.\nThis study has weaknesses that may limit the generalisability of its findings. However, although this was a single-centre study, the cytological and immunohistochemical techniques employed are in use in most European centres. Secondly, the cytopathologists were not blinded to the clinical information; they had information from the requesting clinician as well as from the multidisciplinary meeting. This may have influenced their interpretation of the cytology specimen, but this study is a pragmatic assessment of the value of pleural fluid cytology in day-to-day practice. Additionally, a concern when using pleural fluid cytology alone to diagnose malignancy is that there is insufficient material for further analysis. This is increasingly relevant given the continued development of targeted immunotherapy for malignancies that metastasise to the pleura. In our study, given the change in immunohistochemistry and cytogenetic practice over the 8-year recruitment period, the suitability of pleural fluid specimens for further analysis is difficult to quantify. In the 41 incidences where receptor status or genetic analysis was requested, the pleural fluid specimen was sufficient in 95% (39 out of 41) of cases. Other studies with a focus on this issue have found that pleural fluid samples can reliably provide genetic information that correlates with the primary malignancy [31 -34].\nIn conclusion, this is the largest prospective study of pleural fluid cytology in the literature. We have shown considerable variation in the sensitivity of cytological assessment by primary cancer type with adenocarcinoma, especially ovarian, having especially high sensitivity. Haematological malignancy and mesothelioma were unlikely to be diagnosed with pleural cytology alone. This information can help to inform discussions with patients around the likelihood of needing further investigations for pleural effusions. In asbestos-exposed male patients with an exudative effusion and no history of cancer, a strategy of not waiting for the cytology result before organising further tests is justifiable and would speed up the diagnostic and treatment pathway.\nAcknowledgements: The authors would like to thank the patients, researchers and physicians who contributed to the pleural investigation study, on which this research was based.\nConflict of interest: None declared.",
