      "title": "1. Introduction",
      "content": "Airway stents can improve the pulmonary function of patients suffering from central airway obstruction and have the potential to save or prolong patients' lives. Airway stents are designed to restore airway patency and to mimic normal airway anatomy and physiology [1].\nIn general, airway stents can be classified into four types: silicone, balloon-expandable metal, uncovered self-expanding metal and covered self-expanding metal. When selecting a stent for a given patient, the clinician must take into account several considerations: whether the stent is permanent or temporary, whether the procedure requires general or local anesthetic, the stent's likelihood of migration, and whether it encourages tissue growth [1].\nEach type of stent is associated with advantages as well as disadvantages [2], and, thus far, no data have indicated clear superiority of one type over another [3]. Silicone stents can be easily removed and replaced as needed [4,5]. However, they have several major drawbacks, including a high migration rate, a low lumen-to-wall thickness ratio, difficulty in clearing secretions, and the need to carry out rigid bronchoscopy for their apposition [5-8]. Metallic stents, usually made of steel or nitinol, can be placed via flexible bronchoscopy,\nunder local anesthesia [6]. Balloon-expandable metallic stents are dilated by a balloon to the correct diameter at the target site. These stents lack the capacity for elastic re-expansion and therefore risk being crushed or becoming deformed with coughing; thus, they are not recommended for use in the central airways. However, they are often used in children, since they are available in sizes suitable for pediatric application [9]. Self-expanding metal stents have a shape memory that enables them to be restored to a predetermined configuration when released from a constraining delivery catheter [6]. These stents can be made of steel or nitinol and can either be uncovered or covered with thin polyurethane membranes. They are associated with lower likelihood of migration and less interface with cilia, and their walls are thinner, so their inner diameter is wider. However, they are difficult to remove due to the growth of airway epithelium around them, they can impair mucociliary clearance, are associated with recurrent lumen obstruction, with greater bacterial colonization and are also susceptible to metal fatigue and fracture over time [6,10,11]. Covered self-expanding metal stents are associated with a lower risk of tumor in-growth and granulation tissue formation. A disadvantage of this type of stent is that radial forces acting on the stent may cause necrosis of mucosa and fistula formation. These stents even collapse if the external force is too high, and granulation tissue at the uncovered ends may block the bronchus [10,3].\nIn order to be suitable for long-term use, stents must be able to respond to cough pressures by undergoing reversible reduction of the cross-sectional area [12]. A numerical study on the human healthy\ntrachea has shown that the trachea wall is subjected to maximal stress levels of 3.3 kPa in tension (inspiration) and 5.25 kPa in compression (expiration). During coughing these maximal and minimal values increase to 6 kPa and 7.25 kPa, respectively [12]. In the same study, stent-trachea models, silicone (Dumon) and metallic (Ultraflex), revealed that the presence of a stent prevents tracheal muscle deflections, especially during coughing. In addition, compared with the metallic stent-model, the silicone stent-model was shown to contain larger regions that are predisposed to sliding, leading to the conclusion that stent type selection plays an important role in improving clinical outcomes. Several numerical studies examined changes in airway flow and pressure during airway obstruction [13,14] and after stent placement [15]. Other studies employed finite element analysis to evaluate flow pattern, wall stress and deformation in healthy and stenosis trachea [16], to evaluate the influence of silicon stent-model on the trachea wall during inspiration and expiration [17] and to examine the influence of the same silicone stent-model on the trachea movement during swallowing [18].\nHowever, while airway stents can be life-saving and life prolonging, numerical and mechanical evaluation of mutual stress relationships between different airway stents and the trachea, has gained little attention. Of this relationship, the effect of the radial forces exerted by the different stents on the airways is of particular importance since radial forces are known to cause tissue growth around and inside the stent, a main drawback of airway stents [3,10].\nThe main objective of this study, therefore, was to evaluate, based on numerical simulation, the radial forces exerted on the trachea by different airway stents. This comparison might assist in selecting, for a given procedure, the most suitable commercially available airway stent. In addition, the mechanical functions of the four main types of airway stents were compared through mechanical measurements of radial stresses and strains.",

An adaptor was fitted to each stent such that its dimensions corresponded to the stent's circumference (Table 1). A stress-strain curve was obtained for each stent under evaluation, under a range of radially applied forces. Specifically, each of the tested stents was placed with its adaptor in the force gauge, and a gradually increasing radial force was applied to the stent until the adaptor tore. The measured parameters were vertical forces and vertical displacements. The radial stress σ was calculated based on the force data as follows:\nwhere Fy is the applied vertical force, and r and l are, respectively, the external radius and the length of the stent. The strain ε wascalculated as follows:\nwhere /Delta1 ly is the vertical displacement. Since, the adaptor was stiffer than the stent, its stretching was neglected. Once the stress-strain curves were plotted, their linear regions were extracted and compared. The measured mechanical properties of the smooth silicone stent were also compared to the properties obtained by the numerical simulations described in Section 2.2 below.",

      "title": "4. Discussion",
      "content": "Stent placement can rapidly relieve the acute stress cause by airway obstruction. When considering stent placement, it is important to select a correctly-sized stent. An undersized stent is subject to excessive friction with the wall of the airway, which may cause excessive tissue hyperplasia. In a clinical study, an oversized stent\nwas found to cause excessive radial pressure against the trachea mucosa and weakens microcirculation [20]. The airway stents simulated in the present study were oversized by 10-12% in the healthy trachea and by 15-17% in the stenotic tracheas. For each type of airway stent tested herein, the radial stress increased significantly with diameter. Although, stress level at 10% oversizing was the lowest observed in all stent types, the stress level is sufficient to ensure their apposition. Theseresults are comparable with blood vessel stent studies, in which there is a tendency to select stents that are oversized by 10% in order to ensure apposition without creating substantial wall stress [21].\nSignificantly higher stress levels were observed in stents composed of stiffer materials (higher Young's modulus), such as cobalt alloy and stainless steel 316 L, than in stents composed of nitinol or silicone (Fig. 7). Previous studies, which investigated the influence of dumon silicon stent on the trachea wall during inspiration and expiration and during swallowing, found similar maximal stresses at peak flow [17,18]. Studies on blood vessel stents obtained similar results, showing that less-stiff stents exert less stress on artery walls [22]. Additionally, the relatively low stress levels observed in silicone airway stents may indicate weak contact with the trachea and can explain these stents' known propensity for migration along the airway paths. This proposition is supported by studies on arterial stents, which claimed that compliant stents may not provide adequate support and might be more susceptible to migration [23].\nIn this study, the material properties of both cartilage and smooth muscles were assumed to be linear and isotropic. These assumptions turned to be justified in view of similar maximal stresses during peak flow obtained in previous studies [17,18] assuming anisotropic properties for the smooth muscle. It is suggested that the reason of the\nnegligibility of the anisotropy is the small deformations of the trachea that are induced during steady-state.\nA priori , one might expect that stents composed of materials with similar Young's modulus values should exhibit similar stress levels. However, the results of the present study indicate that the stresses exerted by a stent, are greatly influenced by the stent's structure. A continuous geometric structure, type D (wallstent), was associated with lower stress levels compared with type C stents (zigzag; Fig. 7a and b) and types G and H stents (both square and triangle) even though all these stents were composed of the same stent material. An opposite phenomenon was observed in the case of covered metal stents: the stresses exerted on healthy trachea were significantly lower for the internally-covered metal stent (triangle, A) than for the externally-covered metal stent (wallstent, B). This unexpected outcome probably resulted from the positioning of the cover, which affects the stiffness of the stent. The externally-covered metal stent has a smoother surface and thus fewer areas of concentrated stress, however, it is denser and therefore stiffer, which increases the stress on the trachea. Nevertheless, this type of stent is still more recommended for use, since its contact with the trachea is uniform, and contact stresses are evenly distributed. The even distributions of the contacts and the stresses eliminate localized stresses, which may promote tissue growth around the stent [24].\nStenosis of the trachea increases pressure on the inserted stent and thus increases the stresses that act both on the stent and on\nthe trachea. The fact that the stress levels under symmetric stenosis did not differ significantly from those under non-symmetric stenosis (Fig. 4) may be due to the relatively low percentage of stenosis modeled in the present study. A higher percentage of stenosis would most likely increase the differences in stress levels between the symmetric and asymmetric cases [25].\nTheelastic modulus (the slope of the curve in Fig. 4a and b) and the yield stresses of the metal stents calculated from the mechanical measurements (uncovered self-expandable metal stent, C: σ y = 5 . 3 kPa , E = 15.6 kPa) did not match the values associated with the material itself (nitinol: σ y = 280 MPa, E = 83 GPa). However, since the stents under evaluation either contain voids or are covered by silicone, their mechanical properties are affected not only by the stent material, but also by the voids and, in the covered stents, by the covering material. The combined effect makes the stents less stiff and with lower Young's moduli compared with the metal itself. Similarly, the results of the experiment clearly showed that elastic moduli were higher in covered metal stents than in uncovered metal stents; this finding can also be explained by the difference between the contribution of the voids to the stiffness when the voids are left empty and when they are filled by the covering material (silicone or PTFE). Accordingly, the covered stents are stiffer and have higher Young's modulus values. The silicone stent was distorted due to the radial forces; thus, a sharp reduction in stress was measured at the end of the stent's linear range (Fig. 4b and c).",

      "content": "While the present study presented extensive simulations and the integration of their results with those of mechanical measurements, some issues remain to be addressed. Firstly, the trachea was modeled as a simple elongated cylinder, and the material properties of both cartilage and smooth muscles were assumed to be linear and isotropic. Although this assumption was justified, further research directed to anisotropic property should not be excluded. The present study focused on the stent-trachea contact during steady-state phase thus, although the process of stent-opening influences the developed stresses on the trachea, the procedure was not simulated.\nThe present study did not examine the developed stresses on the trachea due to different breathing patterns such as, varied flow rates, coughing, etc. Future studies should integrate simulations of radial forces with the effect of airflow on the stress distribution.\nIn many cases, airway stents are inserted under conditions of malignant neoplasm, benign airway disease such as fibrotic scar or bottleneck stricture, or tracheobronchomalacia [6]. Here we study the effect of only 30% symmetric and non-symmetric stenosis. Future study should design a patient-specific trachea model.\nManagement of obstruction in children is challenging because of the specific characteristics of the lesions and the airways small dimensions [26]. Thus, it would be of interest to expand the numerical simulations presented in the present study so as to investigate the characteristics of different airway stents in small airways.",
