      "title": "Introduction",
      "content": "Persistent air-leak (PAL) is a clinical condition that is due to an abnormal communication between the pulmonary parenchyma and pleural space that persisted for more than 5 to 7 days, despite constant drainage of thoracic cavity (1). PALs present secondary to various etiologies and treatment can be a challenge due to the poor healing ability of diseased lung. Surgery with direct repair of the alveolar pleural fistula (APF) remains the treatment of choice but most patients are not surgical candidates due to poor general clinical condition. In 2001 an American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) consensus statement did not recommend bronchoscopy for the treatment of PAL (1,2). However, in the last two decades encouraging results have been reported in small case series (3-12) and review articles (13,14) by the use of bronchial valves, originally designed for management of emphysema. There are currently 2 commercially available types of bronchial valves; the Zephyr endobronchial valve (EBV) ( Zephyr, Pulmonx Corporation-Redwood City, CA , USA) and Spiration intra bronchial valves (IBV) (Olympus Respiratory America-Redmond, WA ,  USA). In the United States only the IBV has been approved for humanitarian use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating airleaks while in Europe the EBV has been approved for the management of emphysema and air-leaks. The valves differ in shape but have a similar mechanism that consists in preventing air entry during inspiration while allowing expiratory airflow and drainage of secretions. It limits the airleaks and favors the healing of APF. However, the lack of a standard protocol, and its high cost, remain the main drawbacks to allow it to be widely used in this procedure setting.\nThus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate in a large series of patients the efficacy of EBV in the management of PALs and the cost of the procedure.",

      "title": "Study design",
      "content": "This was a multicenter, retrospective study that included 6, high-volume Italian centers with relevant experience of the EBV procedure. Each participating center has treated more than 10 patients. The data of all consecutive patients with PALs observed from January 2011 to October 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Inclusion criteria were: (I) patients with airleaks due to APF that persisted for more than 5 days and were refractory to conventional treatments; (II)\npatients unfit or at high risk for surgery ; and (III) PALs that could not be controlled by a domiciliary pleural drainage system. Exclusion criteria were :  (I) patients with PALs due to broncho-pleural fistula; and ( II) patients with incomplete medical record and follow-up. Decisions regarding (I) the timing of EBVs implant and removal; (II) chest tube management; (III) performing additional procedures in case of EBV failure; and (IV) discharge planning were not standardized but directed by each participant center according to personal experience.\nThe end-points were: (I) to assess the efficacy of EBV treatment in air-leaks resolution and on allowing chest drainage removal; and (II) to evaluate the cost of the EBV procedure.\nAll patients were treated with Zephyr EBV (Zephyr, Pulmonx Corporation-Redwood City, CA , USA). In Europe, CE Mark cleared the use of EBVs for the treatment of emphysematous patients, and for damaged lung resulting in air-leaks (3-14). Thus, no specific approval by Institutional Review Board (IRB) was needed. Each patient signed a written informed consent for the treatment, and was aware of the pros and cons of procedure. The data, collected by each participating center, were retrospectively analyzed. The study design was approved by the Ethics Committee of University of Campania 'Luigi Vanvitelli', coordinating center of the study (Ethical approval number: 833.18).",

Air-leaks were assessed daily along the water compartment of the drainage system and classified according to the Cerfolio's classification (15) as following: grade 1 (forced expiratory only); grade 2 (expiratory only); grade 3 (inspiratory only); grade 4 (continuous). Chest-X ray and/or computed tomography scan (according to the preference of each treating center) were used to follow-up the target lung reexpansion after valve implant. When the air-leak stopped\nfollowing EBV placement, the chest tube was clamped for 12-24 hours and then removed, as indicated. Patients with PALs also after EBV treatment underwent additional treatments that were left to the treating physician. All patients were followed-up at 3-6 months for optional valve removal.",

      "content": "The type of anesthesia used during the procedure varied across  the  centers,  depending  on  patient  condition, and physician preference. Generally, the procedure was performed with IV sedation, spontaneous breathing, and flexible bronchoscopy. Alternatively, general anesthesia with either a laryngeal mask or endotracheal tube to provide positive airway pressure was used. To identify the source of air-leaks, a Fogarty Catheter was inserted into the lobar bronchus suspected of supplying the airleak. The catheter balloon was inflated, and the air leak rate was assessed through the chest tube 5 minutes later. If the air leak reduced, the procedure was repeated in each individual segment to identify the exact source of air-leak. If more than one segment was identified with an air-leak, the primary segment that supplied it was treated first; and if the air leak resolved, the remaining segments were not treated. Patients with PALs after balloon-occlusion technique were excluded from EBV treatment. T wo different size s of valves were used: EBV 4.0 and EBV 5.5 for bronchial lumens with diameters of 4.0-7.0 mm, and of 5.5-8.5 mm, respectively.\nAfter measuring the size of the target bronchus, the valve was delivered with the Zephyr Delivery Catheter while a continuous visual evaluation of the air-leak chamber assessed leak reduction.",

Iatrogenic pneumothorax occurred in 5 patients after a CT-guided fine-needle aspiration\nbiopsy to diagnose a lung lesion, and after malposition of a nasogastric tube in one patient.

( II) Due to the lack of standardization in suction level and the subjective assessment of air leaks, the timing of chest-tube removal was established by the treating physicians rather than being guided by predefined criteria. In theory, some patients could have unnecessarily had the chest tube in place for more days resulting in an underestimation of the clinical benefits of valve implantation.",
