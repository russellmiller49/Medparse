      "content": "The Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare in Japan estimated that there were approximately 112,000 new cases of and 70,300 deaths from lung cancer in 2011.\nApproximately  30%  of  patients  with  lung  cancer  also  have  airway  stenosis  [1].  Although  the standard  treatment  for  airway  stenosis  is  surgical  resection  and  reconstruction,  patients  with  central airway stenosis due to lung cancer are often poor surgical candidates based on either physiological or oncological criteria [1,2]. Therefore, these patients often require palliative intervention particularly for obstruction  or  bleeding  that  may  result  in  death.  Treatment  should  support  for  obstructions  such  as endoluminal, extraluminal, or infiltrating obstruction. Endobronchial treatment is commonly associated with  quick  symptom  improvement  and  limited  side  effects.  Endoluminal  obstructions  influence  the treatment  effect  of  external  beam  radiation  therapy,  photodynamic  therapy  (PDT),  laser  therapy,  or brachytherapy [3].\nPDT is recommended as curative for only small lesions ( ≤ 1.0 cm in diameter) in the 2003 American College of Chest Physicians guidelines [4]. However, Usuda et al . reported based on their experience with 264 lesions, that PDT treatment with Laserphyrin ®  prevents recurrence after complete remission (CR), regardless of tumor size [5] (maximum diameter in the longitudinal axis: <0.5 cm, 56 lesions; 0.5-0.9 cm, 124 lesions; 1.0-2.0 cm, 50 lesions; and >2.0 cm, 34 lesions). Although the CR rates were 94.6%, 93.5%, 80%, and 44.1%, respectively, the CR + PR rates were 100% for all lesion sizes [6].\nPDT or neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser treatment was also effective in terms of tumor response in 73% and 76% of patients, respectively, with tumors in the lobar or segmental bronchi [7]. Furthermore, PDT appears to be useful for treatment of obstructions in the lobar and segmental bronchi, when compared with Nd:YAG laser or radiotherapy, which usually affects all of the parts of the wall and damages collagen fibrils and smooth muscle. PDT is more selective than Nd:YAG laser and radiotherapy, sparing the collagen fibrils and enabling healing predominately by regeneration [8].\nIn  this  report,  we  evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  PDT  with  chemotherapy  for  advanced  lung cancer with airway stenosis. Symptoms and quality of life (QOL) were improved, and there was an objective  response  to  treatment,  with  increased  openings  of  the  bronchial  lumen  and  prevention  of obstructive pneumonia. Furthermore, the treatment appeared to be safe, when combined with standard therapeutic methods.",

      "title": "2.4. Discussion",
      "content": "Of  the  treatment  options  for  central  airway  stenosis,  we  chose  not  to  use  YAG  laser  therapy, brachytherapy, or extra beam radiation therapy for a number of reasons. High-power laser vaporization (Nd:YAG)  is  used  for  local  adjuvant  therapy  in  combination  with  radiotherapy,  chemotherapy, or airway stenting and primarily targets tumors occurring in large airways, from the trachea to the entries of segmental bronchi [9]; however, Nd:YAG laser therapy can cause complications such as hemorrhage, perforation,  fistulae  formation,  a  flame  in  the  airway,  and  pneumothorax.  Brachytherapy  can  cause complications such as hemoptysis (which may result in death), bronchial necrosis, airway fistulas to the  neighboring  structures,  fibrotic  stenosis,  and  radiation  bronchitis,  which  are  due  to  the  actual radiation effects. Radiation pneumonitis is the primary complication of extra beam radiation-therapy, and interstitial lung disease (ILD) is regarded in the Japanese Society for Therapeutic Radiation and Oncology clinical guidelines as a contraindication for stereotactic body radiation therapy [10] because the most dangerous complications are massive bleeding from blood vessel perforations or ILD. In the present study, PDT was performed safely, without perforation or ILD. Although PDT and conventional Nd:YAG laser therapy are equally effective and safe for airway obstructions in advanced non-small cell lung cancer, PDT results in better survival and has a longer time to treatment failure [11].\nIn the present study, bloody sputum production and obstructive pneumonia improved within 1 week after  PDT,  and  cough,  sputum,  and  dyspnea  production  improved  within  one  month  after  PDT. We  believe  that  the  speed  of  opening  the  airway  with  PDT  clears  the  obstructive  pneumonia. Because symptoms were improved with the reduction of the endobronchial tumor, KS also improved.\nThe  combination  of  PDT  and  chemotherapy  was  justified  to  improve  the  airway  obstruction symptoms and KS in these patients with lung cancer airway obstruction. PDT attempts to control internal bronchial tumor growth, and the additional systemic chemotherapy provides certain benefits for survival with advanced lung cancer. Similarly, Hong et al . reported that treatment with systemic chemotherapy and PDT might produce a synergistic effect that improves survival and QOL for patients with advanced bile duct cancer [12]. In an in vivo study using a nude mouse model, the tumor necrotic area, percentage of apoptosis-positive cells, and percentage of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-producing cells were significantly higher in the group treated with a therapy with combined chemotherapy and PDT than in the groups treated with chemotherapy alone or PDT alone [13].\nIt has been reported that PDT induces oxidative stress, localized inflammation, and vascular injury within treatment fields, and these responses resulted in an increase in the expression of angiogenesis factors and cytokines [14]. Ferrario et al . reported that VEGF inhibitors or cyclooxygenase-2 increased the  effectiveness  of  PDT  [15].  Tumor  bleeding  disappeared  just  after  PDT  in  the  present  study. Because of the early stage, PDT-induced microvascular damage and the resulting hypoxia could activate molecular events that lead to the increased expression of VEGF within the treated tumor tissue.\nThe  limitations  of  this  study  are  the  relatively  small  number  of  patients,  retrospective  nature, and single institution. Further prospective randomized trials are needed to compare the ability of this technique with other additional procedures to prevent symptoms of airway obstruction and improve QOL. If the results are supported by additional studies, we recommend that these procedures be adopted as standard therapy.",
