According to current clinical practice guidelines, a minimally invasive approach is strongly recommended for patients with pulmonary nodules or lesions suspected of lung cancer. 2 For lesions proximal to central airways, procedures such as endobronchial ultrasound needle aspiration have a sensitivity of > 90% and a speci /uniFB01 city of > 95% for diagnosis and mediastinal staging. 2,3 Although evidence regarding suspicious lesions near the central airways is strong, accuracy for peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs) suspected of lung cancer is variable. Furthermore, data regarding the accuracy of radial endobronchial ultrasound needle aspiration (r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)) is only fair, with the AQuIRe registry reporting a diagnostic yield of 57%. 4 In an attempt to improve the yield, several image-\nguided biopsy diagnostic tools have been developed in the last decade. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) allows physicians to access PPLs beyond the reach of conventional bronchoscopy through a minimally invasive method, using an image-guided /uniFB02 exible catheter and a dedicated navigation software system (superDimension [Medtronic], SpiNDrive [Veran], etc). 5 This procedure is an alternative to transthoracic needle aspiration (TTNA), a procedure with a sensitivity for detecting malignancy of 92.1%. 6 Despite displaying a good sensitivity for cancer diagnosis, TTNA accounts for pneumothorax rates of 25.3% when core biopsy is performed and 18.8% when /uniFB01 ne needle aspiration is performed, requiring chest tube placement in up to 11.9% of cases. 7\nThis systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the sensitivity and safety of ENB for the sampling of PPLs suspected of lung cancer.",

      "title": "Literature Search",
      "content": "A highly sensitive database search was conducted by a review author (G. L.), without language restriction, using the following databases: PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase, LILACS (www.scielo.org), Clinical Trials (ClinicalTrials.gov), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ScienceDirect (www.sciencedirect.com), Scirus (www.scirus. com/srsapp), ISI Web of Knowledge (www.isiwebofknowledge.com), and Google Scholar (http://scholar.google.com). An initial literature search was performed in May 2019 and updated in November 2019. References from the included studies were also manually searched along with the abstracts of potential studies presented in conferences from 2014 through 2019 by the American Thoracic Society, American College of Chest Physicians, European Respiratory Society,\nand American Association for Bronchology & Interventional Pulmonology. The full literature search strategy is available in eAppendix 1.\nInclusion Criteria: Criteria for inclusion were as follows: (1) ENB used for diagnosis of PPLs, (2) diagnosis con /uniFB01 rmed histologically or by close clinical follow-up, and (3) studies that stated a clear reference standard for establishing diagnostic sensitivity. We excluded review papers, letters, or studies in which data to calculate sensitivity for malignancy was insuf /uniFB01 cient. Studies were selected for inclusion only after both reviewers assessed the full text.\nSelection of Studies: The references identi /uniFB01 ed after the literature search were included in Covidence software (Veritas Health Innovation Ltd). A highly speci /uniFB01 c hand search screening of both titles and abstracts was independently performed by two review authors (G. L. and D. O.-D.). Eligible studies were evaluated in full text and selected according to our prespeci /uniFB01 ed inclusion and exclusion criteria; any disagreement was resolved by discussion.\nData Extraction and Quality Assessment: Two independent reviewers (G. L. and D. O.-D.) extracted data from each study. The following information was collected: /uniFB01 rst author, publication year, publication type (retrospective or prospective), number of participants, index test, reference standard, number of techniques, true positives (TPs), false positives (FPs), true negatives (TNs), false negatives (FNs), use of rapid on-site examination (ROSE) (yes or no), nodule size, /uniFB02 uoroscopy use (yes or no), r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) use (yes or no), cancer prevalence, and successful navigation to the target lesion. Cancer prevalence was de /uniFB01 ned as the total lung cancer cases (TPs þ FNs) divided by the total population included in each study. Successful navigation was de /uniFB01 ned as the number of lesions in which navigation was successful divided by the number of lesions in which navigation was attempted.\nQuality assessment was performed using the QUADAS-2 tool 9 by two reviewers (G. L. and D. O.-D.). We rated the risk of bias because of\nBeth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA; the Virginia Cancer Specialists (Dr Khandhar), Inova Health, Fairfax, VA; the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr Mehta and Jantz), University of Florida, Gainesville, FL; and the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care, Mayo Clinic (Dr Fernandez-Bussy), Jacksonville, FL.\nFUNDING/SUPPORT: The authors have reported to CHEST that no funding was received for this study.\nCORRESPONDENCE TO: Erik E.

Finally, we rated the overall risk of bias and categorized it as low risk or high risk according to the results of the QUADAS-2 analysis. Any disagreement was resolved by a third reviewer (F. K.).\nData Analysis: Pooled data were analyzed and imported in a two-bytwo contingency table. The principle outcome was de /uniFB01 ned as the pooled sensitivity of ENB for malignancy (lung cancer). Sensitivity was calculated as TP/TP þ FN, including the total navigation cases (successful and nonsuccessful navigation). Speci /uniFB01 city (TN/TN þ FP), negative likelihood ratio, and positive likelihood ratio were also reported. For quantitative analyses, we performed a proportions meta-analysis after a binomial distribution. 10 We used the metaprop command with a Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation on STATA software version 14.2 (Stata Corp) 11 and Open Meta Analyst software (Brown University). 12 We also created a summary receiver operatic characteristic curve. 10,13 All results were expressed as a percentage and a 95% CI with an alpha value of 0.05.\nInterstudy heterogeneity (percentage of total variation across studies that is caused by heterogeneity rather than chance) was measured using visual inspection of a forest plot and an I 2 test. Signi /uniFB01 cant heterogeneity was de /uniFB01 ned as an I 2 > 75% and nonsigni /uniFB01 cant was de /uniFB01 ned as I 2 < 40% according to previous publications. 14 In the case of signi /uniFB01 cant heterogeneity, subgroup analysis evaluating possible explanations of the difference between groups was explored. 15 We prespeci /uniFB01 ed the following variables as potential subgroups: (1) risk of bias of included studies, (2) type of navigation system used (superDimension or others), (3) use of ROSE, (4) use of /uniFB02 uoroscopy guidance, (5) type of anesthesia (general, conscious sedation, or both), (6) r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) use, (7) time interval in which the study was performed, and (8) number of sampling techniques used in association to ENB. Finally, heterogeneity between subgroups was assessed with a Q test.\nThe potential for publication bias was evaluated through both visual inspection of the funnel plot and Egger test. Asymmetry in the distribution of the studies in the funnel plot raised concerns about serious publication bias. 16\nComplementary Analysis: Adequacy of the Sample Achieved by ENB and Association Between Sensitivity and Covariables: A random effects model was used in cases in which heterogeneity between studies was high. A /uniFB01 xed random effects model was used in cases in which this heterogeneity was low. For overall sensitivity, both models were used, and results were compared. We performed two complementary data analyses. For the /uniFB01 rst analysis, we explored the association between pooled sensitivity for the diagnosis of malignancy and continuous variables related to ENB procedure through a metaregression. The dependent variable was de /uniFB01 ned as the pooled sensitivity for lung cancer. We used the following independent continuous covariables related to ENB procedures to run the model: cancer prevalence, distance between tip of sensor and center of nodule, duration of the procedure, number of sampling techniques used in association to ENB, and nodule size. 17 For the second complementary analysis, we explored the adequacy of samples obtained through ENB to test for driver oncogenes. In this case, we performed a binary effect meta-analysis after a maximum likelihood method. A suf /uniFB01 cient sample was de /uniFB01 ned as a sample obtained using ENB that allowed the performance of the ancillary test. For calculation, we used the proportion of participants in which a suf /uniFB01 cient sample was achieved relative to all participants in which a sample for ancillary testing was attempted as an effect measure.\nSafety Analysis: Additionally, we reviewed the safety of ENB by assessing the proportion of patients that developed the following adverse events: (1) pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement; (2) minor bronchopulmonary bleeding, de /uniFB01 ned as bleeding that stopped spontaneously in < 5 min or with the use of a Fogarty balloon; (3) major bronchopulmonary bleeding, de /uniFB01 ned as bleeding that did not meet minor bleeding criteria; (4) acute respiratory failure; and (5) need for a repeat biopsy.\nThe effect measure used was the proportion of participants who developed the adverse event relative to all the participants included in each study.\nFinally, we created a summary of /uniFB01 ndings table of the diagnostic test results, 18 and the quality of evidence was rated by a panel (G. L. and F. K.) following the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.",

      "content": "This systematic review and meta-analysis showed the following: (1) ENB has an overall sensitivity of 77%, a speci /uniFB01 city of 100%, a positive likelihood ratio of 15.79, and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.23 for diagnosing PPLs suspected of lung cancer; (2) potential sources of heterogeneity were seen in both risk of bias and number of sampling techniques, with no signi /uniFB01 cant heterogeneity between subgroups noted when navigation system, ROSE, /uniFB02 uoroscopy guidance, anesthesia type, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), or time interval in which the study was performed; (3) sensitivity was associated with lung cancer prevalence, number of sampling techniques used, and mean distance between the tip of the sensor and the center of the nodule; (4) ENB is a very safe procedure with a 2.0% risk of pneumothorax and a risk of any bleeding or respiratory failure of < 1%; and (5) ENB can obtain adequate samples for testing driver oncogenes in 90% of positive biopsies in which additional testing is needed.\nSensitivity was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.72-0.82), speci /uniFB01 city was 1.00 (95% CI, 0.99-1.00), and prevalence was 66%. Prevalence was estimated using a pooled analysis of included studies. a Pretest probability from the pooled prevalence of lung cancer from included studies. Values shown are number of positive tests reported as test per 1,000 participants, and 95% CI is included in parentheses. b Bias because of difference regarding the navigation success de /uniFB01 nition used across studies, which is a potential source of selective reporting. c We downgraded because of signi /uniFB01 cant residual heterogeneity in each subgroup.\nPreviously, three systematic reviews have been published on the topic. Wang Memoli et al 59 quantitatively analyzed 39 studies (prior to 2010) that described alternative PPL exploration techniques (r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), ENB, etc). The authors reported a diagnostic yield for any diagnoses of 70%, with a pneumothorax rate of 1.5%. 59 A study by Gex et al 60 described the diagnostic accuracy for any diagnoses of ENB including 15 trials with an overall accuracy of 73.9%, a sensitivity of 71.1%, and a risk of pneumothorax of 3.1%. Finally, Zhang et al 61\nincluded 17 studies of ENB with a pooled sensitivity for cancer diagnoses of 82%, a speci /uniFB01 city of 100%, a positive likelihood ratio of 19.36, and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.23. In the present meta-analysis, 40 studies were quantitatively analyzed, including the results of the US cohort for the largest prospective multicenter study, NAVIGATE. 57\nHeterogeneity was high, likely because of a number of factors, including the prevalence of cancer in each study, the average distance between the tip of the sensor and\nN.A. ¼ not applicable; ROSE ¼ rapid on-site examination. See Table 1 legend for expansion of other abbreviation.\n]\nthe center of the nodule, and the number of sampling techniques used in each study. These variables are related to differences in sensitivity across studies. Other variables with nonsigni /uniFB01 cant statistical differences included /uniFB02 uoroscopy use, ROSE use, r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), anesthesia type, the time interval in which the study was performed, and average nodule size. Different time intervals had similar pooled sensitivities except for 2015 to 2016.\nThe present analysis also explored the role of the speci /uniFB01 c navigation software used (superDimension vs others). Different navigation software have described similar sensitivity; however, there was a wide variation in diagnostic de /uniFB01 nitions. Research on other systems is sparse compared with superDimension; therefore, the conclusion of these analyses is not applicable to other navigation systems. Our data are only applicable for ENB using the superDimension system.\nFigure 3 -Forest plot. Risk of pneumothorax after electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy. PPL ¼ peripheral pulmonary lesion. See Figure 2 legend for expansion of other abbreviation.\nCompared with other methods, TTNA has historically been the preferred diagnostic method to explore PPLs to avoid unnecessary surgery. TTNA has a pooled sensitivity for cancer diagnosis of 92.1%, with a trend toward lower sensitivity in lesions < 2 cm and in lesions located in the lower lobes, making this an attractive choice in patients with solitary lung lesions without mediastinal or hilar adenopathy. 6,62 However, the overall rate of complications is 24% to 39%, with a risk of pneumothorax ranging between 19% and 25%, depending on the sampling method used. 63 Alternatively, we found that ENB is a safe procedure with < 3% overall complications. These /uniFB01 ndings are similar to previously reported ones, with the most common complication being pneumothorax, occurring in approximately 2% of patients. Considering these factors, it can be said that the use of ENB is a safe alternative to TTNA, especially in those patients with an increased risk of complications because of comorbidities.\nOn the other hand, traditional bronchoscopy has shown variable diagnostic accuracy for total diagnoses for PPLs, as shown by the AQuIRE database. 4 r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) has been proposed in the literature as an alternative to increase the diagnostic yield of the previously mentioned technique. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis reported a pooled sensitivity for cancer diagnosis of 72% for PPLs (95% CI, 70%-75%; I 2 ¼ 76%), with a pooled risk of pneumothorax of 0.7% (95% CI, 0.3%-1.1%). 64 Although sensitivity improved when r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) was used, it is dif /uniFB01 cult to draw conclusions because heterogeneity in the mentioned meta-analysis was high. The addition of other techniques, such as ROSE, endobronchial ultrasound needle aspiration, or /uniFB02 uoroscopy did not increase diagnostic sensitivity, as seen in previous studies. 65\nENB should be performed with biopsy tools designed to achieve a suf /uniFB01 cient sample size for analysis. Our data suggest that the use of three biopsy tools may increase sensitivity to 83%. However, whenever more than four biopsy tools were used, sensitivity dropped to 71%. Drawing conclusions based on these data is dif /uniFB01 cult given the signi /uniFB01 cant heterogeneity between groups as seen with a positive Q test. A prospective study designed to look at this is necessary to corroborate these /uniFB01 ndings.\nPrecision medicine requires a comprehensive approach including the determination of driver oncogenes. Studies describe the percentage of adequate samples where these ancillary tests were performed (molecular testing, /uniFB02 ow cytometry, etc). Pooled data from 610 participants showed that when ENB was used, 90% of samples were\nsuf /uniFB01 cient for ancillary tests; this proportion is similar to other minimally invasive methods such as endobronchial ultrasound needle aspiration. 66,67 However, only three studies included data about this topic, and future research incorporating data on the ability to achieve a suf /uniFB01 cient sample for ancillary tests is necessary. At the time of this publication, international guidelines do not recommend the analysis of driver oncogenes in stage I non-small cell lung cancer, and this is likely to impact the number of available cases for analysis.\nThis paper was performed according to current recommendations. In the present meta-analysis, a random effects model was prede /uniFB01 ned because of high heterogeneity between subgroups. This method is strongly recommended in cases of signi /uniFB01 cant interstudy heterogeneity. 14 This approach was based on the binomial distribution as the bivariate model, rather than the DerSimonian and Laird random effects model, because the latter model approximates within-study variability of an outcome by a normal distribution, a method that biases diagnostic test results. 10\nWe found the following limitations. First, the presence of an airway sign and distance of the nodule from the pleura were inconsistently reported between different studies; therefore, it was not possible to do subgroup analyses of sensitivity with these variables. Second, we used a trial-level analysis (both subgroup and metaregression analysis) without patient-speci /uniFB01 c data; therefore, our /uniFB01 ndings should be viewed as exploratory. 68 Although we found a biological plausibility between studies with both increased prevalence and average nodule size, those variables are strongly associated with an increased pretest probability of positive samples achieved by any bronchoscopic procedure. However, the results of our meta-regression should be interpreted with caution, and further patientlevel data would be necessary to evaluate the potential predictive value of these variables and sensitivity.\nFinally, the /uniFB01 ndings of this systematic review and metaanalysis should inform future research on minimally invasive procedures after a precision medicine approach. We emphasize the importance of considering the human and technologic capital available at each institution to provide patients with the lowest procedural risk while maintaining an adequate sensitivity for tissue diagnosis. In some cases, the presence of mediastinal involvement or pleural effusion will dictate a different diagnostic strategy or a procedure that can be combined under the same anesthetic episode.\n]",
