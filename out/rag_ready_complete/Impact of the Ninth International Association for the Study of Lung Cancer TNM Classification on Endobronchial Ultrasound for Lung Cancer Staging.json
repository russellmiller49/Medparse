    "abstract": "The forthcoming 9th IASLC TNM lung cancer classification subdivides N2 disease into N2a (single mediastinal nodal station) and N2b (multiple mediastinal stations), a change that directly affects invasive mediastinal staging strategies. The authors argue that, to stage T1–T3 tumors accurately under this schema, endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) should systematically sample all ipsilateral mediastinal and subcarinal stations—expanding beyond a single most-suspicious N2 node—and, when indicated by PET-CT uptake, extend to inferior mediastinal stations via EUS-b. They further note Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE) remains valuable for ensuring representativeness and reducing unnecessary passes, even as more stations are sampled. The letter calls for prospective validation of PET-CT and sonographic features that might safely exempt minute or low-SUV N2 nodes from biopsy.

      "content": "The forthcoming ninth edition of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer Lung Cancer (IASLC) TNM classi /uniFB01 cation for lung cancer introduces a signi /uniFB01 cant change for lymph node staging of lung cancer compared with the eighth edition. This ninth edition has a key re /uniFB01 nement in the N category, namely the subdivision of N2 into N2a (single N2 station involvement) and N2b (multiple N2 station involvement). This subdivision allows for a more precise description of the extent of lymph node involvement, which can be critical for determining the appropriate treatment strategy and prognosis. 1\nEndobronchial ultrasound (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)) is currently the most frequently used method for lung cancer staging and has been recommended over mediastinoscopy for initial pathologic mediastinal staging due to its high accuracy and better safety pro /uniFB01 le. It is also preferred for patients with a positron emission tomography -computed tomography (PET-CT) normal mediastinum and primary tumor larger than 3 cm, central tumors, or cN1 disease to detect occult N2/N3 disease. 2\nThese re /uniFB01 nements in the N category bring new challenges for the clinical practice of those who perform Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS). Previously, after puncturing station N3, it would be expected to puncture the N2 lymph node that is most suspicious of malignancy, according to PET-CT and ultrasound features. It would also be reasonable to puncture only one N2 lymph node if it presented highly suggestive features of malignancy. 3 Considering the ninth IASLC TNM classi /uniFB01 cation and the major impact of the N2a and N2b subdivision on the /uniFB01 nal staging of T1-3 tumors, it becomes imperative to puncture all the ipsilateral mediastinal and subcarinal stations. This is also expected to increase the number of punctures at mediastinal stations that were less frequently sampled, such as the upper paratracheal nodes (2R/L). A detailed description by nuclear medicine consultants regarding PET-CT uptake of each mediastinum-hilar lymph node also becomes increasingly relevant. For example, inferior mediastinal nodes as the paraesophageal (station 8) and the pulmonary ligament (station 9) nodes may require puncture if they have signi /uniFB01 cant uptake on PET-CT, in which case Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) with bronchoscopy (EUS-b) should be performed after Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS). 4 It is anticipated that staging Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) will need to be an even more precise, comprehensive, and timeconsuming examination with an anticipated increase in the number of punctured lymph node stations.\nMastering the N2 lymph node stations according to the IASLC guidelines becomes imperative during staging Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) (Fig. 1). In addition, a thorough understanding of ultrasound references is crucial to reliably differentiate, for instance, between an ipsilateral station 1 (N3) and an ipsilateral station 2 (N2).\nRegarding the Rapid On-site Evaluation (ROSE) technique, the need to puncture more than one N2 lymph node implies that ROSE plays a less active role in the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) staging process. Nevertheless, ROSE remains highly relevant for identifying representative samples and malignant cells during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and may save a few punctures to the usual three that are recommended for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) lung cancer staging when ROSE is not available. 3\nAccording to previous literature, lymph nodes with short axis size less than 5 mm could be exempt from puncture. Furthermore, lymph nodes that present SUVmax less than 1.85 and short axis size less than 4.28 mm are\nAddress correspondence to: Nuno Faria, MD, Pulmonology Department, Centro Hospitalar e Universitário de Santo António, Hospital de Santo António, Largo Prof. Abel Salazar, 4099-001, Porto, Portugal.

      "content": "In their letter to the editor, Faria et al. 1 have proved full understanding of the clinical implications of the subdivision of category N2 into N2a (involvement of a single N2 nodal station) and N2b (involvement of multiple N2 stations) that will be introduced in the forthcoming ninth edition of the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation of lung cancer. They highlight the importance of a thorough endobronchial ultrasound (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)) transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) and endoscopic ultrasound/uniFB01 ne-needle aspiration in the staging of lung cancer, the adherence to the clinical guidelines when performing the procedure, and the changing relevance of rapid on-site examination, if available.\nIn addition to the thoughtful comments by Faria et al., 1 we emphasize that during invasive mediastinal staging, systematic sampling is preferred than targeted random sampling. A study comparing targeted with systematic Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA reported that, among 107 patients with clinical N2 by positron emission tomographycomputed tomography (PET-CT), targeted Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA misclassi /uniFB01 ed 14 of 47 (30%) tumors classi /uniFB01 ed as N2a. Systematic Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA revealed that 11 were N2b and three were N3. 2 Moreover, with the new changes in the subdivision of N2, the role of rapid on-site examination will even be more relevant. It has been reported that, after sampling a malignant lymph node, the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA needle can be contaminated by malignant cells and, therefore, can\nbe a source of false-positive results. The on-site cytopathologist is essential to determine whether a mediastinal node is malignant and, accordingly, to change the needle before exploring the rest of nodal stations. 3\nFaria et al. 1 do not elaborate on the indications of surgical invasive staging. The European Society of Thoracic Surgeons guidelines on preoperative nodal mediastinal staging recommend the con /uniFB01 rmation of a negative Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA and endoscopic ultrasound/uniFB01 ne-needle aspiration result when the mediastinal lymph nodes are abnormal by PET-CT and when the mediastinum is normal but tumors are more than 3 cm in largest dimension, are centrally located, there is suspicion of N1 involvement, or the tumor is known to be adenocarcinoma with low uptake on PET. In these circumstances, con /uniFB01 rmation with a minimally invasive surgical procedure (usually mediastinoscopy) is indicated. 4 The results of a clinical trial comparing Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA with mediastinoscopy for staging clinical N1 NSCLCs revealed that sensitivity and negative predictive values of mediastinoscopy were higher than those of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA: sensitivity of 0.73 and 0.38 and negative predictive value of 0.91 and 0.81, respectively. 5 These results imply that, when the mediastinum is normal on PET-CT, mediastinoscopy enhances nodal staging and could be the initial staging test instead of ultrasound-guided endoscopies.\nThe ninth edition TNM for lung cancer increases our understanding of the prognostic impact of the anatomical tumor extent on the condition that the tumor is staged with the highest certainty. To this respect, the comments by Faria et al. 1 are highly appreciated and welcome.",
