The laser used was the Nd:YAG (YM 100 Cilas, Paris) whose technical features are well known, 4 Normallg we used power settings ranging from 40 to 50 W with pulse duration ofO.7-1.2 s. With large tumors we often used longer exposure times (several seconds) at 35 to 40 ~ and with nonmalignant tracheal stenoses, shorter exposure (0.5 s) at 70 to 80 W The ftexible bronchoscope was used alone in 116 (eight percent) treatments, all with patients under local anesthesia. The rigid bronchoscope was used for 1,280 (92 percent) procedures, 1,088 with patients under general and 192 with patient under local anesthesia. The latter mostly refer to our first year of activity when, unlike today anesthetists were not available on a regular basis. We frequently used the rigid bronchoscope to dilate some types of tracheal stenoses and, in polypoid tumors, to scoop out the endoluminal mass, following Dumons technique.8.15 With neoplasms, the laser was used initially to coagulate the mass with low power (25 to 30 W) and long pulse times (5 s~ After mechanical removal of the tumor, the airway wall was photocoagulated for hemostasis.

Of the 593 patients with bronchogenic carcinoma, 87 were treated two or more times for recurrence. The median time between first and second treatment was III days. Occasionally after laser resec› tion, neoplastic infiltration of the bronchial wall was sometimes seen to be more distal than had originally been thought. This allowed resective surgery in eight cases originally felt to be inoperable, and in another ten patients it allowed less extensive surgery than planned.\nBy far, the most common malignant cell type was squamous cell carcinoma (451, 69.5 percent), followed by adenocarcinomas (48, 7.4 percent), small cell car› cinomas (36, 5.5 percent) and large cell carcinomas (24, 3.7 percent). There also were 19 rare tumors: five carcinosarcomas, five carcinomas in situ , two sarco› mas, two malignant plasmocytomas, one teratoma and four malignant lymphomas (two Hodgkins and two non-Hodgkins). Metastatic tumors included 15 from the thyroid, seven from the kidney, five from the\nalmost always achieved in a single laser session, were invariably good and often spectacular. In the 592 bronchogenic carcinomas alone, we achieved a normal airway lumen gauge or a significant improvement in ventilation in 548 (92.4 percent). In only 45 (7.6 percent) did the laser have no effect; these were mainly obstructions due to external compression or extensive tumor extending distally Histologic tumor cell type had no important bearing on results; normal airway lumen or significant improvement in ventilation was obtained in 93 percent of patients with squamous cell carcinoma, 92 percent with large cell carcinoma, 90 percent with adenocarcinoma and 90 percent with small cell carcinoma. Location of the tumor was a major determinant of outcome (Fig 2).\nIt is difficult to draw conclusions regarding long› term results, since TNM restaging and performance status cannot be determined. Also, other therapies prior to and following laser treatment varied consid› erably\nThe cumulative survival percentages after the first laser treatment for 333 patients with bronchogenic carcinoma was 50 percent (-3 percent) at six months and 26 percent (-3 percent) at one year (Fig 3). Follow-up information was not available in 242 patients. Those who underwent surgery after laser resection are not included in the survival data. More important than length of survival was the obvious improvement in quality of life. It is worth noting that almost all patients with known data and cause of death died without recurrent obstructive symptoms.",

      "content": "The main complications were hypoxemia and related cardiovascular disorders induced by general anesthesia or severe hemorrhage (Table 6). In 1,396 treatments, we had ten hemorrhages of over 250 ml, all during surgery. Allwere managed without excessive difficulty and did not extend hospitalization times. Two medi› astinal emphysemas cleared spontaneously in five and six days. Four pneumothoraxes developed, probably due to reexpansion of atelectatic lung. Two cleared spontaneously in three and five days. The other two cleared in six and eight days with pleural drainage.\nThere were five deaths, giving a mortality rate of 0.35 percent (5 of 1,396). One patient with recurrent bronchogenic carcinoma died of myocardial infarction during treatment under local anesthesia. The other four deaths occurred in patients treated under general anesthesia. One patient with bronchogenic carcinoma died at the end of the treatment from a cardiac arrest. In the other patient with Hodgkins lymphoma, previ› ously treated with radiotherapy, the laser did not improve the tracheobronchial lumen, which was se› verely reduced mainly due to extrinsic compression. The patient died from respiratory failure 18 hours after treatment. Another had tracheobronchial stenosis after left tracheal sleeve pneumonectomy. Although good improvement of the stenotic airway was achieved, the patient died five hours later from respiratory failure. One patient with bronchogenic carcinoma suffered a severe myocardial infarction during laser treatment and died five days later despite intensive care.\nanesthesia in 23 procedures (Table 5). Resection of suture threads and bronchial granulomas and control of mild hemorrhages is normally easy and complete. On the other hand, bronchial stenoses following sleeve resection are very difficult to treat and frequently recur: five out of 12 in this series.\nWith fistulas, the laser was used to clean the fistulized zone of suture threads and necrotic tissue . Using this technique, four small fistulas closed spon› taneously, four medium-gauge ones closed after re› peated silver nitrate treatment, and one remained open.\nThe tubercular bronchial stenoses were particularly difficult to treat. Wenever managed to obtain a normal bronchial lumen caliber. But ventilation did appear to improve and was maintained.\nDysplasias were treated in an attempt to arrest their evolution into frank cancer. We used low-power (25 W) to kill the atypical cells without damaging the bronchial wall. Follow-upbiopsies of the treated areas at three and 12 months showed fibrous tissue.",

      "content": "Twodifferent methods of laser application in bron› chology have been developed: via the rigid or the fiberoptic bronchoscope. In general, the flexible method is opted for by bronchoscopists who have little or no experience with the rigid bronchoscope.\nThe preference for the rigid bronchoscope by au› thors with the largest series of cases\" and by ourselves is essentially for safety reasons: using the wide oper› ating channel, the patient can be ventilated, blood and secretions aspirated, and laser coagulation util› ized. Furthermore, the rigid bronchoscope allows instrumental dilatation of nonneoplastic tracheobron› chial stenoses and mechanical resection of polypoid tumors with considerable savings of time.\nIn regard to our personal preference in using the laser on a continuous basis with pulses as long as 5 to 6 s at 35 W on large tumors, it must be pointed out that the laser is not directed onto a single point but is waved slowly over the surface of the tumor always on a course nearly parallel to the tracheobronchial walls. With this technique, we have never produced the dangerous \"popcorn\" effect due to vaporization of submucosal tissues or postoperative hemorrhage. Dur› ing the days immediately after therapy we have noted at the site of laser treatment a moderate production of fibrin debris, which is expectorated spontaneously in seven to ten days. Endoscopic removal can be symp› tomatologically useful but we have never found it really indispensable.",

      "title": "Results",
      "content": "The results appear to be more than satisfactory which enables us to confirm the utility of the laser in treating various tracheobronchial lesions. With inop› erable malignant tumors, the laser has proved to be of valuable help, mainly in improving quality of life. Particularly suitable for laser therapy are tumors blocking the main stem bronchi and/or the trachea, ie, those causing severe dyspnea not likely to be tolerated for long. Laser treatment in these cases offers a number of advantages: it is rapid, immediately effective, repeatable and complementary with other therapies. Radiotherapy is useful after laser in cases of widespread intramural infiltration with an extralu› minal component.\nThe possibility of more accurately assessing the actual extent of neoplastic infiltration after reductive laser therapy is extremely interesting, since some patients originally thought to be inoperable can be sent to surgery while others can undergo less extensive surgery than expected.\nThe laser has also proved to be extremely useful in allowing drainage of purulent secretions distal to\nairway obstruction. This can prevent the serious com› plications of postobstructive sepsis, often improving the patients overall condition even if there is little or no improvement in lung function.\nIt is difficult to make a judgment of the long-term results. While we feel it may not be correct to state this as a criterion for evaluating the effectiveness of laser therapy we are in agreement with Brutinel et aP7in believing that it extends the duration of life.\nIn regard to bronchial carcinoids, we wish to point out that laser therapy can be curative in exclusively endoluminal polypoid forms. In an attempt to eradi› cate all tumor in these cases, as for benign polypoid tumors, we treat the base with a lower power setting, thus avoiding tissue loss while still obtaining a cytocidal effect.\nFor many benign tumors that are exclusively endol› uminal and polypoid, total removal with laser is often possible. Laser therapy for such lesions must be considered in preference to surgery\nIn nonmalignant tracheal stenoses, though we did not obtain particularly extraordinary results, we are convinced that the laser is extremely useful for restor› ing ventilation rapidly particularly in emergencies. With recurrent tracheal stenoses the laser affords time for assessment of more definitive therapy such as silicone T-tube insertion or sleeve resection.\nIn summary we have treated 1,000 patients with the Nd-YAG laser in 1,396 applications during five years. Ninety-two percent of the treatments were performed via the rigid bronchoscope, the other eight percent with a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope. Our experience confirms the usefulness and safety of this relatively new technique for treating benign and malignant obstructing lesions of the tracheobronchial tree.",
