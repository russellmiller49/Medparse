It results from the pooling of secretions at the back of the throat and airways and typically heralds the last few hours to days before death. 11 The causes of dyspnea in advanced lung cancer include parenchymal destruction, airway obstruction, pleural effusions, pulmonary embolism, superior vena cava obstruction, muscle weakness, and so forth. 4 Symptoms from nonmalignant pulmonary diseases overlap the symptoms previously described for malignant diseases. In fact, some studies suggest that the symptom burden of nonmalignant diseases may even be higher than malignant diseases. 12 Although dyspnea is the most serious symptom encountered in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), other symptoms include fatigue, depression, anxiety, weight loss, and insomnia. 13",

      "title": "Why Palliative Care?",
      "content": "The goal of palliative care is to relieve the suffering experienced by the patients and their caregivers. This relief is accomplished by comprehensive assessment and management of afflictions in physical, psychosocial, existential, and spiritual domains. 3 The role of palliative care just does not end there. As Dame Cicely Saunders, father of the modern hospice movement, famously said: 'How people die lives on in the memories of those who live on.' 4 In line with this spirit, after patients pass away, palliative care focuses on providing support to the bereaved family. 14 Recent studies have shown that instituting palliative care is associated with greater use of symptom control medications and improved quality-of-life scores. 15\nThe common practice has been of following a dichotomousapproach,wherebythepatientswould initially get aggressive life-prolonging or curative therapies and at some point they would be transitionedtopalliative care. The Center toAdvancePalliative Care has countered this notion. They have advocated that palliative care is appropriate at any age and stage of a serious illness and can be provided along with curative treatment. 16 Temel and colleagues 17 reported a trial of newly diagnosed metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whereby patients were randomized to either palliative care with standard oncologic care or standard oncologic care alone. The patients in the early palliative care group had improvements in the quality-of-life and depression scores. Interestingly, these patients were less likely to receive aggressive therapies and yet their median survival was longer than patients receiving standard oncologic care alone. Other investigators have also reported improved 1-year\nsurvival with early palliative care consultation. 18 Despite these unequivocal benefits, unfortunately, trends show that palliative care is underutilized and the proportion of patients getting aggressive medical therapies toward the end of their lives is increasing. 19",

      "title": "Underutilization of Palliative Care",
      "content": "There are multiple reasons behind the underutilization of palliative care. Firstly, significant knowledge gaps exist when determining the most potent and cost-effective palliative care interventions. Aslakson and colleagues 20 determined key areas that should be the subject of future research to address these knowledge gaps. Secondly, even though the availability of palliative care has increased over the last few years, significant disparities still exist globally. 21 Even within developed countries, comprehensive palliative care teams are less likely to be available in safety-net hospitals. As a result, ethnic minorities, immigrants, and underprivileged patients face greater barriers to seeking palliative care. Thirdly, often times, no distinction is made between palliative care on the one hand and hospice and end-of-life (EOL) care on the other. 22 Although hospice care is generally reserved for patients in their last 6 months of life, palliative care is appropriate at any stage of a serious illness. 23 Given this confusion in terminology, patients are likely to have misconceptions that by opting for palliative care, they will be deprived of other potential disease-modifying therapies. It needs to be emphasized to the patients that although palliative care is an indispensable component of high-quality EOL care, it should not be limited to just the EOL. 3 Fourthly, patients and at times even physicians tend to think that palliative care is only appropriate for patients with cancer. Brown and colleagues 24 reported that among the patients dying in the intensive care unit, patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and ILD received fewer elements of palliative care as compared with the patients with lung cancer. Other investigators have also reported discrepancies in palliative care involvement and EOL care discussions in patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Palliative care should be embraced for all patients with life-threatening illnesses, regardless of their cancer status. 7\nSome of the aforementioned issues can be addressed by increasing awareness regarding the role and scope of palliative care among primary care physicians, pulmonologists, and oncologists, so that they may, in turn, be more open to having this discussion with their patients. Investigators have also looked at other innovative strategies to enhance the delivery of palliative care. One such strategy is to increase the availability of palliative\ncare in the outpatient setting. Skorstengaard and colleagues 25 found that for most of the terminally ill patients, home was the preferred place of care and the preferred place of death. Care at home can be maximized by making the elements of palliative care available in the ambulatory setting. Follwell andcolleagues 26 reportedsignificant improvements in pain, fatigue, nausea, depression, anxiety, drowsiness, appetite, dyspnea, insomnia, and constipation among patients with metastatic cancer enrolled in an outpatient palliative care clinic.",

      "title": "NON-INTERVENTIONAL PALLIATIVE THERAPIES",
      "content": "Several non-interventional strategies can be used in terminally ill patients with pulmonary diseases. Dyspnea is the most commonly encountered symptom in lung cancer, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), ILDs, and so forth. Opioids are the backbone for the management of dyspnea without a reversible cause. 27,28 In Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), long-acting bronchodilators are effective even in patients nearing the end of their lives. 29 Investigators have also reported success with the use of nonpharmacologic therapies, such as upright positioning, cool-air fans, breathing/relaxation exercises, and reassurance. 30 Similarly, use of walking aids, neuroelectrical muscle stimulation, and chest wall vibration therapies have also been shown to improve dyspnea. 7 Robust evidence is lacking regarding the use of benzodiazepines in these situations, especially given their potential adverse effects. However, they can still be tried as second- or third-line agents. 31,32 Similarly, the use of noninvasive ventilation in terminally ill patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is controversial. 6\nCough is the second most commonly encountered symptom in patients receiving palliative care for pulmonary disorders. For cough productive of purulent sputum,antibiotics maybe used. Expectoration of mucus can be augmented by using mucolytic agents, such as nebulized hypertonic saline, bromhexine, n-acetyl cysteine, and guaifenesin. In patients with dry cough and those who are too feeble to cough, the goal is to suppress the cough with opioids and nebulized anesthetics such as lidocaine. 4 In patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), smoking cessation should be encouraged, in addition to humidified air and stopping protussive medications. 33 Palliation of hemoptysis may be attempted with antifibrinolytics, such as tranexamic acid. In severe cases, radiation therapy can be used.",

      "title": "Malignant Pleural Effusions",
      "content": "MPE is defined as the accumulation of a significant amount of exudate in the pleural space, accompanied by the presence of malignant cells or tumor tissue. 34 The most common route of spread of the tumor to the pleura is hematogenous, although it can also spread through direct extension or lymphatic route. 35 MPE accumulates as a result of increased fluid leakage from hyperpermeable blood vessels and impaired lymphatic drainage. 36 The major causes of MPEs are lung cancer in men and breast cancer in women. These two cancers account for 50% to 65% of all MPEs. 37 The disease burden of MPEs is enormous; 150,000 people develop MPEs in the United States each year. 38 MPE typically heralds advanced incurable cancer. The mean survival with MPE is 4 to 6 months. 39 Therefore, at this stage emphasis should be on palliation and symptom control rather than pursuing aggressive treatments.\nOn computed tomography (CT) scan, the presence of pleural thickening and nodularity along with the absence of air-bronchograms and septations should raise the suspicion for MPE. 40,41 PET-CT has an 81% sensitivity and 74% specificity for the detection of MPE; therefore, its routine use for diagnosing MPEs is not recommended. Ultrasound-guided thoracentesis is generally the first step toward confirming the diagnosis in suspected cases of MPE. It not only provides the fluid for cytologic examination but also provides useful information, such as the degree of symptom improvement with fluid removal, the rate of reaccumulation, and whether a trapped lung is present. The mean diagnostic yield of one cytologic examination is 60%. Therefore, thoracentesis may need to be performed 2 to 3 times to increase the sensitivity. 42 Thoracentesis is a safe procedure with rates of pneumothorax and chest tube insertion of 2.5% and 0.8%, respectively. 43 If the diagnosis cannot beestablished, a pleural biopsy mayhave to be pursued. 44 Medical thoracoscopy has a sensitivity of 91% and specificity of 100% for the diagnosis of MPE.\nEven though earlier definitive therapies minimize the risk of complications associated with MPEs, many MPEs will not recur after the first thoracentesis. Therefore, it is reasonable to wait and watch after the first drainage. If the MPE recurs, available\noptions include indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs), chest tubes with pleurodesis, and surgical pleurodesis. Among these options, IPCs are most commonly offered by the interventional pulmonologists and have the strongest literature backing them.\nWalker and colleagues 45 reported a prospective cohort study that compared 4 different modalities for the treatment of MPEs: IPC versus videoassisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and IPC versus chest tube and talc slurry versus VATS and talc poudrage. All options were equally effective in relieving patients' dyspnea and other symptoms; however, IPCs were associated with the least amount of discomfort and time in the hospital. The Second Therapeutic Intervention in Malignant Effusion Trial (TIME2) was an unblinded randomized controlled trial comparing IPC with chest tube and talc pleurodesis for MPE. IPC was associated with better symptom control at 6 months. IPC was also associated with shorter hospitalization and a decreased need for repeat procedures. 46 The Australasian Malignant Pleural Effusion (AMPLE) Trial was a multicenter trial comparing IPC with talc slurry pleurodesis for the management of MPE. A total of 144 patients were enrolled, and the total duration of follow-up was 1 year. The total hospitalization days were significantly lower in the IPC group compared with the pleurodesis group, with a mean reduction in hospitalization of 3.7 days per patient. No significant differences in mortality or adverse event rates were noted between the two groups. The investigators concluded that IPC use can save 555,000 hospital days over pleurodesis, without significantly affecting complication rates or mortality. 47\nWhile an IPC allows the patients to intermittently drain the pleural fluid at home, it also affords the possibility of achieving pleurodesis, at which time the IPC can be removed. Pleurodesis is reported in 45.6% cases. Trapped lung, a longer interval between MPE onset and insertion of the IPC, fluid glucose less than 60 mg/dL, pH less than 7.20, and lactate dehydrogenase greater than 700 IU/L decrease the chances of pleurodesis. 48,49 Multiple cost-effectiveness analyses have also shown IPCs to be more cost-effective than other modalities. 50,51\nThe potential complications of IPC include empyema, pneumothorax requiring chest tube insertion, and cellulitis, reported in 2.8%, 5.9%, and 3.4% cases, respectively. 52 In another trial, 4.9% patients developed IPC-related pleural space infections; 94%of these infections were controlled with antibiotics. Only 1 out of 1021 patients died of an IPCrelated infection. 53 Fourteen percent of patients with MPE and IPC will develop loculations.\nAlthough fibrinolytic drugs may be instilled to break up the loculations, there is no consensus for the management of these patients. 54 Catheter tract metastasis is another potential complication, typically presenting as nodules or masses at the catheter insertion site or along its tract. In one study, they were reported in 1.9% of the cases. 46 However, these show a good response to radiation therapy. 55 Mild pain following catheter insertion is common; severe pain necessitating catheter removal is only reported in 0.6% cases. 56",

      "title": "Airway Obstruction",
      "content": "About one-third of patients with lung cancer develop central airway obstruction. 57 The resulting dyspnea, hemoptysis, secretions, and recurrent pneumonia are a major cause of morbidity and reduced quality of life. Unfortunately, only onefifth of these patients' disease will be amenable to curative surgery, with the reset requiring some form of palliative intervention. 58 Airway obstruction can be caused by an endobronchial tumor or by external compression from esophageal cancer, lymphoma, metastasis, and so forth. No uniform guidelines exist for the management of airway obstruction, and the choice of intervention depends on the patient characteristics and local expertise.\nMechanical tumor debulking can be achieved with the beveled edge of the rigid bronchoscope. However, most of the times, mechanical debulking has to be coupled with stenting and additional ablative therapies to increase the efficacy and reduce the risk of bleeding. 59 These additional ablative therapies include electrocautery, laser, argon plasma coagulation (APC), and cryotherapy.\nSilicon stents are the most commonly used stents. They come in various sizes and shapes, with multiple brands available. The Studded Dumon stent (manufactured by Novatech, France) is the most widely inserted silicon stent. 60 The studs on their surface are designed to embed in the airway walls and resist migration. There is a component of barium in the silicon stents that makes them visible on radiographs. Silicon stents are relatively cheaper and can be easily repositioned. However, they can only be inserted with a rigid bronchoscope under general anesthesia and have high rates of migration. Selfexpandable metallic stents, on the other hand, can be inserted with a flexible bronchoscope and have a low risk of migration. Their main disadvantages are a higher cost and difficulty in removing or repositioning them. 61 The rate of granulation tissue formation is also higher on metallic stents. Hybrid stents were created with multiple materials. The idea is to incorporate the best of both worlds. Metallic struts\nin hybrid stents provide the strength to counter compression, whereas the silicon covering makes granulation tissue formation and tumor overgrowth less likely. 62,63 Their biggest drawback is their cost. Like metallic stents, they are also hard to reposition and retrieve. Furukawa and colleagues 64 reported their experience with 58 stents in 40 patients with lung cancer. Statistically significant improvements in the performance status and Hugh-Jones classification scores were noted. Sixteen patients experienced complications, including hemoptysis (8 patients), retention of secretions (3 patients), restenosis (2 patients), tracheoesophageal fistulas (2 patients), and migration (1 patient).\nAdditional ablative therapies can be used with either flexible or rigid bronchoscopes. Ablative therapies may or may not be used in conjunction with stent placement. Electrocautery uses electricity to generate heat, which leads to tissue ablation. 65 In terms of the laser, the thermal effect of the Nd:YAG laser is most commonly used in interventional pulmonology. 66 Boxem and colleagues 67 performed a retrospective comparative review of the Nd:YAG laser and electrocautery for symptomatic airway obstruction. Symptomatic improvement was noted in 70% of the cases, and the efficacy of the laser and electrocautery was similar; however, electrocautery was noted to be much cheaper. However, the laser has the fastest onset of action, making it the preferred modality in lifethreatening critical obstructions. 59 APC is a method of noncontact electrocoagulation that uses ionized argon gas. 68 Morice and colleagues 69 reported their experience with APC for airway obstruction and hemoptysis. In the group of patients with airway obstruction, an overall decrease in mean obstruction size to 18.4 /C6 22.1% was noted. All patients, except one, reported symptomatic improvement.",

Bronchoscopy can localize bleeding in 90% of the cases. 72 In these cases, tamponade can be achieved by tightly wedging the scope in the affected segment and instilling cold saline and vasoconstrictors. 73\nDespite the aforementioned interventions, many patients will continue to bleed; in these cases,\nadditional bronchoscopic interventions may be warranted. Valipour and colleagues 74 reported success in achieving topical hemostatic tamponade with oxidized regenerated cellulose (ORC) mesh. Hemostasis was achieved in 98% of the cases. Importantly, ORC mesh was absorbed in all patients without a foreign-body reaction. Morice and colleagues 69 reported their experience of APC in 31 patients with hemoptysis and 25 patients with both hemoptysis and obstruction. APC controlled bleeding in all patients. No procedural complications were noted. Similar success with the use of APC for hemoptysis was also reported by Crosta and colleagues. 68 The Nd:YAG laser has also been used for achieving hemostasis with a reported success rate of 60%. 75 If bronchoscopic interventions fail, patients should be referred for bronchial artery embolization, which typically falls in the realm of interventional radiology. 76",

They can develop as a surgical complication or in patients with lung cancer, emphysema, fibrosis, or infections. In these cases of advanced pulmonary diseases, BPFs can be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Traditionally the treatment of BPF includes prolonged chest tube drainage, pleurodesis, or surgical correction. 77 These treatments are cumbersome; in the case of surgical correction, some patients may be too frail to be good candidates.\nAlthough strong evidence is lacking, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of endobronchial valves for the treatment of BPFs as humanitarian use devices in 2008. 78 Firstly the segmental location of BPF is determined. Endobronchial valves are then placed using a flexible delivery catheter through a bronchoscope parked at the orifice of the affected segment. The valves have a one-way mechanism preventing air entry into the affected segment while allowing for the expulsion of air and mucus. Over time this causes atelectasis of the affected segment. Endobronchial valves are associated with minimal complications; however, their cost can be prohibitive. 79 If they are successful and a lasting resolution of the air leak has been achieved, the valves can be removed in 6 weeks. 80 Investigators have also studied endobronchial valves for endobronchial lung volume reduction in select cases of emphysema. However, this application is not recommended in the sickest patients and falls outside the realm of palliative care. 81 Endobronchial Watanabe Spigots are small silicone fillers, which have\nalso been studied for BPFs. However, their use has not caught on outside of Japan. 79",
