      "title": "Introduction",
      "content": "Approximately, 1.5 million new pleural effusions are diagnosed each year in the United States [1]. Thoracentesis with chemical, hematologic, and cytologic analysis of pleural fluid is the most common procedure performed for the diagnosis of pleural effusion not readily explained by clinical history [2]. In patients with cancer, pleural effusion may represent metastatic disease and making a diagnosis is paramount [3]. A definitive diagnosis of malignant pleural effusion (MPE) can be made by thoracentesis\nwith analysis of pleural fluid cytology or histologic analysis of pleural biopsies.\nThe  diagnostic  yield  for  malignancy  by  analysis  of pleural fluid cytology obtained on initial thoracentesis is 40-60%, and the yield increases only marginally for subsequent thoracenteses [4-6]. Sensitivity of pleural fluid cytology  obtained  on  initial  thoracentesis  is  60%  [5]. Pleural biopsy, either image-guided percutaneous or surgical, is recommended in cases where analysis of pleural fluid cytology is negative and clinical suspicion for MPE remains high [7]. Image-guided percutaneous pleural biopsy of focal pleural thickening and/or nodules has a reported sensitivity for malignancy of 70-94% and specificity approaching 100% [8-11]. Thoracoscopy with pleural biopsy under direct visualization is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of MPE, with reported sensitivity from 93 to 100% [12, 13].\nCurrently, thoracentesis is the recommended test for MPE due to all solid tumors. However, while thoracoscopy sensitivity is consistently high for all solid tumors, we hypothesized that the sensitivity of thoracentesis varies between types of solid tumors. This is clinically relevant, since if the marginal gain in sensitivity is significant, then  a  more  aggressive  strategy  of  early  thoracoscopy would be justified.\nDespite its modest sensitivity compared with thoracoscopic pleural biopsy, thoracentesis is considered the initial test of choice given its relative simplicity, safety, and cost. However, while thoracoscopy sensitivity is consistently high for all solid tumors [12], we hypothesized that the  sensitivity  of  thoracentesis  varies  between  types  of solid tumors. This is clinically relevant, since if the marginal gain in sensitivity is significant, then a more aggressive strategy of early thoracoscopy would be justified. If we could identify cases in which thoracentesis has particularly low sensitivity, direct referral for thoracoscopic biopsy would be a medically appropriate and cost effective alternative strategy. This has indeed proven to be the case for mesothelioma [14]. The sensitivity of thoracentesis  in  patients  with  mesothelioma  is  between  16  and 30.8%, since it is difficult to differentiate between reactive mesothelial cells secondary to inflammation and malignant cells [5, 15]. The diagnostic sensitivity of thoracentesis may also differ between lung cancer sub-types, with metastatic  adenocarcinoma having a greater sensitivity than squamous cell carcinoma [5, 7].\nThe aim of our study is to evaluate the sensitivity of initial thoracentesis with analysis of pleural fluid cytology stratified by tumor type in patients with an existing diagnosis of cancer and high clinical suspicion of MPE.",

      "content": "This retrospective cohort study used data of consecutive patients with pleural effusions who underwent an initial thoracentesis for suspected MPE from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2013 at our institution. Our Institutional Review Board (Committee 4 PA17-0384) approved this study.\nWe included all patients 18 years of age or older who had a known diagnosis  of  cancer  and  had  either  proven  metastatic  disease  or strong clinical evidence of metastatic disease. Strong clinical evidence of metastatic disease was defined as imaging demonstrating multiple metastases in a typical clinical pattern, such as a positron emission tomography (PET) or bone scan showing multiple bone metastases,  computed  tomography  scan  (CT)  or  magnetic  resonance image of the brain showing metastatic disease, and computed tomography scan of the chest/abdomen or pelvis with findings sufficiently definitive that the patient was deemed to have metastatic disease. In order to maximize the ability to detect a meaningful difference in the sensitivity of initial thoracentesis to diagnose MPE stratified by tumor type, we elected to enrich our cohort with patients who had either proven metastatic cancer or strong clinical evidence of metastatic disease and had a strong clinical suspicion for MPE.\nWe excluded patients lost to follow-up; patients without a chest x-ray, CT scan, or PET scan within 14 days from initial thoracentesis; patients with no history or suspicion of cancer; patients with loculated pleural effusions on chest x-ray as we would not quantify with precision the size of effusion in these patients; patients with a previous thoracentesis at an outside institution or history of chest tube placement; and patients with hematologic malignancy.\nPleural effusion size was based on the most recent chest x-ray done within 2 weeks of the first thoracentesis and was categorized as follows:\n- Blunting of costophrenic angle, but at least part of diaphragm is still visible.\n- Effusion greater than 1, and up to the inferior border of the vascular pedicle.\n- Effusion greater than 2, and up to the top of the cardiac silhouette.\n- Effusion greater than 3, and up to the top of the aortic arch.\n- Highest effusion greater than aortic arch.\nPleural fluid cytology was processed using both smears and cell block was performed. For details of this procession see online supplementary appendix S1 (for all online suppl. material, see www. karger.com/doi/10.1159/000490732).\nThe primary outcome was the sensitivity of initial thoracentesis by tumor type. For our analysis, all initial cytology results positive for malignancy were considered true positives.\nThe final designated etiology of pleural effusion in all patients was established by the treating physician and pulmonary research team based on review of all available clinical information and with follow-up for  at  least  6  months.  The  final  diagnostic  categories were as follows:",

      "content": "We  reviewed  the  medical  records  of  1,323  patients with cancer that was either proven to be metastatic or in whom strong clinical evidence of metastatic disease was present. We excluded 107 patients with congestive heart failure and 373 with high clinical suspicion of pneumonia. Of the remaining 843 patients, 725 had solid tumor malignancies and were included in our final analysis.\nOf our final cohort, 458 (63%) had an initial thoracentesis with pleural fluid cytology positive for malignancy. Diagnostic yield of pleural fluid cytology was greatest for pancreatic cancer (86 [95% CI 65-97]) and lowest for sarcoma (20 [95% CI 5-71]; Table 1). After final review of all available clinical information with follow-up for at least\n6 months, a final diagnosis of malignancy was established in 537 of 725 (74%) patients. The median time of followup  for  effusions  with  unknown  etiology  was  247  days (range from 15 to 915 days).\nPerformance characteristics of pleural fluid cytology were calculated for each tumor type (Table 2). The sensitivity of thoracentesis was lowest for head and neck malignancies (0.38 [95% CI 0.13-0.68]), sarcoma (0.38 [95% CI  0.15-0.65]),  and  renal  cancer  (0.53  [95%  CI  0.340.72]). The sensitivity for mesothelioma was 0; however, our cohort included only 5 cases.\nWe evaluated the risk factors of the entire cohort for final  diagnosis  of  MPE  as  final  diagnosis.  On  univariate analysis, the volume of pleural fluid drained ( p = 0.001), pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; p = 0.023), pleural protein level ( p < 0.0001), and pleural cholesterol level ( p = < 0.0001) significantly impacted the odds of having a final diagnosis of MPE. On multivariate analysis, amount of fluid drained and higher protein level remained as risk factors of having a final diagnosis of MPE (Table 3).\nIn addition, we evaluated risk factors of having a final diagnosis of MPE in those patients with a negative first cytology (Table 4).",

      "title": "Discussion",
      "content": "The diagnostic sensitivity of initial thoracentesis with pleural fluid cytology in patients with cancer and strong clinical suspicion of MPE depends on tumor type. Sensitivity is low for patients with sarcoma, head and neck malignancies, kidney cancer, and mesothelioma; and high in patients with breast and pancreatic cancer.\nOur findings are corroborated by a retrospective study by Bielsa et al. [5] who also reported different sensitivities of thoracentesis stratified by tumor type, with the highest sensitivity  for  adenocarcinoma  (66.5%).  However,  the sensitivity for adenocarcinomas of all organ types in our cohort was considerably greater than 66.5% [5]. An explanation for higher sensitivity may be the use of cell blocks\nAll positive cytologies were considered true positives.\nin addition to smears rather than only smears for pleural fluid cytological analysis. By current standards, cell blocks are essential for the comprehensive evaluation of pleural fluid cytology since they are made from concentrated cellular samples and may be used for immunocytochemistry and molecular testing [20, 21]. All pleural fluid cytology evaluations in our cohort included cell block analysis in addition to smears as compared with those by Bielsa et al.\n[5] that relied only on conventional smears. The superiority of using both smears and cell block was also proposed by Porcel et al. [22].\nIn our study, as in most studies that report on the sensitivity of thoracentesis for MPE, the use of all available clinical information and follow-up of at least 6 months was used as the reference standard of truth for determining what constituted a true negative result [6, 23-25]. We\nchose 6 months rather than a longer follow-up due to the nature of our patient population with already evidence of metastatic disease and low likelihood of survival beyond 6 months. The sensitivity of pleural fluid analysis in prior studies has ranged from 40 to 80% [8-20]. To our knowledge, only one study, published in abstract form, has systematically reported on the sensitivity of pleural fluid cytology using pleural biopsy on thoracoscopy as the reference standard [19]. They report a sensitivity of 0.70 (95% CI 0.59-0.80); however, information on previous thoracenteses and other relevant clinical parameters were not available, limiting the interpretation of these results.\nThe sensitivity of a test when applied to a population is the weighted average of the sensitivity of the test for the different strata. Therefore, it is important to present strataspecific estimates of the measures of disease accuracy for relevant subgroups [26, 27]. In the case of thoracentesis for MPE, if sarcoma or mesothelioma is very rare or non-existent in the population studied, then the weighted average will  be  higher  since  thoracentesis  has  low  sensitivity  for MPE in these diseases. For instance, in the study by Benamore et al. [9], the authors report very low sensitivity for cytological examination for malignancy but their prevalence of mesothelioma was high, while in the study by Salyer et al. [24] the sensitivity for cytological examination for malignancy was high but the prevalence of mesothelioma was low and that of adenocarcinoma was high. This likely explains the heterogeneity of results in prior studies.\nOur study suggests there are clinically meaningful differences in the sensitivity of thoracentesis between different types of tumors. Therefore, the utility of a diagnostic thoracentesis when malignancy is suspected may change depending on the underlying malignancy. For example, in a patient with sarcoma, where the sensitivity of thoracentesis is low for MPE, direct referral for pleural biopsy may be appropriate.\nSimilar to other studies we found that larger amount of fluid drained, higher pleural fluid protein and higher pleural fluid LDH were associated with a higher risk of MPE [28]. LDH is found in numerous clinical conditions and had been reported as a marker of poor outcome in cancer patients [29]. The proposed explanation for its rise in cancer is the favored use of glycolysis for energy, instead of oxidative phosphorylation by tumor cells, which is mediated by LDH [30]. However, this is not true from those patients in whom the first cytology was negative and final diagnosis was MPE. In this selected group of people with negative cytology, having contralateral pleural effusion was found to decrease the risk of having a final diagnosis of MPE.\nMost clinicians would be interested in knowing the sensitivity of thoracentesis in those patients with no evidence of metastatic disease; however, we made the decision  to  include  only  patients  with  already  evidence  of metastatic disease as these are the patients with a high pretest probability of MPE. This is however a limitation of our study as it includes the narrow generalizability of our results to other settings. We speculate that in a different population, where the pretest probability of MPE is low, the yield of pleural fluid cytology on initial thoracentesis stratified by tumor type is expected to be lower than what we have found in this study. Another limitation is that we relied on evaluation of all available clinical information and patient follow-up as the reference standard of truth for a true negative result rather than on pleural biopsy, particularly surgical biopsy as not all patients had a pleural biopsy. It is therefore possible that some effusions recorded as true negatives were actually false  negatives.  This  would  decrease  the  sensitivity  of thoracentesis further for those tumors with already low sensitivities. Another limitation was the uncertainty of the estimate as in some cases the CI are very wide and this is this is due to the low number of patient in each diagnostic group. The generalizability of our results may also be impacted by the resources, expertise, and specimen handling  methods  available  at  different  institutions  as our study population received care at a dedicated cancer center.\nIn conclusion, in patients with a high pre-test probability of MPE secondary to a solid tumor malignancy, the sensitivity of pleural fluid cytology on initial thoracentesis to diagnosis of MPE is significantly impacted by the underlying cancer type. Referring patients with MPE with tumors associated with very low thoracentesis sensitivity such as those with sarcoma, head and neck malignancies, kidney cancer, mesothelioma, and squamous cell carcinoma directly to a thoracoscopic or image-guided pleural biopsy may be considered in appropriate clinical settings. Future work such as cell-free DNA might improve our knowledge in this area of clinical practice and increase the sensitivity  of  the  diagnosis  in  patients  with  suspected MPE.",
