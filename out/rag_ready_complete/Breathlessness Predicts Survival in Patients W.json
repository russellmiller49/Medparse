MPEs are associated with poor survival, with a mean prognosis of approximately 6 months. However, signi /uniFB01 cant variation in survival exists. For example, a randomized trial comparing drainage methods demonstrated an interquartile range for survival of 2 to 11 months. 1 Choice of treatment depends on prognosis -in patients with a prognosis of less than 28 days, palliation of dyspnea with therapeutic aspiration alone may be most appropriate. 2 However, in patients with a better prognosis, intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) or chest drain and pleurodesis to give prolonged dyspnea relief and prevent the need for further pleural procedures is more appropriate. In some patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma with a very good prognosis, pleurectomy may be indicated. 3 Therefore, accurate determination of prognosis is important to guide treatment, as well as to inform patients.\nPrevious studies have identi /uniFB01 ed baseline variables associated with prognosis, such as serum albumin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and performance status. 4-6 Two prognostic scores, the LENT score and the PROMISE score, can be used to predict prognosis at baseline. 7,8 The disadvantages of these scores is that they require invasive pleural /uniFB02 uid and blood sampling and\nmay be misleading in some subgroups of patients and at an individual level. 9-11\nIn other chronic respiratory and cardiac diseases associated with poor survival and breathlessness, increased breathlessness has been shown to be predictive of poor survival. In patients with idiopathic pulmonary /uniFB01 brosis, breathless assessed using the Medical Research Council chronic dyspnea score is associated with poor survival. 12,13 In patients presenting with acute congestive cardiac failure, subacute dyspnea is predictive of poor 1year mortality. 14 Cancer patients presenting to the ED with breathlessness have a mean survival of only 12 weeks. 15 The BODE index, a validated prognostic score for patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), includes dyspnea as well as BMI, air /uniFB02 ow obstruction, and exercise. 16 A previous systematic review has demonstrated that breathlessness is a predictor of mortality in the general population. 17 These data demonstrate that in a wide range of conditions and in the healthy population, breathlessness is associated with poor survival.\nThe visual analog scale for dyspnea (VASD) is a validated measure of breathlessness for patients with MPE. 18 This is a 100-mm line anchored at one end with ' no breathlessness ' and at the other with ' maximum possible breathlessness. ' Patients are asked to mark across the line to represent their level of breathlessness. This is scored by measuring from ' no breathlessness ' to the patient ' s mark. A higher score represents more severe breathlessness. The minimal important difference is 19 mm. 19 The VASD has been used as a primary or secondary outcome measure in several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) studying the effects of different interventions in patients with MPE. 1,20-23\nThe aim of this study was to investigate whether breathlessness measured using VASD predicts mortality in patients with MPE, using individual patient data collected as part of /uniFB01 ve RCTs.",

All studies recruited adults (18 years or older) with MPE, based on either histological or cytological con /uniFB01 rmation or recurrent exudative pleural effusion with con /uniFB01 rmed cancer elsewhere. All patients gave written informed consent at the time of enrollment into these studies for the use of data collected in the trial for further analysis. All studies measured breathlessness using VASD diaries, in which patients recorded baseline VASD (before trial intervention) and subsequently for a varying time (Table 1). Analysis was done on\nbaseline VASD, mean VASD over the /uniFB01 rst 7 days postintervention (7-day VASD), and mean of all post intervention VASD (total VASD). For IPC-plus, the intervention used was IPC insertion, not pleurodesis. Survival was measured in days from randomization until death. Tumor type was categorized as mesothelioma, lung, breast/ gynecological, or other. Size of effusion was measured as a percentage of the hemithorax, either measured using a validated electronic method or as a visual estimate. 24 Follow-up was until death or the end of the trial (Table 1).

      "content": "Our results demonstrate a signi /uniFB01 cant negative correlation between breathlessness assessed by VASD and survival in patients with MPEs. This is true at baseline, mean VASD over 7 days, and mean total VASD. This relationship is independent of other factors known to predict survival. These data demonstrate that breathless patients with MPE have a worse survival compared with those who are not breathless. This metaanalysis used patients from /uniFB01 ve different RCTs.\nThe breathlessness experienced by patients with MPE is multifactorial, not caused by the MPE alone. This will\nCRP ¼ C-reactive protein; ECOG ¼ Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group; IPC ¼ indwelling pleural catheter; IQR ¼ interquartile range; LDH ¼ lactate dehydrogenase; PF ¼ pleural /uniFB02 uid; PS ¼ performance status.\n]\ninclude pleural factors (such as trapped lung caused by extensive tumor involvement), involvement in the lung by cancer (eg, metastases, lymphangitis carcinomatosis, pulmonary embolism) and other common comorbidities (eg, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive cardiac failure). Breathlessness also leads to a downward cycle of decreased activity, deconditioning, and worsening breathlessness. 25 We hypothesize that breathlessness is a strong predictor of mortality because these underlying factors cause both breathlessness and poor survival.\nPrevious studies have identi /uniFB01 ed independent baseline variables that predict prognosis in patients with MPE and used these to develop prognostic scores (LENT and PROMISE). 7,8 Most of the variables identi /uniFB01 ed are related to systemic and in /uniFB02 ammatory factors (serum lymphocyte: neutrophil ratio, performance status, tumor type, previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy, hemoglobin, serum white cell count, serum CRP) rather than those speci /uniFB01 c to the effusion (pleural /uniFB02 uid LDH alone). This suggests that it is the\nCRP ¼ C-reactive protein; ECOG ¼ Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group; IPC ¼ indwelling pleural catheter; LDH ¼ lactate dehydrogenase; MPE ¼ malignant pleural effusion; PF ¼ pleural /uniFB02 uid; PS ¼ performance status; VASD ¼ visual analog scale for dyspnea.\npatient ' s overall condition that predicts mortality rather than the characteristics of the pleural effusion. The strength of using breathlessness as a predictor of survival is that it is a representation of the patient ' s overall condition.\nA surprising /uniFB01 nding of our study was that larger effusions were associated with improved survival. Data on effusion size were available in three studies (TIME3 and AMPLE-1 and -2). This is in contrast to other studies that have found that larger effusions were associated with worse survival. 26,27 This may be because these data come from different cohorts of patients: the studies by Jimenez et al 27 and Martinez-Moragon et al 26 were at presentation, whereas the patients in TIME3 were hospitalized patients with a nondraining effusion, and AMPLE-1 and -2 were patients with recurrent MPE undergoing a de /uniFB01 nitive procedure. Further research is required to explore this relationship.\nThese results are in keeping with other studies that have demonstrated a correlation between breathlessness and survival across a wide range of other diseases, as well as the healthy population. 12-15 A variety of different ways of measuring breathlessness have been used in these studies, but despite this, results are consistent across studies. This demonstrates that it is the symptom of breathlessness that is signi /uniFB01 cant, not the speci /uniFB01 c tool used to assess it. This commonality demonstrates that breathlessness may be a universal predictor of mortality and should be considered when attempting to predict mortality in speci /uniFB01 c populations.\nBreathlessness is associated with survival at a population level in patients with MPE, as well as a wide range of\nother conditions. However, this association does not appear to be strong enough to predict prognosis in individual patients. It may be more appropriate to use it as part of a clinical score, such as the BODE score for Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 16 Breathlessness should be assessed in future tools that attempt to predict mortality in patients with MPE.\nInclusion criteria for TIME2, AMPLE-1, and AMPLE-2 were similar, explaining the similar mortality. Mortality was better in IPC-plus, which excluded patients with nonexpansile lung, a group with worse mortality. 28 The signi /uniFB01 cantly worse mortality in patients recruited to TIME3 demonstrates that inpatients with MPE, a chest drain, and a septated pleural effusion have poor survival.\nThere are limitations of this study, mainly because the data were collected as part of /uniFB01 ve separate RCTs, rather than speci /uniFB01 cally to answer this question. First, not all baseline variables were recorded in the different trials, so they could not be included in the statistical analysis. Second, these trials had speci /uniFB01 c inclusion/exclusion criteria, and these results may not necessarily apply to the wider population of patients with MPE. Speci /uniFB01 cally, most patients had not had a previous de /uniFB01 nitive pleural procedure, and most trials speci /uniFB01 ed a minimum predicted survival (Table 1). Further research is needed into the relationship between breathlessness and survival in patients with MPE who do not ful /uniFB01 ll these trial criteria. In addition, the length of time patients completed a VASD diary for varied between the studies, but this did not seem to impact results. Finally, the trial interventions could potentially confound this result by in /uniFB02 uencing both breathlessness and survival. The results of these studies showed no difference in mortality between groups, but were not powered to assess a survival difference.\nOther limitations are attributable to the way the VASD was used to measure breathlessness. The VASD was not standardized between the studies. In TIME2 and TIME3, it was as described in the introduction, whereas in AMPLE-1 and 2, the 100-mm point was marked ' worst imaginable breathlessness. ' Furthermore, the VASD was the opposite way around in AMPLE-1 compared with the other studies, with ' no breathlessness ' at the righthand end. For IPC-plus, patients were asked, ' How much breathlessness are you feeling at the moment? ' and the 100-mm point was marked ' worst possible breathlessness. ' A standardized script was not used to explain the VASD to patients. Language also may have been a limitation for some patients, with all studies\n]\nproviding the VASD diary in English only. Future work should use a standardized VASD, and further research may be required to determine the best way to measure breathlessness to predict mortality.",
