Boiselle, MD b, *\nTracheobronchomalacia (TBM) is a disorder that results from a weakness of the tracheobronchial walls and/or supporting cartilage, resulting in excessive expiratory collapse ( Fig. 1 ). 1-5 This condition may arise congenitally from disorders related to underlying impaired cartilage maturation or may be acquired from conditions related to prior intubation, infection, trauma, long-standing extrinsic central airway compression, or chronic inflammation. 1-5\nAlthough TBM has been increasingly recognized as an important cause of chronic respiratory symptoms, it is still considered a relatively underdiagnosed condition. 3 Because it escapes detection on routine end-inspiratory chest radiographs and CT scans, the diagnosis of TBM usually requires evaluating the airway during an active respiratory maneuver such as dynamic exhalation or coughing. 3,4,6 Recent advances in CT technology now allow the radiologist to accurately diagnose this condition noninvasively with similar accuracy to bronchoscopy, the historical reference standard. 6,7\nThis article provides an up-to-date review of imaging for TBM, including clinical indications, physiologic principles, diagnostic criterion, multidetector CT (MDCT) protocols, multiplanar and\n3-dimensional images, image interpretation, and pre- and postoperative assessment. An emphasis is placed on providing the reader with practical information that will enhance the ability to optimally perform and interpret CT studies for diagnosing TBM in daily clinical practice.",

      "content": "Functional CT imaging for TBM requires acquiring imaging data either during or after a provocative maneuver such as expiration and coughing. In order to understand why certain respiratory maneuvers are more effective than others at eliciting tracheal collapse, it is important to review the relationship of tracheal collapse to intrathoracic pressures. Changes in size of malacic trachea and bronchi depend on the difference between the intraluminal pressure inside the airways and the pleural (intrathoracic) pressure outside. 4,10 Pleural pressure depends mostly on respiratory muscles, and is high during expiratory efforts. In contrast, intraluminal pressures are highly variable, and depend on airflow. When airflow is\nzero, intraluminal pressure equals alveolar pressure and differs from pleural pressure only by the elastic recoil pressure of the lung, which depends on lung volume. At maximal lung volume with no flow (end-inspiration), the intraluminal pressure is 20 to 30 cm H2O greater than pleural pressure, and the pressure difference expands the trachea.",

The trachea is most compressed during cough and dynamic expiration at low lung volume, when pleural pressure is high ( w 100 cm H2O), and expiratory flow limitation in the small airways prevents transmission of the high alveolar pressures to the central airways. Under these conditions, intraluminal pressure is nearly atmospheric, and the large transmural pressure causes tracheal collapse. 4,10\nThus, based on physiologic principles, imaging during a forced exhalation or coughing maneuver is more sensitive for eliciting TBM than imaging at end-expiration.",

      "content": "Although greater than 50% expiratory reduction in cross-sectional area of the airway lumen is widely considered diagnostic of TM, it is important to be aware that asymptomatic, healthy individuals may demonstrate levels of expiratory collapse that exceed this diagnostic threshold ( Fig. 3 ). For example, Stern and colleagues 11 obtained a degree of tracheal collapse greater than 50% at end-expiration in 4 of 10 healthy young adult male volunteers scanned with an electron-beam CT. Based on their findings, these authors recommended a more conservative threshold of 70% of collapse as indicative of TM. Similarly, Heussel and colleagues 12 reported that healthy volunteers can sometimes exceed the standard diagnostic criterion. Moreover, when using 64-MDCT ''cine'' imaging to assess the trachea during coughing, it has been suggested that a higher threshold value of 70% should be considered when using this\nrobust provocative maneuver to elicit tracheal collapse. 13\nBased on the results of these studies, there is a need to obtain normative data regarding the range of tracheal collapse using forced exhalation among patients of varying ages, ethnicities, and both genders, both with and without coexistent pulmonary disease. Until such data are published, one should keep in mind that there is substantial overlap with normal physiologic changes at the lower range of positive results. Thus, MDCT results should be carefully correlated with respiratory symptoms and functional impairment.",

This protocol can be successfully performed with any type of MDCT scanner. However, the best results are produced with scanner configurations of eight or more detector rows.\nAt the authors' institutions, this technique is the method of choice for imaging adults and children older than 5 years for suspected malacia. In the following paragraphs, scanning parameters for imaging adults are reviewed. For detailed information about imaging children with this protocol, the reader is referred to Lee and colleagues. 8,9\nBefore helical scanning, initial scout topographic images are obtained to determine the area of coverage, which extends from the proximal trachea through the main bronchi, corresponding to a length of approximately 10 to 12 cm in adults. If the patient has not had a recent CT scan, the end-inspiratory acquisition can be extended to\ninclude the entire lungs to assess for potential complications of malacia such as bronchiectasis. Helical scanning is performed in the craniocaudal direction for both end-inspiratory and dynamicexpiratory scans.\nThe end-inspiratory scan is performed first (170 mAs, 120 kVp, 2.5 mm collimation, pitch equivalent of 1.5). Following the end-inspiratory scan, patients are subsequently coached with instructions for the dynamic expiratory component of the scan (40 mAs, 120 kVp, 2.5 mm collimation, high-speed mode, with pitch equivalent of 1.5). For this sequence, patients are instructed to take a deep breath in and to blow it out during the CT acquisition, which is coordinated to begin with the onset of the patient's forced expiratory effort. Detailed ''scripts'' of breathing instructions for this protocol can be found in an article by Bankier and colleagues. 14",

At the authors' institution this protocol is performed with detector collimation 0.5 mm /C2 64; mA 5 80; kVp 5 120; gantry rotation 5 0.4 seconds.\nAn initial scout topographic image is obtained to determine the area of coverage, which extends 3.2 to 4.0 cm in craniocaudad length depending on the scan manufacturer. In order to ''sample'' the\ntrachea and proximal main bronchi within a single acquisition, the inferior aspect of the acquisition is set at the level of the carina, and the superior aspect of the acquisition is set 3.2 cm above this level, which corresponds to approximately the level of the aortic arch in most adults. A 3- to 5-second acquisition is acquired in cine mode beginning at end-inspiration and followed by repeated coughing maneuvers. Images are reconstructed at 8-mm collimation in a standard algorithm, creating four contiguous cine datasets from a single acquisition.\nThe recently introduced dynamic-volume 320 MDCT scanner (Aquilion ONE, Toshiba Medical Systems) provides 16 cm of anatomic coverage in a single rotation. 15 This technique holds great promise for evaluating TBM because it provides coverage of the entire intrathoracic trachea in most older children and adults.",

      "content": "Because paired inspiratory-expiratory CT requires imaging during two phases of respiration, it has the potential to result in a ''double dose'' compared with a traditional single-phase CT scan unless methods for dose reduction are used. Cine imaging also has the potential for high radiation exposure.\nBecause of the high inherent contrast between the air-filled trachea and soft tissue structures, it is possible to substantially reduce dose without negatively influencing image quality for assessing luminal dimensions of the airway. 4,6 For example, a clinical study by Zhang and colleagues 16 showed no difference between standard (240 to 260 mA) and low-dose (40 to 80 mA) images for assessing the tracheal lumen during dynamic expiration.\nThus, a low-dose (30 to 40 mAs) technique should be used when imaging during coughing or expiration. Although a standard mAs level is typically used for the end-inspiratory scan, dose modulation can be used to modify the mAs level during the acquisition to further reduce radiation exposure.\nThe estimated radiation dose (expressed as dose-length product) for a dual-phase study (standard-dose end-inspiratory sequence 1 low-dose dynamic expiratory sequence) for a 70-kg patient is approximately 500 mGy.cm, which is comparable to a routine chest CT (reference value 600 mGy.cm). 17 By comparison, the estimated dose for a low-dose cine CT is approximately 200 to 220 mGy.cm. However, unlike the dual-phase scan, which covers the entirety of the central airways, a single cine acquisition covers only 3.2 to 4.0 cm in the z-axis (depending on the scanner\nconfiguration). If repeated at multiple levels to provide similar coverage to the dual phase CT, the total dose for serial cine acquisitions would be greater than the dual-phase technique. Estimated doses for cine imaging of the airways using the new 320 MDCT scanner are not currently available, but careful attention to dose reduction methods will be important with this scanner to avoid excessive radiation exposure.",

      "title": "IMAGE INTERPRETATION",
      "content": "Interpretation of CT images requires careful rev iew and comparison of both end-inspiratory and dynamic-expiratory images.\nEnd-inspiratory images provide important anatomic information about tracheal size, shape, and wall thickness, as well as the presence or absence of extrinsic masses compressing the\ntrachea. In patients with TM, the tracheal lumen is almost always normal in appearance on end-inspiration CT. 2 There are four notable exceptions. First, patients with relapsing polychondritis ( Fig. 5 ) frequently demonstrate characteristic wall thickening and calcification that spares the posterior membranous wall of the trachea. Second, patients with lunate (coronal > sagittal dimension) tracheal configurations ( Fig. 6 ). Third, patients with tracheomegaly (coronal diameter > 25 mm). Fourth, patients with extrinsic tracheal compression from adjacent vascular anomalies or thyroid masses (see Fig. 2 ).\nWhen there is near or complete collapse of the airway lumen during expiration, the diagnosis of malacia can be confidently made based on visual analysis of the images (see Fig. 1 ). However, the most accurate means for diagnosing malacia on CT in patients with subtotal expiratory collapse is to use an electronic tracing tool to calculate the cross-sectional area of the airway lumen on images at the same anatomic level obtained at inspiration and dynamic expiration ( Fig. 7 ). 4 Such tools can be found on commercially available picture archiving and communication systems stations as well as with 3D workstations.\nAsdescribed in the previous section, greater than 50% expiratory reduction in cross-sectional area is considered diagnostic. Care should be taken to\nensure that the same anatomic level is compared between the two sequences by comparing vascular structures and other anatomic landmarks.\nAlthough quantitative methods are preferable to visual assessment, it is important to be aware that about half of patients with acquired TM will demonstrate an expiratory ''frown-like'' configuration, in which the posterior membranous wall is excessively bowed forward and parallels the convex contour of the anterior wall with less than 6-mm distance between the anterior and posterior walls ( Fig. 8 ). 22 This appearance, which has been coined the ''frown sign,'' has the potential to aid the detection of TM when patients inadvertently breathe during routine CT scans. 22\nWith regard to interpreting cine coughing CT studies, these exams are ideally viewed in ''cine'' fashion at either a picture archiving and communication systems workstation or 3D workstation. Quantitative measurements are obtained on individual static images in a similar fashion to the technique described for paired-inspiratorydynamic-expiratoryCT.Asdescribedearlier,greater than 70% reduction in cross-sectional area during coughing is considered diagnostic. A commercial software program (Analyze 6.0, AnalyzeDirect, Inc., Lenexa KS) can also be used to provide automated measurement of changes in tracheal lumen crosssectional area values during the cine sequence. 13\nWhen interpreting functional CT scans of patients with TM, it is important to report the severity, distribution, and morphology. These factors have an important impact on treatment decisions, which are based on a combination of\nsymptoms, severity and distribution of disease, and underlying cause of TM. 23\nBecause there is not a single widely accepted scale for reporting the severity of TM, it is important to report the quantitative degree of\ncollapsibility rather than simply using a qualitative descriptor. A severity scale that has been used by some investigators includes three grades of severity based on the degree of airway collapse: (1) mild: 50% to 74%; (2) moderate: 74% to 99%; and (3) severe: 100% collapse. 7,23 In contrast, we consider more than 90% expiratory collapse as indicative of severe TM.\nMurgu and Colt 23 recently proposed a functional class/extent/morphology/origin/severity (FEMOS) classification for TM. In this classification, a focal distribution of malacia is defined as involvement of one tracheal region (upper, middle, or lower) or involvement of one main or lobar bronchus. Multifocal distribution is defined as involvement of two contiguous or at least two noncontiguous regions, and diffuse involvement is defined as involvement of more than two contiguous regions. From a practical perspective, accurate determination of distribution has implications for treatment. For example, focal areas of malacia may benefit from stenting, whereas diffuse disease is more amenable to tracheoplasty surgery.\nRegarding morphology, one should describe whether the collapse occurs circumferentially, or\nif it occurs primarily because of either excessive bulging of the posterior membranous wall or collapse of the anterolateral cartilaginous structures. For example, patients with collapse primarily because of bulging and flaccidity of the posterior membranous wall are potential candidates for tracheoplasty surgery, a novel surgical technique in which in the posterior wall of the trachea is reinforced by a Marlex graft. 24 Surgical reinforcement of the posterior membranous wall enhances the rigidity of this structure and makes it less susceptible to bowing during expiration.",

In the postoperative setting, CT provides a noninvasive method for assessing for postoperative complications and noninvasively\nquantifying the degree of improvement in airway collapsibility.\nOur surgeons and pulmonologists have found a combination of subjective symptomatic improvement and quantitative reduction in airway collapsibility at CT to be the most helpful measurements of determining response to surgery. 24 Our preliminary findings comparing preoperative and postoperative scans showed that tracheoplasty resulted in a decrease in the degree of airway collapse that was accompanied by a qualitative improvement of respiratory symptoms. 24",

Paired end-inspiratory, dynamic expiratory MDCT is the examination of choice for assessing patients with suspected TBM. Radiologists should become familiar with imaging protocols and interpretation techniques to accurately diagnose this condition using MDCT.",
