    "abstract": "CONTEXT: Malignant pleural effusion causes disabling dyspnea in patients with a short life expectancy. Palliation is achieved by fluid drainage, but the most effective first-line method has not been determined. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) are more effective than chest tube and talc slurry pleurodesis (talc) at relieving dyspnea. DESIGN: Unblinded randomized controlled trial (Second Therapeutic Intervention in Malignant Effusion Trial [TIME2]) comparing IPC and talc (1:1) for which 106 patients with malignant pleural effusion who had not previously undergone pleurodesis were recruited from 143 patients who were treated at 7 UK hospitals. Patients were screened from April 2007-February 2011 and were followed up for a year. INTERVENTION: Indwelling pleural catheters were inserted on an outpatient basis, followed by initial large volume drainage, education, and subsequent home drainage. The talc group were admitted for chest tube insertion and talc for slurry pleurodesis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Patients completed daily 100-mm line visual analog scale (VAS) of dyspnea over 42 days after undergoing the intervention (0 mm represents no dyspnea and 100 mm represents maximum dyspnea; 10 mm represents minimum clinically significant difference). Mean difference was analyzed using a mixed-effects linear regression model adjusted for minimization variables. RESULTS: Dyspnea improved in both groups, with no significant difference in the first 42 days with a mean VAS dyspnea score of 24.7 in the IPC group (95% CI, 19.3-30.1 mm) and 24.4 mm (95% CI, 19.4-29.4 mm) in the talc group, with a difference of 0.16 mm (95% CI, −6.82 to 7.15; P = .96). There was a statistically significant improvement in dyspnea in the IPC group at 6 months, with a mean difference in VAS score between the IPC group and the talc group of −14.0 mm (95% CI, −25.2 to −2.8 mm; P = .01). Length of initial hospitalization was significantly shorter in the IPC group with a median of 0 days (interquartile range [IQR], 0-1 day) and 4 days (IQR, 2-6 days) for the talc group, with a difference of −3.5 days (95% CI, −4.8 to −1.5 days; P < .001). There was no significant difference in quality of life. Twelve patients (22%) in the talc group required further pleural procedures compared with 3 (6%) in the IPC group (odds ratio [OR], 0.21; 95% CI, 0.04-0.86; P = .03). Twenty-one of the 52 patients in the catheter group experienced adverse events vs 7 of 54 in the talc group (OR, 4.70; 95% CI, 1.75-12.60; P = .002). CONCLUSION: Among patients with malignant pleural effusion and no previous pleurodesis, there was no significant difference between IPCs and talc pleurodesis at relieving patient-reported dyspnea.

This approach was used to account for days with missing VAS scores (the analysis did not differentiate between scores missing due to patient death and those missing because the patient did not complete their VAS score on that day). Study day was modeled as a continuous variable using fractional polynomials and was included in the model as a random effect. The model adjusted for the baseline VAS score and mean imputation was used for patients from whom a baseline score was unavailable. 20 A number of sensitivity analyses were performed using multiple imputation under a variety of missing-at-random and missing-notat-random scenarios.\nFull details of all statistical analyses can be found in the statistical analysis plan (eSupplement available at http: //www.jama.com).",

The mean IPC drainage frequency in the first 42 days was twice weekly. Twenty-nine of 51 patients (57%) had their IPCs removed; however 3 patients (6%) subsequently required further pleural intervention (1 therapeutic aspiration, 2 chest tube insertions), giving an overall spontaneous pleurodesis rate of 51%.\nIn the talc group, 6 patients had not undergonepleurodesis, 3 due to trapped lung and 3 due to chest tube displacement. Twelve talc patients (22%) had further pleural procedures compared with 3 (6%) in the IPC group (Odds ratio (OR), 0.21; 95% CI, 0.04-0.86; P =.03).",

      "content": "To our knowledge, this is the first randomized trial to directly compare IPCs with chest tube and talc slurry pleurodesis for initial treatment of symptomatic malignant pleural effusion and to assess the key outcome of dyspnea. Our results demonstrate that both strategies are highly effective treatments for relieving dyspnea with more than 75% achieving a clinically significant improvement and demonstrated that there was no significant difference in the clinically important outcome measures of chest pain and quality of life between these treatments. As such, IPCs cannot be advocated as a superior treatment to talc pleurodesis for palliation of symptoms. However, other factors such as length of hospital stay, adverse events, and the inconvenience of on-going drainage may be important factors in patient and physician choice of initial treatment modality in malignant pleural effusion, and this study provides initial data on which to base some of these choices.\nCurrent guidelines 1 advocate talc slurry pleurodesis as first-line therapy for malignant pleural effusion, with IPCs reserved for second-line treatment or for those without complete\nlung reexpansion. The results of this study suggest that both talc pleurodesis and indwelling catheters are effective initial treatments for symptom relief in malignant pleural effusion. Alternative first-line treatments include surgical pleurodesis with decortication or medical thoracoscopy and talc poudrage. A previous study has shown no significant difference in pleurodesis failure rate between talc poudrage and talc slurry. However, the relative dyspnea relief associated with these treatments has not been assessed 7 and this should be the subject of further study.\nThe secondary outcomes in this study suggest that there may be advantages to the use of IPCs. These include a significantly shorter initial and total duration of hospital stay for drainage and drain related complications, congruent with published nonrandomized series, 22 a clinically significant improvement in dyspnea in the IPC group at 6 months, and a 16% absolute reduction in the proportion of patients requiring further pleural interventions over 12 months. These secondary results are encouraging but should be interpreted with caution because this study was not powered to definitively address these outcomes.\nThepotential advantages of IPCs are, however, associated with an increase in observed adverse events (OR, 4.7) compared with talc pleurodesis, including 5 patients (9.6%) with pleural infection, meeting regulatory criteria for seriousness, compared with 1 (1.9%) in the talc group. The 2 nonserious pleural infections reported may have represented catheter colonization rather than infection because both patients were asymptomatic.\nOverall cost of these treatments will be an important factor in determining which treatments are offered in the future. Previous studies comparing talc with IPC treatment have suggested reducedinitial costs for IPC treatment but potential increased community care costs. 23,24 Cost analysis was not the primary purpose of this study; however, cost economic analysis of our data, in-\ncluding assessment of both inhospital and primary care use, is currently in progress.\nThere are several limitations to this study. The nature of the interventions under investigation meant that blinding was not possible, and the primary outcome measure was subjective (dyspnea VAS). Although these factors may have permitted bias in selfreported dyspnea measurement, the treatment intent in malignant pleural effusion drainage is palliative; a subjective, patient-reported measure is therefore a necessary and relevant outcome in a trial assessing such treatments. This trial demonstrates that both talc pleurodesis and IPCs are effective treatments for relieving dyspnea and improving patients' quality of life but that indwelling catheters are not superior to talc pleurodesis for these outcomes. Although there may be other advantages to the use of IPCs-reduced hospital stay and decreased requirement for further pleural proceduresthese potential benefits have not been definitively proven and require further investigation. The results from this study provide evidence on which discussion of relative risks and benefits of each treatment can be basedtreatment choice is likely to depend on individual patients' attitude toward hospital stay, home drainage, and relative adverse effects.",
