The shortest survival time is observed in malignant effusions secondary to lung cancer and the longest in ovarian cancer, while malignant effusions due to an unknown primary have an intermediate survival time. 2 e 6 Historically, studies showed that median survival times in effusions due to carcinoma of the breast are 5 e 6 months. However, more recent studies have suggested longer survival times of up to 15 months. 7 e 10 A comparison of survival times in breast cancer effusions in published studies to 1994 calculated a median survival of 11 months. 9\nCurrently, lung cancer is the most common metastatic tumour to the pleura in men and breast cancer in women. 4 11 Together, both malignancies account for 50 e 65% of all malignant effusions (table 1). Lymphomas, tumours of the genitourinary tract and gastrointestinal tract account for a further 25%. 2 12 e 14 Pleural effusions from an unknown primary are responsible for 7 e 15% of all malignant pleural effusions. 3 13 14 Few studies have estimated the proportion of pleural effusions due to mesothelioma: studies from 1975, 1985 and 1987 identi /uniFB01 ed mesothelioma in 1/271, 3/472 and 22/592 patients, respectively, but there are no more recent data to update this in light of the increasing incidence of mesothelioma. 4 13 14\nAttempts have been made to predict survival based on the clinical characteristics of pleural /uniFB02 uid. None has shown a de /uniFB01 nite correlation: a recent systematic review of studies including 433 patients assessing the predictive value of pH concluded that low pH does not reliably predict a survival of < 3 months. 15 16 In malignant mesothelioma, one study has shown an association between increasing pH and increasing survival. 17 Burrows et al showed that only performance status was signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with mortality: median survival was 1.1 months with a Karnofsky score < 30 and 13.2 months with a score > 70. 18\nAn algorithm for the management of malignant pleural effusions is shown in /uniFB01 gure 1.",

Although small cell lung cancer, lymphoma and breast cancer usually respond to chemotherapy, associated secondary pleural effusions may require intervention during the course of treatment ( /uniFB01 gure 1). Malignant pleural effusions are often most effectively managed by complete drainage of the effusion and instillation of a sclerosant to promote pleurodesis and prevent recurrence of the effusion. Options for management include observation, therapeutic pleural aspiration, intercostal tube drainage and instillation of sclerosant, thoracoscopy and pleurodesis or placement of an indwelling pleural catheter.",

(B)\n< Suction to aid pleural drainage before and after pleurodesis is usually unnecessary but, if applied, a high-volume low-pressure system is recommended. (C)\nLarge pleural effusions should be drained incrementally, draining a maximum of 1.5 l on the /uniFB01 rst occasion. Any remaining /uniFB02 uid should be drained 1.5 l at a time at 2 h intervals, stopping if the patient develops chest discomfort, persistent cough or vasovagal symptoms. Re-expansion pulmonary oedema is a well-described serious but rare complication following rapid expansion of a collapsed lung through evacuation of large amounts of pleural /uniFB02 uid on a single occasion and the use of early and excessive pleural suction. 50 51 Putative pathophysiological mechanisms include reperfusion injury of the underlying hypoxic lung, increased capillary permeability and local production of neutrophil chemotactic factors such as interleukin-8. 52 53\nThe most important requirement for successful pleurodesis is satisfactory apposition of the parietal and visceral pleura, con /uniFB01 rmed radiologically. 44 54 55 Incomplete lung re-expansion may be due to a thick visceral peel ( ' trapped lung ' ), pleural loculations, proximal large airway obstruction or a persistent air leak. Most studies indicate that the lack of a response following instillation of a sclerosant is associated with incomplete lung expansion. 56 Where complete lung re-expansion or pleural apposition is not achieved, pleurodesis may still be attempted or an indwelling pleural catheter may be inserted. Robinson and colleagues reported a favourable response in 9 out of 10 patients with partial re-expansion of the lung in a study using doxy-\ncycline as a sclerosing agent. 57 The amount of trapped lung compatible with successful pleurodesis is unknown. Complete lack of pleural apposition will prevent pleurodesis: consideration of an indwelling pleural catheter is recommended in this situation. Where more than half the visceral pleura and parietal pleura are apposed, pleurodesis may be attempted although there are no studies to support this recommendation.\nThe amount of pleural /uniFB02 uid drained per day before the instillation of a sclerosant ( < 150 ml/day) is less relevant for successful pleurodesis than radiographic con /uniFB01 rmation of /uniFB02 uid evacuation and lung re-expansion. In a randomised study, a shorter period of intercostal tube drainage and hospital stay was seen in the group in whom sclerotherapy was undertaken as soon as complete lung re-expansion was documented (majority < 24 h) than in the group in whom pleurodesis was attempted only when the /uniFB02 uid drainage was < 150 ml/day. The success rate in both groups approached 80%. 55 After sclerosant instillation, the duration of intercostal drainage appears not to affect the chances of successful pleurodesis, although the only randomised study to address this question was underpowered. 58\nSuction may rarely be required for incomplete lung expansion and a persistent air leak. When suction is applied, the use of high-volume low-pressure systems is recommended with a gradual increment in pressure to about e 20 cm H2O.",

(C)\nIntrapleural administration of sclerosing agents may be painful; signi /uniFB01 cant pain is reported in 7% patients receiving talc to 60% with historical agents such as doxycycline. 57 59 Discomfort can be reduced by administering local anaesthetic via the drain prior to pleurodesis. Lidocaine is the most frequently studied local anaesthetic for intrapleural administration. The onset of action of lidocaine is almost immediate and it should therefore be administered just before the sclerosant. The maximum dose of lidocaine is 3 mg/kg (21 ml of a 1% lidocaine solution for a 70 kg male), with a ceiling of 250 mg. The issue of safety has been highlighted in two studies. Wooten et al 60 showed that the mean peak serum concentration of lidocaine following 150 mg of intrapleural lidocaine was 1.3 m g/ml, well below the serum concentration associated with central nervous system side effects (ie, > 3 m g/ml). In an earlier study of 20 patients, larger doses of lidocaine were necessary to achieve acceptable levels of local anaesthesia. The patients receiving 250 mg lidocaine had more frequent pain-free episodes than those given 200 mg, while serum levels remained within the therapeutic range. Side effects were limited to transient paraesthesiae in a single patient. 61 The reason for the signi /uniFB01 cant difference in analgesia between the two groups with only a small increment in the lidocaine dose was unclear.\nThere are no studies to inform a recommendation on the use of premedication and sedation in non-thoracoscopic pleurodesis. Pleurodesis is an uncomfortable procedure and is associated with anxiety for the patient. The use of sedation may be helpful to allay such fears and induce amnesia. The level of sedation should be appropriate to relieve anxiety but suf /uniFB01 cient to maintain patient interaction. Sedation employed before pleurodesis should be conducted with continuous monitoring with pulse oximetry and in a setting where resuscitation equipment is available. 62 Further research is underway to address this issue.\n0699.

It may be administered in two ways: at thoracoscopy using an atomiser termed ' talc poudrage ' or via an intercostal tube in the form of a suspension termed ' talc slurry ' .\nSuccess rates (complete and partial response) for talc slurry range from 81% to 100%. 30 54 56 67 e 70 The majority of studies have used talc slurry alone and only a limited number of comparative studies have been published (see evidence table available on the BTS website at www.brit-thoracic.org.uk). A truncated randomised study by Lynch and colleagues 71 compared talc slurry (5 g) with bleomycin (60 000 units) and tetracycline (750 mg). Although the study was terminated early because of the removal of tetracycline from the US market, analysis of the data to that point revealed no differences between the three treatment groups 1 month after pleurodesis. In a randomised trial between talc slurry (5 g) and bleomycin (60 000 units), 90% of the talc group achieved a complete response at 2 weeks compared with 79% of the bleomycin group, which was statistically insigni /uniFB01 cant. 72 Three studies have\ndirectly compared talc slurry with talc poudrage (see evidence table available on the BTS website at www.brit-thoracic.org. uk). 73 e 75 For one randomised study the data are available only in abstract form. 73 It suggests superiority of poudrage over slurry, but limited data are available to validate this conclusion. Of the other two studies, Stefani et al compared medical thoracoscopy and talc poudrage with talc slurry in a non-randomised way. 75 Their results suggest superiority of poudrage over slurry, but the two groups were not equal with respect to performance status. In the largest study, Dresler et al compared a surgical approach to talc poudrage with talc slurry. 74 They concluded equivalence, but 44% of patients dropped out of the study before the 30-day end point due to deaths and a requirement of 90% lung reexpansion radiologically after intervention to be included in the analysis.\nThree studies have compared talc poudrage with other agents administered via an intercostal tube. One compared bleomycin (see below) and the other two tetracyclines (see evidence table available on the BTS website at www.brit-thoracic.org.uk). 76 e 78 Diacon et al concluded that talc insuf /uniFB02 ation at medical thoracoscopy was superior to bleomycin instillation on ef /uniFB01 cacy and cost grounds. 76 Kuzdzal et al and Fentiman et al both showed an advantage of talc insuf /uniFB02 ation over tetracyclines. 77 78 Each of the three studies analysed fewer than 40 patients.\nTalc slurry is usually well tolerated and pleuritic chest pain and mild fever are the most common side effects observed. A serious complication associated with the use of talc is adult respiratory distress syndrome or acute pneumonitis leading to acute respiratory failure. There have been many reports of pneumonitis associated with talc pleurodesis, although predominantly from the UK and the USA where historically non-graded talc has been used. 56 79 e 87 The mechanism of acute talc pneumonitis is unclear and has been reported with both talc poudrage and slurry. 56 80 This complication is related to the grade of talc used. Maskell and colleagues undertook two studies to determine this association. In the /uniFB01 rst study they randomised 20 patients to pleurodesis using either mixed talc or tetracycline and compared DTPA clearance in the contralateral lung with that undergoing pleurodesis at 48 h after pleurodesis. 88 DTPA clearance half time decreased by more in the talc group, which is a marker of increased lung in /uniFB02 ammation. There was also a greater arterial desaturation in those patients exposed to talc. In the second part of the study, graded (particle size > 15 m m) and non-graded (50% particle size < 15 m m) talc were compared. There was a greater alveolar e arterial oxygen gradient in the group exposed to non-graded talc at 48 h after pleurodesis. In a subsequent cohort study of 558 patients who underwent thoracoscopic pleurodesis using graded talc, there were no episodes of pneumonitis. 89\nTwo studies have investigated the systemic distribution of talc particles in rats after talc pleurodesis. The earlier study using uncalibrated talc found widespread organ deposition of talc particles in the lungs, heart, brain, spleen and kidneys at 48 h. The later study used calibrated talc and found liver and spleen deposition (but no lung deposition) at 72 h, but no evidence of pleurodesis in the treated lungs. 90 91 A further study in rabbits found greater systemic distribution of talc with ' normal ' (small particle talc). 92 This supports the evidence from clinical studies that large particle talc is preferable to small particle talc.",

(B)\nLocal tumour recurrence or seeding following diagnostic and therapeutic pleural aspiration, pleural biopsy, intercostal tube insertion and thoracoscopy is uncommon in non-mesothelioma malignant effusions. 110 e 113 However, in mesothelioma up to 40% of patients may develop malignant seeding at the site of pleural procedures. Three randomised studies have addressed the ef /uniFB01 cacy of procedure site radiotherapy to prevent tract metastasis (see evidence table available on the BTS website at www. brit-thoracic.org.uk). 114 e 116 Boutin and colleagues 114 found that local metastases were prevented in patients who received radiotherapy (21 Gy in three fractions) to the site of thoracoscopy. All the patients received radiotherapy within 2 weeks of thoracoscopy. The incidence of tract metastases in the control group in this study was 40%. This study was followed by a longitudinal study that supported its conclusions. 117 In two later studies including sites from a wider range of procedures such as needle biopsy and chest drain, the incidence of tract metastases was not signi /uniFB01 cantly different. Bydder and colleagues showed no bene /uniFB01 t of a single 10 Gy radiotherapy fraction to the intervention site in preventing recurrence. 116 All the patients received radiotherapy within 15 days of the procedure, but 46% of procedures were /uniFB01 ne needle aspirations. O ' Rourke and colleagues used the same radiotherapy dose as Boutin but to smaller /uniFB01 elds. They found no bene /uniFB01 t of radiotherapy, but again included a range of procedures including needle biopsy. The study included 60 patients but only 16 thoracoscopies, 7 in the radiotherapy group and 9 in the best supportive care group. Tract metastases occurred in 4 patients in the best supportive care group (a rate of 44%) and none in the radiotherapy group. 115 This is very similar to the incidence of tract metastasis in the study by Boutin et al (40%). The other procedures were pleural biopsies (45%) and chest tubes (25%). A longitudinal study by Agarwal et al found the highest rate of pleural tract metastases in association with thoracoscopy (16%), thoracotomy (24%) and chest tube (9%), but a much lower rate in association with pleural aspiration (3.6%) and image-guided biopsy (4.5%). 118 Careful analysis of the available data therefore supports the use of radiotherapy to reduce tract metastasis after signi /uniFB01 cant pleural instrumentation (thoracoscopy, surgery or large-bore chest drain), but not for less invasive procedures such as pleural biopsy or pleural aspiration. A larger study to specifically address this question would be of use.\nA cohort of 38 patients described by West et al reported an incidence of pleural tract metastasis after radiotherapy of 5%, but in these cases the metastasis occurred at the edge of the radiotherapy /uniFB01 eld. Of six patients who received radiotherapy after an indwelling pleural catheter, one subsequently developed pleural tract metastasis. 119 There are, at present, insuf /uniFB01 cient data on which to make a recommendation about the use of radiotherapy in the presence of indwelling pleural catheters.\nThe role of prophylactic radiotherapy following pleural procedures in non-mesothelioma malignant effusions has not been established and therefore cannot be recommended.",

Intrapleural streptokinase was well tolerated and no allergic or haemorrhagic complications were reported. 120 Gilkeson et al 121 preferred urokinase in their prospective but non-randomised study.

(B)\n< Thoracoscopic talc poudrage should be considered for the control of recurrent malignant pleural effusion. (B)\n< Thoracoscopy is a safe procedure with low complication rates. (B)\nThoracoscopy (under sedation or general anaesthesia) has grown in popularity as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool for malignant effusions. Under sedation, it is now widely used by respiratory physicians in the diagnosis and management of pleural effusions in patients with good performance status. 125 e 128 Patient selection for thoracoscopy and talc poudrage is important in view of the invasive nature of the procedure and cost. 129 A signi /uniFB01 cant bene /uniFB01 t of thoracoscopy is the ability to obtain a diagnosis, drain the effusion and perform a pleurodesis during the same procedure.\nThe diagnostic yield and accuracy of thoracoscopy for malignant effusions is > 90%. 99 125 127 130 131 Talc poudrage performed during thoracoscopy is an effective method for controlling malignant effusions with a pleurodesis success rate of 77 e 100%. 6 68 97 132 e 138 Randomised studies have established the superiority of talc poudrage over both bleomycin and tetracyclines (see evidence table available on the BTS website at www.brit-thoracic.org.uk). 73 76 e 78 One large randomised study comparing talc poudrage with talc slurry failed to establish\na difference in ef /uniFB01 cacy between the two techniques. 74 A further small non-randomised study comparing these two techniques also established equivalence. 133 A large study has established the safety of talc poudrage using large particle talc; no cases of respiratory failure were seen in this cohort of 558 patients. 89 Talc poudrage is known particularly to be effective in the presence of effusions due to carcinoma of the breast. 139\nThoracoscopy has less to offer in patients with a known malignant pleural effusion and a clearly trapped lung on the chest x-ray. However, under general anaesthesia, rein /uniFB02 ation of the lung under thoracoscopic vision will inform whether the lung is indeed trapped and therefore guide the decision to perform talc poudrage or insert a pleural catheter. The procedure can facilitate breaking up of loculations or blood clot in haemorrhagic malignant pleural effusion and can allow the release of adhesions and thereby aid lung re-expansion and apposition of the pleura for talc poudrage. 140 141\nThoracoscopy is a safe and well-tolerated procedure with a low perioperative mortality rate ( < 0.5%). 6 126 129 142 The most common major complications are empyema and acute respiratory failure secondary to infection or re-expansion pulmonary oedema, although the latter may be avoided by staged evacuation of pleural /uniFB02 uid and allowing air to replace the /uniFB02 uid. 127 129 143",

(B)\nInsertion of a tunnelled pleural catheter is an alternative method for controlling recurrent and symptomatic malignant effusions including patients with trapped lung. Several catheters have been developed for this purpose and the published studies employing them have reported encouraging results. 140 144 e 147 The presence of foreign material (silastic catheter) within the pleural space stimulates an in /uniFB02 ammatory reaction, and vacuum drainage bottles connected to the catheter every few days encourage re-expansion and obliteration of the pleural space. Most catheters can be removed after a relatively short period.\nIn the only randomised and controlled study to date, Putnam and colleagues 145 compared a long-term indwelling pleural catheter with doxycycline pleurodesis via a standard intercostal tube. The length of hospitalisation for the indwelling catheter group was signi /uniFB01 cantly shorter (1 day) than that of the doxycycline pleurodesis group (6 days). Spontaneous pleurodesis was achieved in 42 of the 91 patients in the indwelling catheter group. A late failure rate (de /uniFB01 ned as reaccumulation of pleural /uniFB02 uid after initial successful control) of 13% was reported compared with 21% for the doxycycline pleurodesis group. There was a modest improvement in the quality of life and dyspnoea scores in both groups. The complication rate was higher (14%) in the indwelling catheter group and included local cellulitis (most common) and, rarely, tumour seeding of the catheter tract.\nThe largest series to date reported on 250 patients, with at least partial symptom control achieved in 88.8%. Spontaneous pleurodesis occurred in 42.9% while catheters remained until death in 45.8%. 148 A more recent series of 231 patients treated with an indwelling catheter to drain pleural effusion reported a removal rate of 58% after spontaneous cessation of drainage, with only 3.8% reaccumulation and 2.2% infection. 147 This group included those with trapped lung (12.5% of all patients) or who had failed other therapy. A further series of 48 patients reported a spontaneous pleurodesis rate of 48%. 149 Pien et al studied a group of 11 patients in whom an indwelling catheter\n0699. Protected by copyright.\nwas placed speci /uniFB01 cally for a malignant effusion in the presence of trapped lung; 10 patients reported symptomatic improvement. 144\nA recent series of 45 patients reported by Janes et al described three cases of catheter tract metastasis associated with indwelling pleural catheters occurring between 3 weeks and 9 months after insertion. Metastases occurred in 2 of 15 patients with mesothelioma but in only 1 of 30 patients with other metastatic malignancy. 150\nAn indwelling pleural catheter is therefore an effective option for controlling recurrent malignant effusions when length of hospitalisation is to be kept to a minimum (reduced life expectancy) or where patients are known or are suspected to have trapped lung and where expertise and facilities exist for outpatient management of these catheters. Although there is a signi /uniFB01 cant cost associated with the disposable vacuum drainage bottles that connect to indwelling pleural catheters, there may be a cost reduction associated with reduced length of hospital stay or avoidance of hospital admission.",
