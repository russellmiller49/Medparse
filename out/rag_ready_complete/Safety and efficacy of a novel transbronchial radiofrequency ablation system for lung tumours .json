      "content": "Lung cancer, a malignancy associated with significant mortality, has witnessed a rising incidence in recent years. 1 Surgical resection is the preferred radical treatment of pulmonary malignancies; however, it is contraindicated in certain patients with surgically resectable lung cancer due to the presence of cardiopulmonary comorbidities. 2 Targeted ablation techniques, such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA), have been employed to treat patients with peripheral lung tumours deemed unsuitable for surgery. 3\nThe RFA catheter induces local coagulation necrosis by heating tissue above 60 /C14 C based on the electric currentbased technique. 4 The efficacy of RFA in the treatment of lung tumours has been demonstrated in previous studies. 5 However, the relatively high incidence of procedure-related complications, such as pneumothorax, haemoptysis and haemothorax, has limited the clinical application of RFA, particularly the percutaneous approach. 6 Additionally, the elevated lung impedance can lead to tissue carbonization and disrupt electrical conduction, thereby restricting the ablation range even with increased power and prolonged duration of ablation. 7,8\nTransbronchial RFA, performed through a bronchoscopic path, is a theoretically safe approach as it facilitates avoiding injury to the neurovascular structures and pleura. Advances in bronchial navigation techniques has enabled the precise positioning of the bronchoscope. 9 Our previous study developed a novel RFA system with automatic saline microperfusion, which reduces tissue impedance by infusing saline into the lung tissue to diminish air content. This technique also facilitates real-time monitoring of lesion temperature and dynamic adjustment of the saline infusion rates and power output. 10 The safety and feasibility of this system have been preliminarily validated through preclinical animal experiments. However, the clinical efficacy and safety of this\nsystem remain to be established. Therefore, this prospective clinical trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of transbronchial RFA for the treatment of peripheral lung tumours.",

      "content": "During the screening period, all patients will undergo positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scans for tumour restaging. The bronchoscopic pathway was planned prior to RFA using the virtual navigation bronchoscopy system (LungPro, Broncus Medical, Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). All patients underwent induction of general anaesthesia with muscle relaxation and mechanical ventilation. An RFA catheter (diameter 1.85 mm) was used in conjunction with a bronchoscope (BF-P290 and BF-1TQ290; Olympus). Saline infusion was continuous during the RFA procedure, and the infusion rate was dynamically adjusted according to the real-time temperature, aimed at maintaining the temperature of the ablation zone at 60 -90 /C14 C. The target bronchus was accessed under the guidance of the LungPro navigation system. The accessibility of the target lesion was re-confirmed using cone-beam computed tomography (CT) imaging (Cios Spin ® , Siemens Healthcare GmbH, Erlangen, Germany). Ablation was initiated after confirming that the RFA catheter was precisely positioned within the pulmonary lesion on cross-sectional, coronal and sagittal views (Figure 2). Transbronchial RFA was recommended to be performed with 20 Watts of power for 10 min to achieve an ablation zone size of 2.5 -3.0 cm. 10 In clinical practice, the bronchoscopist can modify the ablation parameters according to the lesion ' s characteristics. Under cone-beam CT, successful ablation is identified when the Post-Ablation Target Zone (PTZ) -an opaque, high-density area adjacent to the tumour after ablation -surrounds the Gross Tumour Region (GTR) and is encompasses the GTR of 5-10 mm. If the PTZ does not fully encompass the target lesion after the initial procedure, the catheter route can be adjusted to perform additional ablations. Follow-up data (clinical assessments, laboratory tests, lung function, contrast-enhanced CT or PET-CT) were collected and analysed at the following time points: preoperatively; 24 h postoperatively; before discharge/7 days postoperatively\n(whichever occurred first); and 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after RFA treatment. Patients diagnosed with multiple pulmonary malignancies ( ≥ 2 lesions) underwent a second RFA within 2 weeks. For patients undergoing anticancer therapy (chemotherapy, targeted therapy or immunotherapy) but experiencing tumour progression or requiring ongoing treatment due to tumour metastasis or metastatic tumours, their original anticancer regimen was maintained during the follow-up period.\nComplementary ablation is an essential and scheduled component of the RFA regimen. The patients were followed up as planned after the completion of transbronchial RFA. The ablation effect was first evaluated at the 3-month follow-up visit. A comprehensive assessment involving radiologists, pulmonologists and investigators was performed to determine the efficacy of the initial ablation. A complementary RFA was recommended if the effects were insufficient. The procedure was completed within 2 weeks of the originally planned follow-up, and the subsequent 6-month post-procedure follow-up was extended by 2 weeks. All other initially scheduled follow-up timeframes remained unchanged.",

Among the 377 adverse events, 317 were mild and required no additional treatment. No device defects were reported during the RFA operation. Approximately 42.97% of adverse events were definitively unrelated to the RFA procedure, while 16.98% were clearly associated with the procedure. In terms of severe adverse events, eight cases were related to the RFA procedure. Apart from one patient who succumbed to haemoptysis (as detailed below), all other patients fully recovered following appropriate treatment. Respiratory disorders, such as pneumothorax (3.97%), haemoptysis (6.35%), pleural effusion (8.73%), pulmonary infection (11.11%) and pleural pain (10.32%), were the most frequently reported adverse events. No cases of haemothorax during the follow-up period. Apart from one patient who died due to massive haemoptysis, the remaining haemoptysis cases presented as bloodtinged sputum. For those patients experiencing fever and/or pleural effusion, nine were administered NSAIDs for symptom relief. Three patients developed pneumothorax, while another three presented with pleural effusion prior to discharge, necessitating additional chest drainage and prolonged hospital stays. (Table 3).\nThe mortality rate at enrollment was 1.59% (2/126 patients). A 71-year-old male patient with compromised lung function was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the right upper lobe of the lung. The pulmonary lesion was a solid nodule (23.00 mm /C2 15.50 mm in size) positioned adjacent to a vessel and cavity. No anticoagulant medications was used prior to the procedure. The patient developed a fever, and pulmonary infection was confirmed 24 h post-ablation (22 Watts for 25 min) via CT imaging. The patient did not respond to anti-infectious treatment, and his condition deteriorated steadily. Haemoptysis was observed on the eighth day post-RFA, and multiple patchy shadows and ablation-related cavities in the lungs were observed on CT images (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information). The patient died of massive haemoptysis despite effective antibiotic and haemostatic treatment.\na In comparison to the other groups, p < 0.05.\nB)\n100-\nTotal\nSolid lesion\n90\nPure and\nmixed GGO\n[\n80\nHazard ratio (HR): 5.95 (2.04\n17.33)\np=0.0011\n70\n100\n200\n300\n400\nDays\nA 67-year-old female patient diagnosed with advanced lung cancer underwent RFA successfully; however, the patient died of tumour progression and multiple organ failure 9 months after ablation treatment.\nAmong the 126 eligible patients, pulmonary function data were available for all patients before treatment and 109 patients at 12 months. No significant deterioration in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) ratio, or diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) was observed at any follow-up visit. Slight decreases observed in these values were not statistically significant or clinically relevant. (Table S5 in the Supporting Information).",

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "content": "This is the first prospective, large-sample size, multi-centre clinical study to determine the efficacy of transbronchial RFA for the treatment of lung tumours. An RFA technical success rate of 99.3%, generating an initial ablation range of >3 cm along the long axis, was observed in the present study. The complete ablation rate at the 12-month followup visit was 90.3% for all lung tumours and 97.10% for pure or mixed GGNs. Transbronchial RFA displayed commendable safety. Moreover, most adverse events were mild. Pneumothorax and haemoptysis were observed in only 3.97% and 6.35% of patients, respectively.\nRFA, a minimally invasive technique that was initially introduced in 2000, has been widely used in the treatment of pulmonary malignancies. 5 Previous studies have shown that percutaneous RFA is feasible and effective for the treatment of lung tumours. 13,14 However, the elevated lung impedance can result in tissue carbonization and disrupt electrical conduction, thereby limiting the ablation range even with increased power and prolonged duration of ablation. 8 Moreover, the potential risks of percutaneous RFA-related complications, such as pneumothorax and haemoptysis, must be highlighted. 15,16 A program-controlled saline microperfusion system was introduced to reduce the amount of air within the lung tissue and improve the conduction efficiency of the radiofrequency energy. The infusion rate and energy output were dynamically adjusted according to the real-time temperature such that the impedance at the distal end of the catheter remained relatively stable and the temperature was maintained between 60 and 90 /C14 C. 10 Thus, a larger ablation range and higher rate of complete ablation was observed during RFA treatment, which resulted in a reduction in the influence of the heat sink effect.\nEfficacy of transbronchial RFA was preliminary evaluated in this 1-year follow-up. The 12-month local control rate of transbronchial RFA observed in the present study was superior to that reported in other small simple size transbronchial RFA studies (90.32% vs. 82.60%). 17 GGNs, which account for over 60% of primary lung cancer diagnoses, 18 usually occur when the lung alveoli are partially filled with fluid or cells that contain a certain amount of air,\nthereby resulting in high tissue impedance. 19 The saline microperfusion system effectively reduced the air content in the local lung tissue via the perfusion of saline into the alveolar cavity. Moreover, this system aided in achieving a complete ablation rate of 100% and 96.0% in patients with pure GGN and mixed GGN, respectively. The findings of the present study are comparable with those of microwave ablation or SBRT for GGN (1 year local control rate, microwave ablation: 94.3%, SBRT: 100%); however, further follow-up is required. 20,21\nPrevious studies have not reported any major adverse events related to transbronchial RFA. 17,22,23 Nevertheless, the safety profile of transbronchial RFA remains unclear owing to the limited sample size. Almost all transbronchial RFA procedures were completed without intraoperative complications in the present study. The majority of adverse events were mild and unrelated to the RFA procedure. Most severe adverse events were effectively managed through appropriate treatments. The nature of complications observed in the present study closely resembled those observed after percutaneous RFA. Transbronchial RFA resulted in reduced incidence of procedure-related complications compared with percutaneous RFA. Pneumothorax and haemoptysis were observed in 3.97% (vs. 28.4%) and 6.35% (vs. 12.0%) of patients, respectively. 24,25 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common comorbidity observed in 30% -70% of patients with lung cancer. 26 -28 Poor lung function limits the efficacy of surgical treatment, and an increased risk of pneumothorax has been associated with pulmonary hyperinflation. 29 In this study, 21 of the total 126 patients with emphysema were treated with transbronchial RFA. The procedure did not affect lung function in these patients, and pneumothorax was observed in 2/21 of patients.\nFormation of a massive cavity following ablation is the primary cause of massive haemoptysis. Ablation-related cavitation has been observed in 14% -17% of patients within 3.1 ± 1.7 days post percutaneous RFA. 30 Most patients who develop cavitation remain asymptomatic; however, such a cavity can enlarge over time or rupture in some cases, leading to the incidence of pneumothorax and haemorrhage. 31 Clinicians need to be vigilant for the formation of cavitations in the lesion within 1 week after RFA. Assess the risk of haemoptysis using enhanced CT or angiography in patients with significantly enlarged cavities is essential. 32 It is crucial to promptly identify the source of bleeding; ensure airway patency; and intervene using methods, such as thrombin injection or pulmonary artery embolization, in patients with symptoms of haemoptysis. 33\nThis study has several limitations. First, the follow-up duration of the present study was relatively short; therefore, further studies must be conducted to determine the longterm effects of transbronchial RFA. Similarly, the survival analysis for patients with different natures of lesions in this study requires further validation. The original medical treatments, such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy or immunotherapy, were continued during follow-up. Thus, evaluating the specific impact of these therapies on tumour progression\nwas challenging. Lastly, this was a single-arm study that lacked a direct comparison with percutaneous RFA, microwave ablation, or radiotherapy. Further studies must be conducted to definitively demonstrate the advantages of transbronchial RFA.\nIn conclusion, the findings from this 12-month followup study provide preliminary evidence supporting the feasibility and safety of transbronchial RFA incorporating an automatic saline microperfusion system. Superior local tumour control was observed in patients with GGN. This pioneering large-scale, multi-centre clinical trial provides strong evidence for the development and integration of transbronchial ablation as a treatment modality for lung tumours. Long-term follow-up studies are currently underway to corroborate these promising results and to further elucidate the role of transbronchial RFA in the comprehensive management of lung cancer.",
