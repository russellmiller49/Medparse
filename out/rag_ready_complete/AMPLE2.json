The optimal regimen of drainage after indwelling pleural catheter insertion is debated and ranges from aggressive (daily) drainage to drainage only when symptomatic. Methods AMPLE-2 was an open-label randomised trial involving 11 centres in Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Malaysia. Patients with symptomatic malignant pleural e/uniFB00usions were randomly assigned (1:1) to the aggressive (daily) or symptom-guided drainage groups for 60 days and minimised by cancer type (mesothelioma vs others), performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] score 0-1 vs ≥2), presence of trapped lung, and prior pleurodesis. Patients were followed up for 6 months. The primary outcome was mean daily breathlessness score, measured by use of a 100 mm visual analogue scale during the first 60 days. Secondary outcomes included rates of spontaneous pleurodesis and self-reported quality-of-life measures. Results were analysed by an intention-totreat approach. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12615000963527. Findings Between July 20, 2015, and Jan 26, 2017, 87 patients were recruited and randomly assigned to the aggressive (n=43) or symptom-guided (n=44) drainage groups. The mean daily breathlessness scores did not di/uniFB00er significantly between the aggressive and symptom-guided drainage groups (geometric means 13 · 1 mm [95% CI 9·8-17·4] vs 17·3 mm [13·0-22·0]; ratio of geometric means 1·32 [95% CI 0·88-1·97]; p=0·18). More patients in the aggressive group developed spontaneous pleurodesis than in the symptom-guided group in the first 60 days (16 [37·2%] of 43 vs five [11·4%] of 44, p=0·0049) and at 6 months (19 [44·2%] vs seven [15·9%], p=0·004; hazard ratio 3·287 [95% CI 1·396-7·740]; p=0·0065). Patient-reported quality-of-life measures, assessed with EuroQoL-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L), were better in the aggressive group than in the symptom-guided group (estimated means 0·713 [95% CI 0·647-0·779] vs 0·601 [0·536-0·667]). The estimated di/uniFB00erence in means was 0·112 (95% CI 0·0198-0·204; p=0·0174). Pain scores, total days spent in hospital, and mortality did not di/uniFB00er significantly between groups. Serious adverse events occurred in 11 (25·6%) of 43 patients in the aggressive drainage group and in 12 (27·3%) of 44 patients in the symptom-guided drainage group, including 11 episodes of pleural infection in nine patients (five in the aggressive group and six in the symptom-guided drainage group).

Few data exist to guide drainage  approaches  for  patients  with  an  indwelling pleural catheter. Practices vary worldwide, ranging from aggressive  (daily  or  alternate­day)  drainage,  often  used in centres in the USA, 6  to drainage only when symptoms develop,  which  is  common  in  the  rest  of  the  world. These di/uniFB00erences in practice could potentially influence outcomes and complication rates.\nAggressive  daily  drainage  arguably  keeps  the  pleural space dry and provides best symptom control every day, whereas health­care practitioners who advocate symptom­ guided  drainage  contend  that  the  goal  of  malignant pleural  e/uniFB00usion  care  is  palliation  and  that  drainage  of indwelling pleural catheter is only indicated  when symptoms  arise.  The  symptom­guided  approach  might reduce a substantial amount of burden and consumable costs compared with daily drainage, and might reduce the risk of iatrogenic introduction of pleural infection.\nConversely, frequent indwelling pleural catheter drainage  might  facilitate  approximation  of  the  visceral and parietal pleura and facilitate their symphysis (so­called  spontaneous  pleurodesis),  and  allow  removal of  the  catheter.  Daily  drainage  has  been  shown  to promote pleurodesis more e/uniFB00ectively than alternate­day drainage. 6 Whether a symptom­guided approach a/uniFB00ects the rate of pleurodesis is unknown.\nThe Australasian Malignant PLeural E/uniFB00usion­2 (AMPLE­2) study was designed to address the equipoise between aggressive (daily) versus symptom­guided approaches  to  indwelling  pleural  catheter  drainage  in patients with a malignant pleural e/uniFB00usion-specifically, their  e/uniFB03cacy  in  breathlessness  control,  induction  of pleurodesis, improvement of quality of life, reduction of days spent in hospital, and complication rates. 7",

      "content": "Malignant pleural effusions often require pleural intervention for symptom control. Results of two multicentre trials have confirmed that an indwelling pleural catheter provides similar benefits to conventional talc slurry pleurodesis with regard to symptom control and quality of life. The AMPLE-1 randomised trial found that an indwelling pleural catheter provided added advantages over talc pleurodesis in reducing days spent in hospital, in patients' remaining lifespan, and in minimising the need for repeat invasive pleural drainage procedures. Having established the advantages and safety of indwelling pleural catheter insertion for management of malignant pleural effusions, the next step was to optimise its effectiveness by identifying its best drainage regimen. We searched PubMed for articles published before March 1, 2018, using the terms 'malignant pleural effusion' AND 'indwelling pleural catheter OR IPC' AND 'drainage frequency' AND 'breathlessness OR dyspnoea'. The only randomised controlled trial in the 11 articles found compared rates of spontaneous pleurodesis between daily drainage versus alternate-day drainage in 149 patients with malignant pleural effusions. However, many clinicians preferred drainage only when patients developed symptomatic breathlessness, as malignant pleural effusion management is mainly palliative. Aggressive (daily) versus infrequent symptom-guided drainage regimens have not been compared but have substantial implications for clinical care.",

Patients were randomly assigned within 72 h of indwelling  pleural  catheter  insertion  after  maximum pleural fluid evacuation to ensure the same baseline for all  patients.  In  the  aggressive  drainage  group,  patients (or their carers or community nurses) were asked to drain the malignant pleural e/uniFB00usion via the in  dwelling pleural catheter every day for the first 60 days unless clinically contraindicated, or unless spontaneous pleurodesis had occurred. For the symptom­guided group, patients carried  out  drainage  when  they  had  e/uniFB00usion­related symptoms  (usually breathlessness, cough, or chest tightness). The indwelling pleural catheter was accessed at  least  fortnightly  to  ensure  it  remained  patent  and  to assess whether fluid was still being produced.\nPatients were supplied with standard indwelling pleural  catheter  vacuum­suction  bottles  (600  mL)  for fluid drainage, following instructions of the manufact­ urer. Pleurodesis was defined as less than 50 mL of fluid removed at three consecutive drainages 6 (in the aggressive drainage group) or at two attempts 2 weeks apart (in the  symptom­guided  group),  and  in  the absence of substantial residual pleural fluid collections on imaging.\nAll patients and carers were given a standard briefing about  the  drainage  method,  aftercare,  and  potential complications, and had ready access to support services (eg,  via  direct  phone  line)  for  any  concerns.  They were free to receive other treatments including  chemo­ irradiation and palliative care  as  recommended  by treating  clinicians.  Patients  were  followed  up  for  a minimum  of  6  months  after  randomisation  or  until death,  whichever  occurred  first.  The  drainage  regimen after 60 days was left to the discretion of the attending clinicians.\nPatients  kept  a  logbook  of  their  breathlessness  score recorded every day for 60 days and then weekly until the end of the study. The breathlessness score was measured by use of a validated 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS), a 100 mm line anchored with 'best breathing' at 0 mm and 'worst breathing imaginable' at 100 mm. The pain level was also measured on a 100 mm VAS, which was anchored with 'no pain' at 0 mm and 'worst imaginable pain' at 100 mm. 8 The volume of pleural fluid removed at each drainage was also recorded.\nBaseline clinical data, VAS scores for breathlessness 4,5,9 and pain, and quality­of­life measures (VAS and EuroQoL­5 Dimensions­5 Levels [EQ­5D­5L] 10 ) were collected before indwelling pleural catheter insertion and after randomisation (within 72 h after insertion).

This outcome was further supported in analyses adjusting for minimisation variables and including random centre e/uniFB00ects (geometric  mean  16·3  mm [95% CI 11·3-23·7] with aggressive drainage vs 21·0 mm [14·8-29·7] with symptom­guided  drainage, p=0·21; ratio of geometric means 1·28 [95% CI 0·86-1·91]) and was  consistent  when  multiple  imputation  was  done  to account for missing logbook entries.\nThe  frequency  of  spontaneous  pleurodesis  was  sig­ nificantly higher in the aggressive drainage group (16 [37·2%] of 43 patients) than in the symptom­guided group in the first 60 days (five [11·4%] of 44; p=0·0049), and  after 6  months  (19  [44·2%] vs seven [15·9%], p=0·004). The competing risk survival model indicated\nhigher likelihood of development of spontaneous pleurodesis in the aggressive drainage group than in the symptom­guided group (Hazard ratio (HR) 3·287, 95% CI 1·396-7·740; p=0·0065; figure 3). These results were consistent after adjusting for minimisation variables (Hazard ratio (HR) 3·429 [95% CI 1·413-8·320]; p=0·0064).\nWe  compared  patients  with  non­trapped  (n=59)  and trapped lungs (n=28) in a post­hoc analysis. Spontaneous pleurodesis  was  more  common  in  those  with  non­ trapped lungs than in those with trapped lungs (17  [28·8%] vs four  [14·3%])  at  60  days  but  not  at 6 months (18 [30·5%] vs eight [28·6%]). In the aggressive drainage group, spontaneous pleurodesis developed in 12  (41·4%)  patients  with  non­trapped  lungs  compared with four (28·6%) with trapped lungs at 60 days and in 12 (41·4%) compared with seven (50·0%) at 6 months. In the  symptom­guided  group,  spontaneous  pleurodesis developed  in  five  (16·7%)  patients  with  non­trapped lungs, compared with none in those with trapped lungs at 60 days and in six (20·0%) compared with one (7·1%) at 6 months. The Kaplan­Meier estimated median time to  pleurodesis was 121 days in the aggressive drainage group, including in those with trapped and non­trapped lungs.  The  success  rate  was  too  low  in  the  symptom­ guided group to provide a reliable Kaplan­Meier estimate of the median time to pleurodesis.\nThe mean VAS pain score during the first 60 days of the  trial  was  10·74  mm  (SD  12·80)  in  the  aggressive drainage group and 16·31 mm (16·58) in the symptom­ guided group  (figure  4),  with  no  significant  di/uniFB00erence between  the  groups  (ratio  of  geometric  means  1·28 [95% CI 0·76-2·18], p=0·35).\nIn a linear mixed model of response to EQ­5D­5L, no interaction  between  time  and  treatment  was  detected, and  patient­reported  quality­of­life  measures  over  the study  period  and  follow­up  visits  were  better  in  the aggressive drainage group than in the symptom­guided drainage group (estimated means 0·713 [95% CI 0·647-0·779] vs 0·601  [0·536-0·667]).  The  estimated di/uniFB00erence  in  means  was  0·112  (95%  CI  0·0198-0·204; p=0·0174). This finding was consistent after adjusting for minimisation  variables  and  baseline  EQ­5D­5L  index values  (estimated  di/uniFB00erence  in  means  0·097  [95%  CI 0·004-0·191], p=0·0408). No between­group di/uniFB00erences were found in the VAS quality­of­life scores during the study  visits  (ratio  of  geometric  means  1·220  [95%  CI 0·871-1·709], p=0·25). For all visit times for both groups there was concordance in the measures of EQ­5D­5L and the VAS quality­of­life score with significant correlations at  most  visit  times  and  moderate  to  high  correlations throughout (appendix).\nThe  median  number  of  hospital  admissions  for  the entire cohort was one [IQR 0-2] for the first 60 days and two  [1-3]  at  6  months.

In  the  first  60  days,  ten  (23·3%) patients in the aggressive drainage group and nine  (20·5%)  in  the  symptom­guided  drainage  group died (estimated di/uniFB00erence in proportions 0·028, 95% CI -0·146  to  0·202,  p=0·75).  By  6  months,  18  (41·9%) patients in the aggressive drainage group and 19 (43·2%) in the symptom­guided drainage group had died (estimated  di/uniFB00erence  in  proportions  -0·013,  95%  CI -0·221 to 0·195, p=0·90).\nPatients with better performance status by ECOG score also had longer survival (Hazard ratio (HR) 0·399 [95% CI 0·203-0·785] for death [ for better to poorer ECOG status], p=0·0078) at 6 months.\nThe total numbers and proportions of patients with one or more adverse event or serious adverse event are presented in table 3. Of the 32 serious adverse events and 46 adverse events recorded, 11 (four serious adverse events and seven adverse events) were deemed definitely  not  related  to  the  trial  intervention  by  an independent  assessor.  11  patients  in  the  aggressive drainage group and 12 in the symptom­guided drainage group  had  serious  adverse  events.  Adverse  events occurred in 13 patients in the aggressive drainage group and in 22 in the symptom­guided drainage group. In the symptom­guided group, the most common adverse event  was  pain  at  the  indwelling  pleural  catheter  site requiring narcotics (n=12). Worsening dyspnoea due to ipsilateral pleural e/uniFB00usion despite drainage occurred in six patients, which usually responded well to increasing drainage frequency.\n11  episodes  of  pleural  infection  developed  (five  in the aggressive drainage group and six in the symp  t  om­guided drainage group) in nine patients over 6  months.

      "content": "This multicentre randomised controlled trial showed no di/uniFB00erences between the aggressive (daily) and the symptom­guided drainage approaches in providing breathlessness control over the first 60 days after indwelling  pleural  catheter  insertion.  There  were  no significant between­group di/uniFB00erences in pain, days spent  in  hospital,  or  survival.  Aggressive drainage was associated  with  a  higher  rate  of  pleurodesis  and  better EQ­5D­5L index values than symptom­guided drainage. Serious adverse events were uncommon in either group.\nMalignant  pleural  e/uniFB00usions are  common  and  a/uniFB00ect about a third of patients with lung and breast cancers and the  majority  of  patients  with  mesothelioma.  Malignant pleural e/uniFB00usion often heralds incurable cancers and limited prognosis. 18 Control of the associated breathlessness frequently requires invasive pleural procedures. Use of an indwelling pleural catheter presents an  alternative to conventional  talc  pleurodesis,  and  has  been  shown  to reduce  days  spent  in  hospital, 5,19 and  the  need  for  repeat\nTable 2: Data of hospital admissions in episodes and duration by treatment groups\nHazard ratio (HR)=hazard ratio.\npleural interventions in the patient's remaining life­ span. 4,5 The use of indwelling pleural catheters is growing rapidly,  especially  in  developed  countries,  and  is  often advocated as the first­line definitive therapy for malignant pleural e/uniFB00usion. 20 Ambulatory indwelling pleural catheter drainages  do  require  resources  (time  of  carers  and/or community nurses, and consumables) and can theoretic­ ally  intro  duce  infections. 21 Two  approaches  to  indwelling pleural catheter management-aggressive and symptom­ guided drainage-have evolved and are at equipoise.\nOur study found no significant di/uniFB00erences in breathlessness control, the principal goal of malignant pleural  e/uniFB00usion  palliation,  whether  the  patients  did drainages daily or as guided by symptoms. These data are  reassuring  and  imply  that,  if  assigned  to  do  so, patients were able to recognise early, or anticipate, their symptoms and perform drainages before any discomfort reached a level of impact.\nHowever, aggressive daily fluid removal did promote more e/uniFB00ective  pleurodesis.  Keeping  the  pleural  cavity fluid­free  theoretically  allows  better  approximation  of the  visceral  and  parietal  pleura  and  thus  adhesion formation and pleural symphysis. Conversely, permit­ ting asymptomatic accumulation of the pleural fluid in between symptom­guided drainages might have physically  impaired  pleural  symphysis.  A  previous randomised controlled trial also found that spontaneous pleurodesis occurred more commonly with daily rather than alternate­day drainages. 6\nSpontaneous  pleurodesis  in  the  aggressive  drainage group mostly developed within the first 60 days, consistent  with  the  timeframe  from  published  data. 6,17 In  our  protocol,  the  drainage  schedules  after  60  days were left  to  the  choice  of  the  attending  clinicians  and patients.  Without  the  suggestion  of  slowing  down drainage,  many  patients  might  have  adopted  a  less aggressive approach. Whether prolonging daily drainage beyond 60 days will facilitate late pleurodesis requires further research.\nOur study is one of the very few randomised controlled trials  that  included  patients  with  a  trapped  lung,  which accounted  for  a  third  of  the  cohort,  consistent  with commonly  quoted  data.  Those  with  trapped  lung  had (expectedly)  a  lower  rate  of  pleurodesis  than  did  those with an expandable lung, though aggressive drainage was still associated with a higher pleurodesis rate even in the trapped  lung  group.  The  exact  mechanism  will  need exploration, although it is possible that in some cases the trapped  lung  can  slowly  expand  with  time,  concurrent therapy,  or  a  combination  of  both,  and  allow  pleural symphysis.  Alternatively,  the  trapped  space  might  be small and  when  su/uniFB03cient adhesions  or loculations develop over time, no further fluid drainage is necessary. Nonetheless,  future  studies  should  incorporate  patients with trapped lung to guide best care.\nReassuringly,  aggressive  drainage was not associated with  more  pain  or  infection  than  that  observed  with symptom­guided  drainage.  Pleural  infection  related  to an  indwelling  pleural  catheter  a/uniFB00ected  about  5%  of patients  in  our  previous  international  study. 22 Daily access of the catheter might  increase  the  risks  of introducing microbes; however, pleural drainage is the key to empyema management, and aggressive drainage might ensure prompt removal of any microbes that have entered  the  pleural  cavity.  There  were  also  no  major di/uniFB00erences  in  the  frequency  of  other  serious  adverse events or survival between the two groups. More adverse events were observed in the symptom­guided drainage group, especially dyspnoea attributed to pleural e/uniFB00usion, most  of  which  responded  to  increased  frequency  of drainage.\nPatients  in  the  aggressive drainage  group  reported better EQ­5D­5L index values, despite no clear benefits in their reported breathlessness or pain scores. There is no minimal clinically important di/uniFB00erence  specifically\nassigned  for  patients  with  malignant  pleural  e/uniFB00usion for EQ­5D­5L or VAS quality­of­life scores. In our study, the  between­group  di/uniFB00erence  of  the  EQ­5D­5L  index value was 0·112, which is above the minimal clinically important  di/uniFB00erence  of  0·09  defined  by  Pickard  and colleagues 23 in  patients  with  advanced  cancers.  Daily removal  of  the  fluid  might  have  provided  benefits  in symptoms  not  captured  with  our  breathlessness  and pain measurements. The higher pleurodesis rate, with resultant freedom from fluid (and symptom) recurrence and of the catheter, might have contributed to the better reported quality of life. Additionally, it has been suggested  that  indwelling  pleural  catheter  drainage gives patients an important sense of control when they are feeling helpless with their advancing cancer. Whether this e/uniFB00ect  can explain the scores observed in our study remains to be tested. The two quality­of­life instruments  both  showed  improvements  and  good correlations  of  the  values  between  the  EQ­5D­5L  and VAS  quality­of­life scores at each  time  point.  The between­group di/uniFB00erences were significant with EQ­5D­5L but not with VAS quality­of­life scores. This di/uniFB00erence  might  be  related  to  the  sensitivity  of  the instruments in detecting changes in this patient population, but this is a topic for future studies.\nDeveloping  the  full  potential  of  indwelling  pleural catheters in malignant pleural e/uniFB00usion care is a topic of active research. Combining an indwelling pleural catheter with pleurodesis, either by instillation 17 via the catheter or coating 24 of  the  catheter  with  a  pleurodesing  agent, appears promising. Defining the best drainage regimen will  hold  an  even  more  important  role  if  instillation  of pleurodesing agents becomes routine practice. A randomised trial 17 showed  that  instillation  of  talc  slurry (followed by indwelling pleural catheter drainage two to three times a week) induced a higher rate of pleurodesis than saline control. However, the success rate in the talc group was low (around 43%), similar to what was achieved with aggressive drainage (without talc) in our trial. The results of our trial and the ASAP study 6 both confirm that daily indwelling pleural catheter fluid removal enhances spontaneous  pleurodesis,  which  is  adopted  now  into protocols of ongoing studies (eg, EPIToME and OPTIMUM 25 )  evaluating  talc  instillation  via  indwelling pleural catheter.\nOur  study  has  various  limitations.  First,  the  primary endpoint  was  set  at  60  days  as  this  reflects  the  short median  survival  of patients  with  malignant  pleural e/uniFB00usion  from  lung  cancers  (the  most  common  type  of malignant  pleural  e/uniFB00usion  globally).  We  did,  however, also include many  patients with malignant  pleural e/uniFB00usions  from mesothelioma (the subtype with longest median  survival  among  common  causes  of  malignant pleural  e/uniFB00usions).  Our  results  did  not  di/uniFB00er  between patients with non­mesothelioma and those with mesothelioma.  Second,  the  definition  of  spontaneous pleurodesis  used  in  the  published  literature  describes\ncessation  of  fluid  formation,  which  might  relate  to treatment or the natural disease course, but not necessarily  to  symphysis  of  the  visceral  and  parietal pleura  (the  true  meaning  of  pleurodesis).  Ultrasound assessment was available in a subset of 18 patients who had spontaneous pleurodesis in the lead centre; all but one achieved sonographic appearances of pleural symphysis.  Third,  the  consumable  and  carer  costs  of daily drainage vary substantially around  the world. However,  this  study  has  provided  an  approximation  of the amount of drainage consumables needed for aggressive and symptom­guided drainage, which would allow clinicians to estimate local costs of each regimen. Fourth,  as  our  study  was  an  open  label  study,  the use of patient­reported measures could potentially contain bias.\nData  from  recently  published  randomised  controlled trials in malignant pleural e/uniFB00usion manage  ment support the  use  of  an  indwelling  pleural  catheter  as  first­choice definitive management in patients with malignant pleural e/uniFB00usion, 4,5,26,27 but the optimal drainage schedule must be identified to realise the full potential of this intervention. The  AMPLE­2  trial  showed  that  either  aggressive  or symptom­guided drainage regimens are adequate in providing  breathlessness  control.  However,  daily  fluid removal  enhances  spontaneous  pleurodesis  and  might improve quality of life without any drawbacks in relation to pain,  infection  rates,  or  survival.  In  patients  in  whom pleurodesis  is  an  important  goal  (eg,  those  undertaking strategies  involving  an  indwelling  pleural  catheter  plus pleurodesing agents), aggressive drainage should be done for at least 60 days. Future studies will need to establish if more aggressive (eg, twice daily) regimens for the initial phase could further enhance success rates. 28 However, for patients  whose  primary  care  aim  is  palliation  (eg, those with  very  limited  life  expectancy  or  significant  trapped lung  where  pleurodesis  is  unlikely),  our  data  show  that symptom­guided  drainage o/uniFB00ers  an  e/uniFB00ective  means  of breathlessness  control  without  the  inconvenience  and costs of daily drainages. The ability to predict the likelihood of pleurodesis will help guide the choice of regimen and should be a topic of future studies.",
