    "abstract": "Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare disease characterized by alveolar accumulation of surfactant material with resulting hypoxemia and reduced lung function. Whole lung lavage (WLL) to physically remove the proteinaceous material from the affected lung is the standard treatment. Since its original description in 1964, there have been increasing numbers of WLL procedures done worldwide and the technique has been variously refined and modified. When done in experienced centers, WLL provides long lasting benefit in the majority of patients. It is considered safe and effective. There are no guidelines standardizing the procedure. Our preferred method is to lavage one lung at a time, with the patient supine, filling to functional residual capacity (FRC) and repeating cycles of drainage and instillation with chest percussion until the effluent is clear. The aim of this article is to provide a detailed description of the technique, equipment needed and logistic considerations as well as providing a physiologic rationale for each step of WLL. We will also review the available data concerning variations of the technique described in the literature.",

      "content": "In 1953, Benjamin Castleman encountered a patient with Periodic Acid Schiff stain (PAS) positive proteinaceous material filling the alveoli at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Over the next 5 years, three centers accumulated 27 cases with similar histopathological findings. This series was reported in the New England Journal as a new disease called pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) (1). As the number of cases recognized increased, the disease was found to be progressive and fatal. Various empirical therapies were proposed. These included antibiotics, corticosteroids and attempts at physical dissolution through administration of potassium iodide, streptokinase, trypsin, heparin and\nacetylcysteine (2,3). In 1963, Dr. Jose Ramirez-Rivera at the Veterans' Administration Hospital in Baltimore tried repeated instillation of normal saline by a transtracheal plastic catheter positioned in one lung at a time in a series of two patients. Aliquots of 100 mL of warmed saline were instilled at a rate of 50-60 drops per minute. This process was repeated four times a day for 2-3 weeks. This technique showed improvement in chest-X-ray, diffusion capacity and histo-pathological findings (4,5). It was a prolonged and distressing procedure. The technique was thought to be imperfect and therefore denounced by many physicians at that time (6). In 1964, Ramirez-Rivera used a double lumen endotracheal tube (DLT) to isolate each lung, instilling up to 3 L saline containing heparin or acetylcysteine (7). This trial provided evidence that such a procedure was safe and feasible. Over the next four decades, the procedure has been",

The main indication for WLL is limitation in daily activities  due  to  dyspnea  (13,15).  Some authors have suggested that patients with PaO 2 of  less than 70 mmHg on room air or an alveolar-arterial [A-a] oxygen gradient of more than 40 mmHg are more likely to progress and hence require WLL (13,16). Current indications vary from one center to another. In one survey of 20 worldwide centers that perform WLL in adults, the most common indications were declining lung function, declining oxygenation and radiographic worsening (17) ( Table 1 ).",

We recommend that bronchoscopy and BAL guidelines be used as a guide for WLL (19). We recommend a platelet count of >50,000, international normalized ratio (INR) of <1.5. Full anticoagulation should be stopped for the procedure. The decision to bridge with heparin depends on the risk of thromboembolic event as appropriate by ACCP guidelines. The procedure should be delayed if the patient has had a bare metal stent or myocardial infarction in the last 6 weeks, or a drug eluting stent in the last 6 months, necessitating the use of clopidogrel or newer antiplatelet agents (20). Aspirin does not need to be held (20). It is worth mentioning that extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) with anticoagulation has been used for severe cases of PAP, without any report of bleeding (16,21-24).",

Lateral decubitus position with the lavaged lung down has been described to help prevent spillage into the contralateral lung (17).\nThe evidence for the benefit from a particular body position during lavage is limited. All of these positions increase the risk of dislodging the double lumen tube. Repositioning the tube is difficult during the lung lavage due to rapid spillage of the volume instilled and frothing which obscures visualization, even with bronchoscopy. Overall, there is little data to routinely recommend any one position other than supine for WLL.",

By ventilating the lung with the better perfusion and optimizing the ventilation and perfusion ratio, single lung ventilation can be tolerated better.",

      "content": "In preparation for the procedure, 3 L bags of normal saline are warmed to 37 ℃ in warming basins (ECOLAB ORS 2000 series irrigation solution warmer, Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA) ( Figure 2 ). Alternatively, blood transfusion warmers can be used to warm the saline (27). A total saline volume of 30-50 Liters should be anticipated.\nA closed system ( Figures 2,3 )  is  created by using a Y connector (we use a high flow irrigating Y-set adapter from\nsmith medical) with tubing that is connected to:\n(I) the ET tube lumen ending in the targeted lung;\n(II) the normal saline bags;\n(III)  a drainage container.\nWe start de-nitrogenating the lung by ventilating with 100% oxygen for 15-20 minutes (the longer duration of  treatment is to compensate for the heterogeneous ventilation in the diseased lung). The remaining oxygen in the target lung following denitrogenation is expected to be consumed at an approximate rate of 125 mL/min (assuming a basal oxygen consumption of 250 mL/min) (28). To prevent barotrauma and bubble formation, the initial aliquot is infused no faster than this rate. Alternatively, some centers achieve degassing of one lung by ventilation with 100% oxygen followed by forced deflation of the lung with negative airway pressure and subsequent airway occlusion that is maintained for 10-15 min up to absorption atelectasis of the whole lung (17).\nThe volume to be infused in the first aliquot is estimated as half of the FRC measured at full body plethysmography before the procedure. The saline is infused under gravity with the bags hanging 50 cm above the mid-axillary line.\nThis sets the maximal hydrostatic pressure that drives the saline into the lung and is the pressure at which the seal of the double lumen tube is confirmed to avoid contamination of the other lung with lavage fluid.\nWarm normal saline is introduced into the target lung through this closed system until the estimated FRC value has been reached. At this point, the lung is completely de-gassed and partially filled with saline.\nAn alternative technique for WLL entails instilling 1L aliquots of saline and draining it without filling the lung up to FRC. Before starting, the lung to be treated is left unventilated for 5 minutes to allow degassing (in this case the absorption of sufficient oxygen to allow for the instillation of the 1 L of saline) (27).",

This force does not exceed the measured height of the saline column of 50 cm. The effluent is allowed to drain via the closed system into a measuring cylinder.\nChest percussion with a wraparound vest is applied for 3-5 minutes, both at maximal volume and during drainage\nin each cycle ( Figure 2 ). The saline is drained to gravity or with active suction back down to FRC. The initial returns are typically milky or turbid. Each cycle takes 3-5 minutes. Cycles can take longer if the patient has concomitant asthma. The process of filling and washing the lungs is continued until the effluent becomes clear. Then the remaining fluid can be drained completely while percussion is being done.\nManual percussion of the chest wall by a physiotherapist can be performed in order to increase clearance of proteinaceous material. Percussion can be administered during both instillation and removal of fluid .The role of manual percussion versus hand-held mechanical percussion device has been investigated. Hammon et al. demonstrated that optical density of recovered lavage fluid was greater from patients who received manual percussion than those who received percussion using hand held mechanical devices or no percussion (29). However, manual percussion results in significant soreness after the procedure. Mechanical percussion with a vest causes less discomfort after the procedure, is better tolerated and is less labor intensive than manual percussion.",

The physiologic alterations during the lavage can be anticipated from the hemodynamic response of the pulmonary circulation to the variations in the airway pressure that occur as the airways are cyclically filled and emptied. The highest oxygen saturation is usually seen at the completion of  the  filling  phase  when the blood is physiologically\nshunted from the non-ventilated to the ventilated lung. Conversely the oxygen level will drop as the lavage lung is emptied (25).\nThe volume of saline infused and recovered should be closely monitored ( Figure 4 ).  Large losses of fluid can indicate leakage into the contralateral lung or the pleural space. Leakage into the contralateral lung is usually recognized by observing lavage fluid in the endotracheal\ntube of the ventilated lung. This can be fixed by adjustment of the bronchial balloon cuff pressure or by repositioning the double lumen ET tube. Bronchoscopic examination to confirm and adjust the position of the ET tube may be needed. Leakage into the ipsilateral pleural space can be detected by performing a bedside ultrasound examination.\nThe total volumes of saline required can be up to 40 L. In a survey of 20 centers performing WLL, the average total volume used was 15.4±6.8 L per lung (17). Adjusted for body weight, a total volume of 250 mL/kg can be used on average in adults and children (30).",

When the effluent is clear from one lung, it is drained completely. Then dual lung ventilation is started. Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) and diuretics are used to help re-inflate the lavaged lung. This can take up to an hour. Once the patient is able to tolerate single lung ventilation on the lavaged lung, the other lung is lavaged using the same 1 L aliquots as described. After the procedure is completed, the DLT is switched to a single lumen endotracheal tube.

The most common reported complications were fever, which occurred in 18% followed by hypoxemia (14%), wheezing (6%), pneumonia (5%) and fluid leakage (4%). Pleural effusion and pneumothorax occurred in 3.1% and 0. 8% respectively .  No patient needed prolonged mechanical ventilation (17). Cardiac arrest was reported to occur in one case (17). One case of death related to WLL has been reported as well (32). It is likely that mortality is under reported.\nThe major side effect from WLL is hypoxemia which can be improved by ventilation with high inspired oxygen concentration (33,34). As previously discussed, during the filling phase, arterial oxygenation improves due to increase in airway pressure and redirection of blood to the contralateral ventilated lung (13,20). Emptying of the lung causes a decrease in airway pressure and perfusion of the lung undergoing treatment resulting in a fall in PaO 2 (13). Excessive PEEP in the ventilated lung should be avoided , as this may shunt the blood away to the non-ventilated lung leading to ventilation/perfusion mismatch and worsening\noxygenation (35).\nMal-positioning of the double lumen endobronchial tube with spillage of lavage fluid into the ventilated lung can occur (13). Barotrauma related to rapid instillation of large volumes of fluid can result in hydro-pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema and pleural fluid collections (33,36). Large pleural effusion at the end of the procedure can be drained with thoracentesis to aid in extubation.\nHypothermia can occur and is minimized by close monitoring of patient's body temperature, keeping the body warm using heating pads and using saline warmed to body temperature.",

In one study, the median symptom free time after first WLL was 3 years, with 70% of patients followed beyond 3 years remaining free of recurrent PAP symptoms (14). In another report a much shorter median duration of benefit of 15 months was reported, after which patients required a repeat lavage (5).\nClinically,  WLL  has  been  associated  with  an improvement in dyspnea (14). There is also an improvement in objective parameters. A report of 47 patients with paired pre-lavage and post-lavage data demonstrate that there was significant improvement in PaO2, [A-a] gradient, FEV1 ,  vital  capacity and DLCO (34). More recently, a study assessing the long-term effect of WLL reported an immediate improvement in FVC, with the effect persisting up to 1-year after the procedure (14).
