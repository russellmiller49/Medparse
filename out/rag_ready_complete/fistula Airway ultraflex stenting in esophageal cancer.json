Because most\ncontinuous variables were skewed, nonparametric approaches are used in the study. Quantitative variables between 2 groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables and the x 2 test for nominal variables. The factors that impacted 90-day mortality were entered into a multinominal logistic regression analysis to identify the net effects of each individual factor. The 90-day mortality was the single-dependent variable. Adjusted odds ratios (Odds ratio (OR)) and their 95% con /uniFB01 dence intervals (CI) were computed by logistic regression model analysis to clarify the impact of several potentially independent factors by controlling for age and gender. The level of statistical signi /uniFB01 cance was set at P , 0.05. Survival days and rate were compared with 2 subgroups with or without SEMS placement. Survival curves were traced using the Kaplan-Meier method, and survival curves were compared using the log-rank test. All analyses were conducted using SPSS software (version 10.0, SPSS, Chicago, IL) and Prism 4 for Windows (version 4.03, Graphpad Software Inc., San Diego, CA).\nRESULTS\nFrom August 2001 to March 2007, 817 consecutive patients with esophageal cancer received bronchoscopy for routine airway evaluation when esophageal cancer was diagnosed. Fifty-nine patients with ERF found during bronchoscopy and con /uniFB01 rmed by esophagograhy were included in this study. The demography of these subjects with (n 5 31) and without (n 5 28) airway SEMS placement was listed in Table 1. The demography including age [median (IQR), 56 years (44 -66 years) versus 52 years (48-57 years); P 5 0.82], gender (male, 30 versus 28; P 5 0.34), performance status (number of patients with performance status less than 2, 5 versus 5; P 5 0.86), site of /uniFB01 stula (trachea, 15 versus 14; P 5 0.9; main carina, 0 versus 2; P 5 0.13; left main bronchus, 10 versus 9; P 5 0.99; right main bronchus, 6 versus 3; P 5 0.36), staging (stage III, 22 versus 19; P 5 0.8) and previous treatment [no treatment, 7 versus 5; P 5 0.65; concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT), 18 versus 12; P 5 0.24; chemotherapy, 3 versus 4; P 5 0.58; CCRT and surgery, 2 versus 5; P 5 0.18; CCRT, surgery and chemotherapy, 1 versus 2; P 5 0.49] of esophageal cancer when ERF diagnosed was similar in both groups (Table 1).\nClinical manifestations of these patients with and without SEMS placement was listed in Table 2. The manifestations between patients with and without SEMS including dyspnea [n, 12 (38.7%) versus 9 (32.1%); P 5 0.6], chronic cough [n, 11 (35.5%) versus 14 (50%); P 5 0.26], hemoptysis [n, 3 (9.7%) versus 2 (7.1%); P 5 0.73] and respiratory failure [n, 5 (16.1%) versus 3 (10.8%); P 5 0.54] were without signi /uniFB01 cant differences.\nThe median survival period of the 59 patients from the /uniFB01 rst time of ERF diagnosed was 30 days (IQR, 15 -103 days). In patients with an implanted SEMS, the median survival period was 69 days (IQR, 16 -120 days), and in patients who were treated without SEMS, it was 21 days (IQR, 6 -73 days). The differences between the groups with and without SEMS implanted were signi /uniFB01 cant. The proportion of patients surviving with and without SEMS were traced after ERF diagnosed with the Kaplan-Meier method (31% versus 25%; log-rank test, P 5 0.04; hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.31 -0.99) in Figure 1.\nThe variables including performance status improvement, received further treatment after ERF diagnosis, previous treatment when ERF diagnosis, stage IV of esophageal cancer when ERF diagnosis, ERF location, prolonged pneumonia and 90-day survival were analyzed with Fisher ' s test (Table 3).\nPerformance status improvement, received further treatment after ERF diagnosis and prolonged pneumonia with signi /uniFB01 cant differences between case and control were further analyzed by multiple logistic regression analysis controlling for age and gender.

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "content": "Previous studies have shown that patients with direct airway invasion by esophageal cancer have a poor prognosis. 1 -3 However, there are a few reports 9,10 that describe the airway stents in patients with ERF caused by esophageal cancer. Despite their poor prognosis, we have shown in this study that airway Ultra /uniFB02 ex stent placement in these subjects is feasible with a /uniFB02 exible bronchoscope.\nWe report here 59 attempts of esophageal cancer involving the airway in patients with ERF. Bronchoscopic airway stenting without /uniFB02 uoroscopic guidance was successfully performed in 31 patients and no patients failed stenting. Those with SEMS placement had better survival than those without airway SEMS placement, and the possible reasons included improved performance status and received further treatment after SEMS placement. However, conducting this study, we emphasized the potential value of a therapeutic airway stenting for these advanced esophageal cancer. Although airway stent ' s usefulness has been published a decade ago in those with advanced end-stage esophageal cancer with airway involvement, ERF is still a challenging condition for physicians. There are no current guidelines for airway stent procedures advising for /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopy before stent insertion. Recurrent aspiration pneumonia may be induced during airway invasion by esophageal cancer in these patients with ERF, which therefore suggests poor prognosis. However, we think the effects of the airway stenting by /uniFB01 ber-optic bronchoscopy such as in our study subjects are so positive that considering stenting should be mandatory to improve the possibilities for patients ' outcomes.\nThis alternative method of airway Ultra /uniFB02 ex stenting, using /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopy without /uniFB02 uoroscopic guidance, was successful in all patients in our study. The mean time required for stent placement was 16.7 minutes (range, 11.6 -27.9 minutes). Despite there were appropriate factors to impact survival after airway stenting in our study, prolonged pneumonia remained to worsen survival even in successful airway stenting. However, no life-threatening complications developed as a result of this procedure. The use of the present technique also provides broader accessibility for patients unsuitable for surgery and would be a viable alternative when surgical or /uniFB02 uoroscopic equipment is not available. The most important is\nERF, esophagorespiratory /uniFB01 stula; IQR, interquartile range; CCRT, concurrent chemoradiotherapy.\nthat the patients had better survival when their performance status improved and they could receive further management such as chemotherapy.\nThe use of silicone stents versus SEMS, stent placement by /uniFB01 ber-optic bronchoscopy versus rigid bronchoscopy, airway versus esophageal stents or whether to use double stenting in both the esophagus and airway remain controversial, however. 7,17 Rigid bronchoscopy under general anesthesia and /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopy under /uniFB02 uoroscopic guidance are the most common methods of stent implantation in mechanically ventilated patients. Despite this, some patients are not suitable for this kind of surgical intervention because of the severity of their illness, comorbidities or a simple refusal to undergo surgery. In addition, /uniFB02 uoroscopy requires special facilities that may not be available in every intensive care unit. However, esophageal stent was used to improve swallowing due to esophageal obstruction. Few stents placed in esophageal cancer for respiratory symptoms, except those dif /uniFB01 cult to approach by airway stents such as ERF were located at main carina.\nThere were 2 patients with carina ERF receiving airway stents in current study. However, incomplete closure and leakage were found in the 2 patients. Y stent is suggested for carina ERF. Usually, the patients were referred to surgeon for surgical treatment. However, the 2 patients in our current study refused general anesthesia and surgery. Carinal ERF was found in patients with benign diseases such as traumatic injury in our hospital. Surgical treatment such as repair or Y-stent insertion is the /uniFB01 rst choice in our hospital. The current study included patients before 2007 and therefore metallic Y stent had not yet been available at our hospital at that time. However, management of carina ERF due to esophageal cancer remains challenging. The life quality and survival are dif /uniFB01 cult to improve under current treatment. The treatment is also limited by facilities and techniques are available.\nPaganin et al. 17 reported double stents (both airway and esophageal) insertion in ERF may increase the ef /uniFB01 ciency of ERF closure in 2008. However, all included patients in our study were before 2007 and experienced respiratory symptoms (Table 2), which caused airway SEMS indicated. Esophageal\nstent in our hospital is indicated in gastrointestinal tract symptoms/signs due to esophageal obstruction. However, esophageal stents may cause respiratory symptoms with airway compression. Also, these patients with ERF had advanced stage cancer. Therefore, they usually had received nasoduodenal tube or jejunostomy feeding in our hospital. However, there was limited experience with esophageal stent or double stent insertion in esophageal cancer with ERF in our hospital before 2007. The current data could not conclude the effect of esophageal stent or double stent insertion, but we agreed Paganin ' s opinion by their report. 17\nOur study has limitations. First, we did not perform a prospective controlled study for airway stents. However, we did not /uniFB01 nd any obvious diversity signifying that airway stenting did not worsen the survival. Blinded, randomized and controlled trials are hard to perform in these subjects due to the practices. Second, quality of life of these patients was not recorded but only performance status. However, SEMS placement improved most respiratory symptoms and signs in this study; hence, further treatment was possible. There may be bias among 28 patients without SEMS placement for the retrospective character such as it is possible that these 28 patients were not properly evaluated; the ERF may be therefore misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed. Meanwhile, care of these patients also depends on facilities, physicians experience and skills. However, the demography between patients with and without SEMS has been well compared in Table 1. The age, gender, performance status, stage, sites of ERF and previous treatment were not signi /uniFB01 cantly different between the groups! We emphasized that the conditions between the 2 groups were similar. Finally, factors that impacted survival may be complex to analyze, despite our study revealed the better outcome by SEMS placement.\nIn conclusion, the current study described that airway stenting in ERF patients caused by esophageal cancer improved survival than those without stenting. Surgical treatment remains the /uniFB01 rst choice in these patients; however, we provided an alternative management for the patients whom surgery is unsuitable. Performance status improvement after stenting and further treatment for esophageal cancer may improve survival and prolonged pneumonia may worsen survival.\nValues are expressed as n (%) or range.\na Adjusted by age and gender in multinominal logistic regression analysis.\nERF, esophagorespiratory /uniFB01 stula; SEMS, self-expandable metallic stent.",
