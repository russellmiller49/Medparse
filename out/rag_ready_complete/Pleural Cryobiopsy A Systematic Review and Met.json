Percutaneously, it can be performed either via closed pleural biopsy (using an Abrams or Cope needle) or under real-time ultrasound guidance such as with an Achieve needle (Merit Medical Systems). 3,4 Alternatively, pleural tissue can be endoscopically visualized and sampled using either medical pleuroscopy (MP) or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). 5 MP and VATS are overlapping procedures that essentially involve the creation of one or more chest wall entry ports, thereby permitting ipsilateral lung collapse and pleural /uniFB02 uid evacuation to enable pleural cavity visualization through a camera lens and simultaneous tissue sampling. Endoscopic pleural tissue sampling is typically accomplished using rigid or /uniFB02 exible forceps; rigid forceps are used in conjunction with standard rigid thoracoscopic instruments used for VATS that may also be used for MP, whereas /uniFB02 exible forceps are passed through the working channel of a semi-rigid thoracoscope with a /uniFB02 exible distal tip resembling that of a /uniFB02 exible video bronchoscope that is frequently (but not exclusively) used for MP. 6 Endoscopic pleural biopsy (via MP or VATS) has the highest diagnostic yield\namong all available sampling modalities, with estimates approximating 90% when pooled from multiple studies. 7\nWhy is there an imperfect rate of successful diagnosis despite pleural sampling under direct endoscopic vision, and how could this yield be improved on? It is theoretically conceivable that increasing the biopsy specimen size, particularly taking a more invasive biopsy that also involves deeper layers of tissue and/or avoiding the potential for crush artifact associated with forceps biopsies could potentially improve diagnostic yield. Pleural cryobiopsy promises all of these things.\nCryobiopsy during MP/VATS involves freezing a piece of pleural tissue and removing it en bloc instead of taking a bite of tissue using forceps. 8,9 This enables acquisition of larger -and possibly better preserved -pieces of pleural tissue. 9-11 However, its impact on diagnostic performance remains uncertain, with various studies showing inconsistent trends when compared with standard forceps biopsies. 8-15 Furthermore, there is at least a theoretical safety concern related to the use of cryobiopsy; borrowing from transbronchial cryobiopsy data, the potential association of pleural cryobiopsy with increased bleeding is a valid question that warrants careful investigation. 16-18 We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies published to date to investigate the diagnostic and safety pro /uniFB01 le of pleural cryobiopsy compared with forceps-based pleural biopsy.",

We applied these search terms to titles and abstracts. The bibliographies of shortlisted articles were also reviewed to identify any additional relevant studies. Conference abstract books were searched for additional studies that may have been presented but not yet published as manuscripts. We reviewed full texts of all shortlisted studies to identify all studies that met our Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, Study Type criteria: patients included adult humans undergoing pleural biopsy via MP or VATS, intervention included cryobiopsy of the pleura, control included forceps biopsy of the pleura, outcome included overall diagnostic yield, and study type included observational or experimental.\nOur exclusion criteria were the following: case reports or series with fewer than /uniFB01 ve subjects, nonstandardized procedures, studies with overlapping datasets, and review papers.\nAs previously indicated, the primary outcome of interest was overall diagnostic yield. This included malignant cases and nonmalignant cases, such as infection or nonspeci /uniFB01 c pleuritis. Of note, prolonged\npostprocedural follow-up would be required in the case of nonspeci /uniFB01 c pleuritis to account for the possibility of a false-negative biopsy result and the later discovery of a malignant process, as described in previous literature. 20\nTwo authors (M. S. and J. S.) used the Quality Assessment, Data Abstraction and Synthesis-2 tool to assess the quality of included studies. 21 The two authors independently scored each study across the following four domains: patient selection, index test, reference standard, and /uniFB02 ow and timing. Within each domain, the risk of bias for each included study was rated as low, high, or unclear. The /uniFB01 rst three domains were also scored for applicability (or lack thereof). Interrater agreement was calculated using Cohen kappa statistic.\nMeta-analysis of the diagnostic yield estimations was performed using RevMan software version 5.3 (The Cochrane Collaboration). We used inverse variance weighting to aggregate diagnostic yield proportions across studies and to enable calculation of a pooled OR. Study heterogeneity was measured using the I 2 index, with a plan to use the /uniFB01 xed effects model if the I 2 index was < 40% and the random effects model otherwise. We also generated a funnel plot to assess for publication bias.\nBecause the study involved secondary analysis of aggregated data from previously published sources, institutional review board approval was not required.",

Out of these, 24 studies (12 published studies and 12 abstracts) were selected for detailed review. Where needed, we reached out to corresponding authors of the publications to try and obtain additional data. Seventeen out of these ( /uniFB01 ve published studies and 12 abstracts) were ultimately excluded. Among these, six studies had overlapping study populations with one or more of the included studies and were therefore excluded to prevent duplication of patients. Eight studies were excluded because of lack of pertinent or adequate data.\nA total of seven observational studies representing 586 biopsies (311 cryobiopsies and 275 /uniFB02 exible forceps biopsies) were analyzed. 9-15 Our assessment of study quality is available in e-Appendix 1. In most instances, the risk of bias was assessed to be low or unclear. The Cohen kappa statistic for interrater agreement in assessing study quality was 88%.\nTable 1 illustrates salient features and summary data from the included studies, whereas Table 2 lists the materials and procedural techniques used in each study. Pleural biopsy was performed for diagnostic evaluation of an unexplained pleural effusion in all studies, except\nthat 10% of the patients reported by Chen et al 15 underwent pleural biopsy for purposes of ancillary testing in the setting of known metastatic non-small cell lung cancer and one patient in the Thomas et al cohort 11 had pleural thickening without pleural effusion. All studies used both cryobiopsies and /uniFB02 exible forceps biopsies, whereas all but one study used a semi-rigid thoracoscope. Wurps et al 12 used a rigid thoracoscope instead, and sequentially used rigid forceps (four samples), /uniFB02 exible forceps (one to two samples), and the cryoprobe (one to two samples); only the latter two techniques were included in our analysis for purposes of consistency. In all studies except one, both cryobiopsy and /uniFB02 exible biopsy were performed on the same patient; in Tousheed et al, 14 the /uniFB01 rst 52 consecutive patients underwent only /uniFB02 exible forceps biopsy because of unavailability of cryobiopsy equipment and the /uniFB01 nal 87 consecutive patients underwent only cryobiopsy with no change in the procedural indication.\nStudies used a variable length of postprocedural followup for nonmalignant biopsy results; where reported, this ranged from 6 to 12 months (Table 1).\nMeta-analysis yielded a pooled diagnostic yield of 96.5% for cryobiopsies and 93.1% for /uniFB02 exible forceps biopsies with an inverse variance-weighted Odds ratio (OR) of 1.61 (95% CI, 0.71-3.66) and an I 2 (heterogeneity index) of",

      "content": "Our systematic review and meta-analysis of published observational data to date showed that pleural cryobiopsy is safe and consistently yielded larger tissue specimens than /uniFB02 exible forceps biopsy. However, cryobiopsy is not associated with a statistically signi /uniFB01 cant improvement in diagnostic yield. These\n/uniFB01 ndings are based on a review of seven observational studies with relatively low heterogeneity and a low to indeterminate overall risk of bias.\nTo our knowledge, this is the /uniFB01 rst systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating pleural cryobiopsy as a diagnostic tool. Given the growing interest in use of cryotechnology across areas relevant to interventional pulmonology and thoracic surgery, and given the current absence of multicenter randomized trial data on this subject, this study is both timely and crucial in advancing our understanding of the role of cryobiopsy in pleural tissue sampling. 6,7,22\nThe ability of cryobiopsy to yield comparatively larger tissue specimens is intuitively obvious. The /uniFB02 exible forceps have fairly limited jaw opening (available sizes include 2.0 and 2.8 mm) and can therefore only be expected to provide modest biopsy sizes. The adherent and activated cryoprobe, on the other hand, can tear off large pieces of tissue when it is pulled off of the surface of the pleura. Furthermore, this mechanism also results\na In this study, four rigid forceps biopsies were also obtained per patient.\nin fewer instances of crush artifact than forceps biopsy. 10,11,15 Nonetheless, available data does not demonstrate a statistically signi /uniFB01 cant improvement in diagnostic yield with the use of cryobiopsy.\nA few caveats need to be borne in mind before generalizing these /uniFB01 ndings. First and foremost, our /uniFB01 ndings are limited by the observational nature of included studies. Second, the number and size of available studies on this subject is relatively limited, thereby limiting the statistical power of our analyses (number of subjects undergoing cryobiopsy: 311; number of subjects undergoing /uniFB02 exible forceps biopsy: 275). One of the problems with pleural cryobiopsy is that there is no\nstandardized methodology to perform it. Table 2 illustrates some of the variations in materials and methods used across individual studies, including cryoprobe size and freezing time. Similarly, there are considerable variations in the practice of /uniFB02 exible forceps biopsy, such as using 2.0- vs 2.8-mm forceps, using serrated vs cupped vs spiked forceps, using a peeling vs nonpeeling biopsy technique, and going back to the same biopsy site for additional biopsies or not. Whether or not these factors impact diagnostic yield remains to be studied.\nImportantly, our analysis only compares cryobiopsy with /uniFB02 exible forceps biopsy and not with rigid forceps biopsy. Previously published studies comparing rigid vs /uniFB02 exible forceps point to similar diagnostic yields from the two techniques, with the possible exception of rigid thoracoscopic biopsy being superior in cases requiring simultaneous lysis of adhesions. 23-25 Using a rigid thoracoscope can also be considered advantageous from the point of view of being potentially more freely available in resource-limited settings, being a cheaper alternative to the semi-rigid thoracoscope, and being less prone to damage. Cryobiopsy, which can also be performed using the rigid thoracoscope, can potentially retain these advantages independently of its promise as a diagnostic tool. The only study that compared rigid forceps biopsy with cryobiopsy showed that rigid forceps biopsy was superior to cryobiopsy, whereas there was no signi /uniFB01 cant difference between /uniFB02 exible forceps biopsy and\nNR ¼ not reported.\na P value for comparison with /uniFB02 exible forceps biopsy < .05.\nb Authors reported that there was no morbidity or mortality among these groups of patients.\ncryobiopsy. 12 Why would this be the case? It is conceivable that the 3-mm rigid forceps bite off larger pieces of tissue and cause less tissue shearing than the smaller-sized /uniFB02 exible forceps. It is also conceivable that rigid forceps preserve the tissue architecture better than cryobiopsy ' s freeze-thaw treatment -even though freeze artifacts were not reported in the study. However, we recommend against drawing de /uniFB01 nitive conclusions from this single-center observational study that compared four rigid biopsies per patient with one to two cryobiopsies per patient (Table 2). A multicenter, randomized study is needed for further investigation.\nCould it be that cryobiopsy has a role to play in only certain subsets of patients? For example, none of the studies included in our analysis differentially analyzed cryobiopsy of an endoscopically visualized pleural nodule as opposed to the parietal pleura itself. It is not inconceivable that the yield of cryobiopsy might be different based on the speci /uniFB01 c /uniFB01 ndings visualized during thoracoscopy. It is generally understood that there is a distinct need for sampling deeper layers of tissue (including adjoining adipose tissue) to optimize diagnostic yield for malignant mesothelioma; therefore, cryobiopsy could well be a potentially superior strategy in settings with higher prevalence of asbestos-related pleural disease. 10,26,27 Another question relevant to the current era of ancillary testing for malignancies would be whether cryobiopsy improves the rate of acquiring suf /uniFB01 cient tissue to permit all ancillary testing (eg, immunohistochemical staining for programmed death-ligand 1 expression, genetic testing for driver oncogenes). Whether cryobiopsy has a role in that setting also remains to be systematically investigated.\nIn addition to a lack of obvious diagnostic superiority, widespread enthusiasm for pleural cryobiopsy is likely also hindered by the theoretical risk of increased complications, particularly major bleeding.\nComparatively higher bleeding rates have been demonstrated in multiple studies involving transbronchial cryobiopsy of the lung, making this a valid concern. 16-18 Theoretically, it makes sense that an abrupt detachment of the cryoprobe and adjoining frozen pleura could shear pleural tissue and adjacent blood vessels in unpredictable ways and increase the prospects of a major bleeding secondary to vessel rupture. On the other hand, forceps biopsy may theoretically offer a more precise application of injury to the pleural tissue that the operator could direct away from intercostal vessels using their anatomic knowledge and visual-spatial awareness. In this review of 311 cryobiopsy procedures, major bleeding was not reported in even one instance; however, studies did not uniformly identify what would and would not have constituted as such. What also limits the interpretability of these data is the lack of a uniform freezing time across studies, which would correlate with the depth of biopsy and therefore the extent of cryobiopsy ' s impact on tissue structures (Table 2). Furthermore, several of the analyzed studies were retrospective in nature, making it less likely that all bleeding episodes were reliably captured. Until more rigorous data on this subject become available, this question cannot be deemed to have been de /uniFB01 nitively addressed.\nIn summary, based on analysis of all available published data, pleural cryobiopsy appears safe but does not appear to increase diagnostic yield over /uniFB02 exible forceps biopsy under thoracoscopic visualization. Nonetheless, it does appear to be a promising tool with a potential to increase diagnostic yield, tissue suf /uniFB01 ciency, or both -at least in a subset of patients depending on risk factors and/or endoscopic /uniFB01 ndings. Rigid forceps biopsy as a third alternative may potentially hold promise too, based on results from a single-center study. Adequately powered, multicenter, randomized trials are needed for further investigation.",
