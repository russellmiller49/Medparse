In addition, talc pleurodesis is largely unsuccessful in this population. 8-10 Therefore, patients with refractory HH suffer through multiple hospital visits for symptom management with repeated thoracenteses. Although advances in pleural effusion treatment have led to a relatively widespread use of the indwelling tunneled pleural catheter (IPC) as a tool for management of\nmalignant pleural effusions (MPEs), 11-13 palliation in the setting of HH remains limited.\nAlthough primarily used in the management of MPE, a growing body of literature suggests the utility and safety of IPCs in benign pleural effusions. 13-15 Patients with HH are relatively immunocompromised and have decreased coagulation factor synthesis and function, bone marrow suppression, and thrombocytopenia, suggesting they are at higher risk of infectious and bleeding complications after IPC placement. The existing literature on IPCs in HH includes small, singlecenter studies, and the safety of IPC use in HH remains imprecisely de /uniFB01 ned. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics, safety, and outcomes of patients with HH who undergo IPC placement.",

Records were reviewed for patient demographics, hepatology and operative reports, pathology, cytology, microbiology, and laboratory values at time of IPC insertion.\nPatient records were subsequently reviewed for evidence of complications, pleural infection by queries regarding post-IPC placement pleural /uniFB02 uid cultures, clinic visits, hospital admissions, and/or death records. Radiologic and operative records were examined regarding pleural space physiology at the time of IPC insertion to document evidence of expandable or trapped lung. The following complications were collected: IPC-related pleural infection de /uniFB01 ned by the presence of pleural pus, positive pleural /uniFB02 uid Gram stain/culture requiring subsequent intervention (antibiotics, IPC removal, etc), cellulitis requiring systemic antibiotics, evidence of renal failure and electrolyte imbalance based on physician ' s clinical judgment, catheter malfunction, leakage of /uniFB02 uid at the site of catheter insertion, malnutrition de /uniFB01 ned by reduced muscle mass and strength based on physician ' s clinical judgment, and subcutaneous /uniFB02 uid collection (seroma).\nData regarding IPC removal, timing, and reason for removal were collected. In patients dying with the IPC in situ, the date of death was considered as the date of catheter removal.\nIf the date of death or catheter removal was not available, to calculate days of IPC use, data were censored on the date that records were received from the participating institution. Data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic database tools hosted at Virginia Commonwealth University Health System.\nDate of diagnosis of HH was the time of clinical diagnosis per a clinician in the corresponding center, based on the presence of effusion seen for the /uniFB01 rst time on chest imaging along with pleural /uniFB02 uid analysis. Time from diagnosis to the study end date in the participating center or time to death was used to estimate survival after HH was diagnosed.\nCritical Care Medicine (Dr Akulian), University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC; the Division of Allergy, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (Dr Maldonado), Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN; the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (Dr Lee), Johns Hopkins Medical Center, Baltimore, MD; the Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology (Dr Stravitz), and Department of Biostatistics (Dr Kang), Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center, Richmond, VA; and the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (Dr Chen), Washington University in St Louis, St Louis, MO.

      "title": "Discussion",
      "content": "We present, to our knowledge, the /uniFB01 rst and only multicenter study to examine clinical outcomes related to the placement of IPC for refractory HH in patients with underlying cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease.\nThe median time to IPC removal within the cohort was 156 days; however, in patients achieving spontaneous pleurodesis, the median time to removal was 55 days. Although the spontaneous pleurodesis rate in our cohort is lower than that seen in the setting of MPE, it is important to note that despite large-volume effusions, 28% of patients with HH and IPC achieved this desirable outcome, whereas the reminder of the cohort had an acceptable complication rate and similar or more favorable survival compared with data published in existing literature. 1\nA 10% overall infection rate and 2.5% mortality rate because of IPC-related empyema and sepsis were\nidenti /uniFB01 ed within this cohort. When compared with the largest study of chest tubes in the management of HH, 8 our complication rates are signi /uniFB01 cantly lower than traditional chest tubes. In a study of 59 patients with cirrhosis and HH by Liu et al, 8 pleural space infection was reported in 48% of patients. Eighty percent of the patients suffered from infection, renal failure, or electrolyte imbalance after chest tube placement and continuous drainage. Ultimately, 27% of these patients died, with infection being the most common cause of death. Although it is not possible to prove causality with a retrospective study design, we attribute the cause of low renal failure and electrolyte imbalance in our cohort to a regimented /uniFB02 uid drainage schedule of no more than 1 L on an every other day basis. The purpose of /uniFB02 uid drainage in our patient population was symptom improvement and not maximal drainage.\nRefractory HH often requires repeat thoracentesis, which carries a higher complication rate in this population. 16 TIPS has been used in the management of refractory HH in appropriate candidates; however, complete response is reported in 55% of patients. The reminder of patients will continue to require repeat thoracentesis for palliation or until liver transplant becomes an option. 17 The aforementioned challenges call for evaluation of other management strategies, such as IPC use, and emphasize the importance of this study and future prospective trials.\n]\nPrevious literature on IPCs is primarily focused on patients with MPE, where infection remains a common complication of IPC placement with reported rates of 4% to 25%. 11,12,18,19 Most prior studies of IPCs in HH are limited to case reports and case series or have involved patients with non-MPE of different etiologies, confusing the interpretation of risk estimates for speci /uniFB01 c patient groups because of disease heterogeneity. 20,21 In a single-center retrospective study of 62 patients with HH, IPCrelated pleural space infection was reported in 16% of the patients, but other common complications of conventional chest tubes such as renal failure and electrolyte imbalance were not assessed. 22 In contrast, our study represents a population of patients with HH managed by IPCs across eight different institutions and provides additional external validity, despite unmeasured variations among centers. Additionally, this study provides a detailed outline of minor and major complications and is the only study reporting on the effect of IPC drainage on renal function and electrolyte imbalance. Furthermore, we assess for predictors of pleurodesis and death after IPC placement, and report on IPC removal rate with relation to other competing risks of catheter removal and survival data after the diagnosis of HH.\nTo date, no literature on quality of life and palliation assessment is reported in patients with HH. IPCs are used as a palliative mode of therapy in managing large pleural effusions, but because of the lack of clear guidelines regarding IPCs in HH, there seems to be a selection and referral bias in our cohort. Although most institutions reported similar audit times, the number of patients undergoing IPC placement varied signi /uniFB01 cantly among centers (3-25 patients). The lack of published randomized controlled trials in the management of refractory HH compounds the complex decision-making process of a multidisciplinary liver transplant team providing care to this patient population. Therefore, the management of refractory HH at this point is primarily provider and institution dependent. This study, and future studies in this area, can help providers of a multidisciplinary team to manage patients with HH-complicated cirrhosis.\nThere are several limitations in the current study. Because of its retrospective nature, this study has the\ncommon disadvantages inherent in such a study design. Particularly, lack of long-term follow-up data may affect the estimates of successful catheter removal. No speci /uniFB01 c predictors of spontaneous pleurodesis were identi /uniFB01 ed on univariate analysis. This may be secondary to an overall small number of patients and low power. Additionally, in 11 of 22 patients with spontaneous pleurodesis, IPC was placed as a bridge to transplant. Most patients who received liver transplant underwent IPC removal after successful transplant. It is possible that other factors such as resolution of portal hypertension and cessation of /uniFB02 uid accumulation are the cause of catheter removal in these patients. This speculation cannot be proven in this retrospective study because ultrasound examination of the pleura prior to IPC removal is not available. This may result in in /uniFB02 ation of the true spontaneous pleurodesis rate.\nThe participating institutions in this study are tertiary care hospitals, academic institutions, and referral centers for complex diseases. These institutions may care for patients that do not represent the general population. To better understand our patient population, we estimated patient survival from the time of HH diagnosis and demonstrated that median survival in our population was 368 days among the nontransplant candidates. In a retrospective analysis, Badillo and Rockey 1 showed a mean survival /C6 SD of 321 /C6 463 days in 64 patients receiving medical therapy de /uniFB01 ned by diuresis and repeat thoracentesis. In their study, patients with liver transplant (n ¼ 5) had a higher survival rate as also noted in our population. Although the patients in the Badillo and Rockey study 1 did not undergo IPC placement, this study indicates the overall low survival rate in HH as noted in our cohort.\nIn our study, the role of albumin replacement after IPC drainage was not evaluated. Albumin replacement, after large-volume paracentesis in patients with HH, is shown to reduce paracentesisinduced circulatory dysfunction. 23 Currently, there are no guidelines regarding albumin supplementation with pleural /uniFB02 uid drainage, and its use is largely provider and patient dependent. The result of this study is re /uniFB02 ective of real-world practice in the absence of evidence or guidelines. Future trials should evaluate the utility of albumin replacement in pleural /uniFB02 uid drainage using IPCs.\nAdditionally, we were unable to account for selection bias in our study. Data regarding the number of patients\nwho were not referred or refused to undergo IPC placement were not available. Moreover, provider and institution bias could play a role. Exclusion of these potential IPC candidates could arti /uniFB01 cially lower our complication rate.\nFinally, our study lacks a control group, and other, perhaps more relevant, end points such as symptomatic relief and quality of life assessment were not measured in this study.\nProspective randomized trials are needed to fully evaluate safety and assess quality of life, using IPCs compared with other HH management modalities. Patient-centric outcomes such as mean daily dyspnea and discomfort, mean days spent in the hospital, and overall quality of life measures using standard\nmeasurement techniques should be the focus of future studies.",
