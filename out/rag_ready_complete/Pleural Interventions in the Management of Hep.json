Gorden, MD, FCCP\nHepatic hydrothorax can be present in 5% to 15% of patients with underlying cirrhosis and portal hypertension, often re /uniFB02 ecting advanced liver disease. Its impact can be variable, because patients may have small pleural effusions and minimal pulmonary symptoms or massive pleural effusions and respiratory failure. Management of hepatic hydrothorax can be dif /uniFB01 cult because these patients often have a number of comorbidities and potential for complications.\nMinimal high-quality data are available for guidance speci /uniFB01 cally related to hepatic hydrothorax, potentially resulting in pulmonary or critical care physician struggling for best management options. We therefore provide a Case-based presentation with management options based on currently available data and opinion. We discuss the role of pleural interventions, including thoracentesis, tube thoracostomy, indwelling tunneled pleural catheter, pleurodesis, and surgical interventions.\nIn general, we recommend that management be conducted within a multidisciplinary team including pulmonology, hepatology, and transplant surgery. Patients with refractory hepatic hydrothorax that are not transplant candidates should be managed with palliative intent; we suggest indwelling tunneled pleural catheter placement unless otherwise contraindicated. For patients with unclear or incomplete hepatology treatment plans or those unable to undergo more de /uniFB01 nitive procedures, we recommend serial thoracentesis.

Once a decision is made to drain HH, multiple options for management exist, similar to other pleural effusions.\nCase Example: A 47-year-old male is transferred from an outside facility for hepatology evaluation with a history of cirrhosis and pleural effusion. He was admitted with encephalopathy and dyspnea. Imaging reveals the presence of a large right pleural effusion.\nQuestion: What are the best management options and available supporting data for the pulmonary or critical care physician in the management of HH?",

      "content": "The initial evaluation of a patient with this history would be to con /uniFB01 rm HH, ruling out other pathologic conditions (eg, infection, malignancy) that would require different treatment. The diagnosis, initial evaluation, and pathophysiology of HH is beyond the scope of this article and is well covered in multiple reviews. 4,5,7,9,10 HH is diagnosed by a transudative pleural effusion after other cardiopulmonary pathologic conditions have been ruled out in the setting of liver disease. The pathophysiology of HH is related to liver failure and sodium/water imbalance. As with many problems in medicine, addressing the underlying problem is advised; therefore, optimization of these issues with sodium restriction and diuretics is recommended as /uniFB01 rst-line therapy. 4,5,8 Depending on local resources, referral to hepatology or liver transplant team(s) is also advised. 4\nInitial workup should be directed toward the cause of this patient ' s current clinical problems, including evaluation of encephalopathy and dyspnea. In light of worsening dyspnea and effusion, we would perform thoracentesis. Pleural drainage via thoracentesis would\nbe reasonable because it may offer both diagnostic and therapeutic bene /uniFB01 ts. Ruling out bleeding (hemothorax), infection (empyema, spontaneous bacterial empyema), and malignancy in the pleural space are helpful in narrowing the differential diagnosis for his decompensation and allow con /uniFB01 rmation of HH. It would also be prudent to evaluate for signi /uniFB01 cant ascites, because if it is present it also serves as a likely and often primary target for drainage to improve symptoms.",

      "content": "Thoracentesis has been the standard diagnostic and therapeutic treatment option for management of HH and is typically considered a low-risk procedure. 11,12 However, the bene /uniFB01 ts are often temporary, and many patients reaccumulate large amounts of /uniFB02 uid in very short amounts of time. Performing procedures on HH patients may provoke multiple concerns related to coexisting coagulopathy and removal of large volumes of /uniFB02 uid commonly found in patients with liver failure. Previous studies suggest that coagulopathy, in particular thrombocytopenia and elevated INR, seem to have minimal association with increasing bleeding risk during thoracentesis when performed by experienced operators. 13,14 In general, we do not advocate for preprocedural blood product administration (fresh frozen plasma, platelet infusions, and so forth) for thoracentesis. We also generally do not advocate for premature stopping of thoracentesis at prespeci /uniFB01 ed volumes, such as 1 liter. Reexpansion pulmonary edema has been reported, but it is considered rare and without validated methods to predict risk. 15 As a result, we generally attempt to fully drain the space, stopping drainage if patients develop symptoms suggestive of lung entrapment or signi /uniFB01 cant drop in pleural pressure occurs. The role of pleural manometry remains debatable, 15,16 but based on current evidence we do not recommend it routinely. Fluid and protein loss is a particular concern in advanced liver disease. The practice of administering albumin solution, as used during large volume paracentesis, is not supported by current evidence or guidelines during thoracentesis. It has been advocated by some, particularly in the context of draining larger volumes of /uniFB02 uid, but further research is needed to clarify the role of albumin.",

Imaging suggests no signi /uniFB01 cant pleural effusion.\nDuring the initial management of hepatic hydrothorax, general goals should be directed toward relief of symptoms as well as focus on the underlying problem.

      "content": "We would again offer thoracentesis in light of worsening dyspnea, radiographic evidence of worsening HH, and likely optimized medical management. Given his recent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, pleural infection (spontaneous bacterial pleuritis) should also be ruled out. Thoracentesis would be offered as a bridge to additional discussions for longer-term pleural management options, also attempting to keep him an outpatient. Additionally, this would help con /uniFB01 rm that his current pulmonary symptoms (dyspnea) are related to his hydrothorax, and that drainage improves symptoms.\nWe consider serial thoracentesis a standard treatment modality for HH, but recent data have prompted reevaluation. Shojaee et al 18 evaluated serial thoracentesis, noting increased cumulative risk of complications associated within a HH population compared with a non-HH population. They ultimately reported that cumulative complication risk in the HH group was 12.2%. Limitations of this study\ninclude its retrospective nature, large number of trainees performing thoracentesis, as well as a fairly low overall complication rate (17/462 ¼ 0.03%), all making generalizability potentially a concern. Although this study has caused some reexamination of what we consider standard management and calls for additional research, other small retrospective studies have suggested the use of chest tube drainage is associated with poor outcomes as well, including increased risk of death secondary to empyema and sepsis in HH 19-21 (Table 1). Additionally, larger database series associate poor outcomes in HH patients undergoing tube thoracostomy. A Taiwanese national database identi /uniFB01 ed 2,556 propensity-matched patients with cirrhosis (1,278 chest tube, 1,278 thoracentesis) with 30-day mortalities of 23.5% for tube thoracostomy and 18.6% for thoracentesis. 2 A similar American study (2009 national inpatient data sample) identi /uniFB01 ed patients with cirrhosis undergoing thoracentesis (1,766) and chest tube (205), reporting a 2 /C2 greater inpatient mortality in the chest tube drainage group. 22\nAs a general statement, we try to avoid tube thoracostomy in HH 23 based on the current data as well as recent guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. 4 Tube thoracostomy and pleurodesis remains in the algorithm of HH management options. However, the data do not appear to support improved outcomes with the use of tube thoracostomy, and the authors have anecdotally also had poor experiences/outcomes with such interventions. Additionally, moving forward with tube thoracostomy and chemical pleurodesis attempts commit patients to signi /uniFB01 cant hospital stays while awaiting pleural symphysis. 22,24-26\nFrom the history provided, the patient appeared to be reaching the limits of medical optimization. We would contact hepatology to con /uniFB01 rm or deny this, also con /uniFB01 rming he was not a candidate for additional medication options (eg, splanchnic/peripheral vasoconstrictors) or nonmedical interventions (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt [TIPS]). We would also discuss the potential for liver transplantation and focus on multidisciplinary evaluation of management options for recurrent pleural disease, including the potential for more de /uniFB01 nitive pleural management (eg, indwelling tunneled pleural catheter [IPC], pleurodesis).",

He experienced no additional complications for another 2 months; however, during a hepatology clinic visit he complained of progressive dyspnea, was admitted to the hospital, and was found to have a large right pleural effusion. What were the management options for his pleural disease?\nAt this point, he appeared to have failed or had partial response to TIPS, as seen in up to 25% of TIPS recipients. In collaboration with hepatology, we would evaluate for interventions (eg, liver transplantation, Doppler investigation of TIPS, interventional radiology revision of TIPS, and so forth) related to potential TIPS failure. Additionally, we would collaboratively de /uniFB01 ne a pleural management plan moving forward, because refractory HH can be dif /uniFB01 cult to manage and may require multiple resources. In the setting of end-stage liver disease that is non-transplantable, management of HH becomes a palliative endeavor. However, in transplantable candidates, attempting to balance potential downstream implications of pleural disease management strategies remains critical to overall success. As with many pleural disease processes, management options include pleural drainage with thoracentesis, indwelling tunneled pleural catheter, or pleurodesis. Additionally, in HH there has been some focus on diaphragmatic defects and leakage, with attempts at surgical correction.",

      "content": "In general, we support the use of serial thoracentesis as a ' bridge ' and sometimes ' destination ' management option, including its use within inpatient and outpatient\nsettings. When this option is used, patients may need frequent clinic visits. We attempt to schedule outpatient visits based on prior pleural drainage needs, but in some extreme cases may see patients for large-volume pleural drainage 2 to 3 times per week to palliate symptoms and avoid hospitalization. This treatment strategy should be carried out in a multidisciplinary fashion with the hepatology and transplant teams and may not be ideal from some practice or logistical constraints. Some may transition to more de /uniFB01 nitive pleural drainage strategies as the frequency and needs of patients increase; however, the literature to support or refute these strategies remain sparse. There remains an absence of literature in nonmalignant pleural disease as to the ' correct ' time to consider transitioning to a more de /uniFB01 nitive pleural drainage strategy. Which approach offers the best palliation, safety pro /uniFB01 le, and cost-effectiveness also remains unclear. We continue to explore the use of IPC for HH management, acknowledging the data look interesting, but infection rates and potential to exclude someone from transplant candidacy is clearly concerning. 27,28 We also engage our thoracic surgery colleagues, inquiring about surgical interventions including pleurodesis and diaphragm repair. We review these additional strategies below, including a review of the literature to help support our comments.",

      "title": "IPC",
      "content": "The use of IPC in HH has become an increasingly debated topic. Because of frustrations and concerns related to pleural management options of HH, as well as previous experience in malignant pleural disease, many (including the authors) have begun to consider IPCs as an acceptable management option for select patients.\nIn general, the data (much like for thoracentesis and tube thoracostomy) come from small and retrospective\nseries (Table 2). These studies have identi /uniFB01 ed some evidence of pleurodesis, but also concern for infection, including some IPC-related mortality. 27-29 Two systematic reviews of IPC use in HH have also been performed, concluding that IPCs appear to be an acceptable therapeutic option. 30 Spontaneous pleurodesis rates are reported at 31% in some pure HH populations. 31 Additionally, a review of nonmalignant pleural effusions reports spontaneous pleurodesis rates of greater than 50%, but closer analysis of the data is more disappointing. This report is hindered by a heterogeneous population (only 12% with HH) and that many reported pleurodesis events occurring after transplantation, perhaps confusing true pleurodesis rates vs simple resolution of HH. 30 Complications rates including empyema (2.3%-4.5%) and catheter blockage (1.1%-2.9%) are also reported. A signi /uniFB01 cant limitation in all the above-mentioned IPC studies is the lack of patient-centric outcomes such as dyspnea and quality of life scores.\nA potential difference between the use of conventional chest tubes and IPCs in HH patient outcomes may be their intended purpose. Conventional chest tubes are often placed as an inpatient for complete pleural space evacuation or pleurodesis. Conversely, IPCs are placed primarily for outpatient symptom management with a drainage regimen that is symptom-guided or on an every-other-day basis. Conventional drainage often is no more than 1 L at a time, 32 potentially reducing the chance of volume loss, electrolyte loss, and renal failure previously reported with conventional chest tubes.\nAs a result, we agree that IPC remains an option for carefully selected patients with HH. The decision to proceed forward with IPC placement (or other more de /uniFB01 nitive pleural interventions) can be dif /uniFB01 cult and should not be made unilaterally. We suggest these decisions are best made in concert with the transplant team and patient/family, also suggested by other authors. 27,29,33 In nontransplantable patients, we often advocate for IPC placement sooner in the course of their disease process, because most goals are palliative in\nnature. However, in potentially transplantable patients, again it is often an ongoing discussion with the hepatology team about the current impact of HH, how an IPC may help, and the ultimate risks of IPC placement. Although some remain excited about potential IPC-related spontaneous pleurodesis, some authors have cautioned about the likely overestimation of reported pleurodesis rates, because in some studies half of the patients achieving IPC removal did so after liver transplantation. 27 Additionally, because the use of IPCs is not without consequence, the ultimate sin would be the development of an IPC-related complication (empyema) that precludes liver transplant -the only intervention with a mortality bene /uniFB01 t in this disease.",

This is also likely related to reports suggesting an increased risk of morbidity and mortality of taking patients with advanced liver disease to the operating theater. 34-36 The documented poor outcomes of nonhepatic surgical interventions may perpetuate decreased enthusiasm of thoracic surgeons; however, we do also suspect the role and involvement of thoracic surgery may be region and institution dependent.\nThe largest review of VATS or pleurodesis in HH identi /uniFB01 ed 180 patients with a pooled pleurodesis rate of 72%, but also a pooled complication rate of 82%. 37 Of note, within this analysis, the three largest series included Cerfolio and Bryant 38 (45 patients over unclear timeframe), Assouad et al 39 (21 patients over 12 years), and Milanez de Campos et al 40 (18 patients over 14 years). One study not included within this review was a larger, single-center, retrospective series of 63 HH patients undergoing VATS with diaphragmatic defect repair, suggesting a very good success rate (93.7%), but a total complication rate of 31.7%, including a 3-month mortality of 25.4%. 41 However, how generalizable the results of this series may be toward other surgeons or\ncenters is unclear, related to the fairly complicated perioperative care (pigtail drainage of effusion 1,000 mL qd /C2 3 and stabilization before operation, noninvasive ventilation for 5 days postoperatively, and so forth).
