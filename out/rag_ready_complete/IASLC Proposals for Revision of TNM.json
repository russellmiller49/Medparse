      "content": "Lung cancer stages, that is, coalescing the categories of the anatomic extent of the primary tumor (T), lymph node involvement (N), and number and location of metastases (M) into a practical system of groups, were introduced in the second edition of the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation published by the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) in 1975 and in the /uniFB01 rst edition of the staging manual of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) published two years after. 1 The revisions in this second UICC edition were based on the analyses of a North American database with 2155 patients. In their seminal article of 1974, Mountain et al. 2 reported graphs with distinct survivals for the three T categories (T1, T2, and T3), the three N categories (N0, N1, and N2), the two M categories (M0 and M1), and for stages I, II, and III, the latter including tumors invading beyond the\nlung (T3), mediastinal nodal disease (N2), and distant metastatic spread (M1). The survival curves of the different T, N, and M categories and of the three stages were so clearly different that no statistical comparisons were made and no p values revealed. Although this classi /uniFB01 cation and stage grouping were meant for clinical stage only, the authors posited that more precise evaluations of the extent of disease could be provided by an exploratory thoracotomy (surgical evaluative classi /uniFB01 cation) and by the examination of the resected specimen (postsurgical treatment classi /uniFB01 cation). The former, including invasive procedures, such as mediastinoscopy, thoracoscopy, and even exploratory thoracotomy, is now part of clinical classi /uniFB01 cation, and the latter is called pathologic classi /uniFB01 cation.\nStage IV, exclusively including distant metastatic disease, was introduced in the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation of lung cancer in the third edition of the UICC manual in 1978. Nine years after, the fourth edition of the UICC manual included innovations based on another article by Mountain 3 analyzing a larger database of 3753 patients with lung cancer. Stage III was subdivided into stage IIIA, for T3 and N2 tumors, and stage IIIB, for those classi /uniFB01 ed as T4 and N3, a new nodal category introduced in this edition of the classi /uniFB01 cation. The /uniFB01 nal changes in stages based on the North American database appeared in the /uniFB01 fth edition of the UICC manual and emanated, once more, from further analyses of an even larger database of 5319 patients reported by Mountain 4 in 1997. In this edition, stage I was split into IA for T1N0M0 tumors and IB for T2N0M0 tumors and stages II into IIA for T1N1M0 tumors and IIB for T2N1M0 and T3N0M0 tumors. There were no changes to the sixth edition.\nIn agreement with the UICC and the AJCC, the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) took over the responsibility of revising future editions of the TNM classi /uniFB01 cations of thoracic malignancies, namely, lung cancer, pleural mesothelioma, and thymic epithelial tumors. 5,6 Further revisions to the lung cancer classi /uniFB01 cation system were based on international databases compiled by the IASLC. In the seventh edition, although some tumors were recategorized upward or downward, there were no changes in the structure of the stage groups. 7 For the eighth, the granularity and the quality of the data registered in the IASLC database allowed the subclassi /uniFB01 cation of stage IA into IA1, IA2, and IA3 to accommodate the newly de /uniFB01 ned T1a, T1b, and T1c subcategories; the creation of stage IIIC for T3N3M0 and T4N3M0 tumors; and the subdivision of stage IV into IVA for intrathoracic and single extrathoracic metastases and IVB for multiple extrathoracic metastases. 8\nThis article reports the analyses performed to inform revisions of the stage groups for the forthcoming ninth edition of the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation of lung cancer. These\nanalyses, led by the Stage Group Subcommittee of the IASLC Staging and Prognostic Factors Committee (SPFC), are based on a new database of prospective and retrospective data especially collected to update the ninth edition TNM categories and descriptors. 9",

      "content": "For the analysis of TNM stage groups, only patients with a histologic diagnosis of Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), excluding squamous cell carcinoma in situ, were included. Patients were also required to have valid survival time, date of diagnosis between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2019, with follow-up truncated as of December 2021, and suf /uniFB01 cient T, N, and M data to assign the stage group according to the AJCC/UICC eighth edition system, excluding stage 0 and occult disease (Supplementary Fig. 2). An exception was made for one large registry data set where all patients were diagnosed in 2010, outside of the prespeci /uniFB01 ed time window, and one site was excluded from the /uniFB01 nal analysis due to concerns about aberrant patterns of correlation between clinical and pathologic N-category information. The patients who passed the inclusion criteria for the clinical, pathologic, and best stage analyses are described in Table 1.\nPatients included in the clinical (c) stage analysis (n ¼ 58,193) were required to have clinical T, N, and M categories and descriptors that allowed assignment of an eighth or proposed ninth edition TNM stage classi /uniFB01 cation. Overall survival (OS) was assessed from the date of diagnosis to death. Patients included in the pathologic (p) stage analysis (n ¼ 39,192) were required to have pathologic T, N, and M categories and descriptors that allowed assignment of an eighth or proposed ninth edition TNM stage classi /uniFB01 cation, with OS assessed from the\ndate of surgery to death. In addition, all patients included in the pathologic analysis had nonmetastatic tumors (M0), were managed surgically, and did not receive neoadjuvant treatment. Patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment were included in the pretreatment clinical stage analysis and analyzed in a separate pathologic stage analysis (yp). Best (b) stage (n ¼ 62,611) was de /uniFB01 ned as pathologic stage or clinical stage if pathologic stage was unavailable, the patient received neoadjuvant treatment, or the patient had metastatic tumor by clinical assessment. OS was the primary end point for all analyses.\nPatients included in the assessment of the eighth edition stage groups were not required to have complete T, N, and M descriptors recorded provided the stage groups could be reliably assigned but were excluded if any reported descriptors indicated a higher eighth edition T, N, or M category than was reported, suggesting a possible data entry error. Patients included in the assessment of the ninth edition stage proposals were required to have suf /uniFB01 ciently detailed tumor descriptors to assign them to the newly proposed N and M categories.\nWhen primary tumor size was the determinant of the T category and the stage group, the eighth edition de /uniFB01 -nitions were used whenever available -that is, solid by imaging for clinical and invasive for pathologic tumor size. Nevertheless, for approximately half of the cases, a T (and N and M) category was available without details of how size was measured. This re /uniFB02 ects the fact that the eighth edition recommendations for size measurement were not published until partway through the data inclusion period. These cases were combined; in general, separate analyses based on the type of size measurement used were deemed inappropriate due to confounding by time period. Nevertheless, a secondary analysis was conducted among patients with clinical and pathologic T1N0 tumors (where the type of size measurement is likely to have the most impact) using only the cases in which the solid (imaging) or invasive (pathologic) size variable was provided, to verify separation of the IA1, IA2, and IA3 and IB stage categories. Nevertheless, it is possible that in a few of these cases, the provided size might have erroneously represented total rather than solid or invasive size, due to the time it takes for awareness to disseminate and local data collection systems to adapt. Patients with tumors classi /uniFB01 ed as T1mi or higher before resection but which were determined to be adenocarcinoma in situ on resection were included in the clinical stage analysis but excluded from the pathologic stage analysis.",

Discrimination between the TNM categories aimed to separate patients into distinct subsets with similar within-group survival but different between-group survival. Several candidate proposals were evaluated using the training data set (two-thirds of the data, balanced by year of diagnosis, and data source: EDC or batch data sets). Proposals were evaluated considering the totality of evidence in accordance with the IASLC-SPFC ' s methodologic principles, 13 including the strength and consistency of statistical evidence, clinical relevance, and practical considerations such as backward compatibility and application in realworld settings.\nThe /uniFB01 nal proposal was evaluated with multiple approaches. One method involved recursive partitioning and amalgamation-generated survival trees 14 using the M0 best stage data set, strati /uniFB01 ed by the data source. The\nalgorithm generates a tree-based model using the R packages RPART 15 and RSPLIT 16 to maximize differences in survival between subsets created by an ordered variable for the current T-categories and newly proposed N-categories. Log-rank test statistics for the recursive partitioning and bootstrap resampling to correct for the adaptive nature of the splitting algorithm produces terminal nodes containing patients with similar survival outcomes.\nAnother method involved graphically evaluating OS curves generated using the Kaplan-Meier method 17 for clinical, pathologic, and best stage, with log-rank tests 18 for pairwise comparisons intended to reveal the presence or absence of expected survival differences among newly assigned TNM subsets. This included analyses assessing homogeneity within proposed subgroups and discrimination between proposed subgroups.\nFurthermore, Cox proportional hazards regression models 19 strati /uniFB01 ed by data source were created for both clinical and pathologic stage with adjustment for\nAIS, adenocarcinoma in situ; GDP , gross domestic product; Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) NOS, non-small cell lung cancer not otherwise speci /uniFB01 ed.\nNote : Changes to the eighth edition are in bold.\nd\nSolitary adenocarcinoma (not more than 3 cm in greatest dimension), with a predominantly lepidic pattern and not more than 5 mm invasion in greatest\ndimension in any one focus.\nh For example, the skeleton is considered one organ.

The R 2 values for models using the eighth edition staging criteria versus the proposed ninth edition staging criteria were compared to con /uniFB01 rm that the proposed criteria had performance that met or exceeded the existing status quo.\nGeneralizability was assessed with subgroup analyses to con /uniFB01 rm similar ordering of TNM subsets by data source (EDC, batch), histologic type (squamous, nonsquamous), geographic region (Asia, Europe, North America, ROW), Zubrod performance status (PS) (0, /C21 1), time period ( /C20 2017, /C21 2018), and treatment approach (surgical, nonsurgical, complete [R0] resection, neoadjuvant therapy). Finally, the proposed ninth edition stage classi /uniFB01 cation was applied to the previous IASLC eighth edition data set for external validation (i.e., in an independent data set). All analyses were conducted using the SAS statistical software package 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) or R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).",

      "content": "The decision to subdivide the N2 category into N2a and N2b created new subgroups, namely T1N2a, T1N2b, T2aN2a, T2aN2b, T2bN2a, T2bN2b, T3N2a, T3N2b, T4N2a, and T4N2b. New subgroups are also created by the decision to subdivide M1c into M1c1 and M1c2. The question for the Stage Group Subcommittee was how to coalesce these new subgroups in a manner that re /uniFB02 ects important differences and is clinically useful. Prognosis serves as an important tool to assess which groups align together, but application in the context of clinical care is the ultimate purpose of stage classi /uniFB01 cation.\nSeveral potential models of alignment of TNM subgroups into stage groups were considered. These were evaluated using several approaches and assessments of homogeneity within and discrimination between potential new stage group de /uniFB01 nitions. In addition, the committee considered how well potential models would align with current and evolving treatment strategies, including how disruptive potential changes to the stage classi /uniFB01 cation would be. For simplicity, this paper focuses only on the analyses involving the stage group model that was ultimately deemed best.\nThe recursive partitioning and amalgamation survival tree analysis provides an unbiased approach to assessing which subgroups appear prognostically aligned or distinct. The result from one such analysis (in a training set of 31,087 best stage M0 tumors) is found in Figure 1; Supplementary Table 2 illustrates the terminal nodes with their respective sample sizes and hazard ratios. This approach suggests, regarding the new N2 subgroups, that T1N2a aligns with other (eighth edition) stage IIB subgroups; T2N2a, T3N2a, and T1 N2b align with other (eighth edition) stage IIIA subgroups; T4N2a, T2N2b, T3N2b, and T4N2b align with other (eighth edition) stage IIIB subgroups. In addition, the survival tree analysis suggested that T1N1 aligns more with other (eighth edition) IIA subgroups than with (eighth edition)\nIIB. This alignment is re /uniFB02 ected in the proposed ninth edition stage groups found in Figure 2.\nThis was further evaluated using survival graphs of patients with tumors involving the potential new subgroup alignment described in the preceding paragraph. Homogeneity within potentially aligned subgroups was con /uniFB01 rmed for the new (ninth edition) stage groups IIA and IIB (Supplementary Figs. 8 and 9) and the new stage groups IIIA and IIIB (Supplementary Figs. 10 and 11). Speci /uniFB01 cally, in the total data set (validation and training sets), comparisons of TN subgroups within each potential new stage group revealed little difference, with only a few minor inconsistencies in some comparisons that were marginally clinically meaningful or statistically signi /uniFB01 cant.\nNext, evidence was sought that the TN subgroups to be potentially reassigned to a different stage group in the ninth edition exhibited distinct survival outcomes from the eighth edition group assignment. These analyses in the total data set (validation and training sets) con /uniFB01 rmed clinically relevant and statistically signi /uniFB01 -cant differences. Speci /uniFB01 cally, T1N1 was distinct from the stage IIB cohort ( P ¼ .001 for clinical stage and P < .0005 for pathologic stage) and T1N2a from the stage IIIA cohort ( P ¼ .04 for clinical stage and P ¼ .002 for\npathologic stage) (Supplementary Figs. 12 and 13). Similarly, T3N2a was distinct from the stage IIIB cohort ( P < .0001 for clinical stage and P ¼ .03 for pathologic stage) and T2N2b from the stage IIIA cohort ( P < .0001 for clinical and pathologic stages) (Supplementary Figs. 14 and 15).",

In addition, it was found that multiple extrathoracic metastases in a single organ system had signi /uniFB01 cantly worse prognosis than M1b ( P < .0001) and signi /uniFB01 cantly better prognosis than multiple extrathoracic metastases in multiple organ systems (M1c) ( P < .0001). This /uniFB01 nding was the basis to subdivide the eighth edition M1c into M1c1 (multiple extrathoracic metastases in a single organ system) and M1c2 (multiple extrathoracic metastases in several organ systems). Nevertheless, these changes did not affect stage IV because M1a and M1b remained in stage IVA, and M1c1 and M1c2 were\nassigned to stage IVB, consistent with the eighth edition M1 classi /uniFB01 cation. 11 The decision to assign different M categories to intrathoracic metastases and single extrathoracic metastasis was based on the fact that, although they have similar prognosis, they represent different forms of anatomic tumor extent that justify a different code in the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation. In the same way, M1c1 and M1c2, although having different prognosis, have worse prognosis than M1b, which supports both their distinction as speci /uniFB01 c subsets and their assignment to stage IVB.",

This proposed model was then validated in multiple ways. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for patients with tumors involving the proposed stage groups con /uniFB01 rmed clinically relevant survival differences between stage groups that were consistent in both training and validation data sets and for clinical, pathologic, and best stage (Supplementary Fig. 16 A and B ).\nFigure 3 illustrates survival graphs and 5-year survival rates of clinical stages of the eighth edition\nand of the proposed ninth edition models applied to the complete ninth edition data set. The graphs illustrate the expected degradation of survival as clinical stage increases, both using the eighth edition and the proposed ninth edition stage groups -with the exception of stages IIIC and IV that do not reveal signi /uniFB01 cant survival differences in both stage models ( P ¼ .0630 for 8th edition clinical stages and P ¼ .0643 for 9th edition clinical stages). Figure 4 illustrates the OS graphs and the 5-year survival rates of pathologic stage groups of the eighth edition and of the proposed ninth edition models. As for clinical stage, in both models, survival decreases progressively as tumor stage increases.\nCox multivariable analyses that adjusted for major prognostic factors are also found for the eighth edition and proposed ninth edition models in Figure 3 for clinical stage and in Figure 4 for pathologic stage. In clinical stage, in both models, patients below 65 years of age, women, patients from Asia, and those with nonsquamous cancers have a signi /uniFB01 cantly better prognosis than older patients, men, patients from Europe, North America, and the ROW, and those with squamous cancers ( P < .0001 for all comparisons).

      "content": "To ensure generalizability of the proposed stage classi /uniFB01 cation broadly across patient cohorts, tumors, regions, and settings, consistent discrimination between the proposed stage groups was assessed in multiple subset analyses. With few exceptions, survival graphs and 5-year survival rates in both clinical and pathologic stage reveal a consistent, ordered, and step-wise decline of survival as tumor stage increases. Supplementary Figures 18 A and B , 19 A and B , 20 A to D , 21 A and B , and 22 A and B reveal the survival of patients with tumors in ninth edition clinical and pathologic stages registered in the EDC and as batch; the survival of those with squamous and nonsquamous cancers; of those from Asia and Europe; of those from North America and ROW; of those with Zubrod PS 0 and greater than or equal to 1; and of those diagnosed in an early versus later time period, respectively. Supplementary Figure 23 A and B\nYears trom Diagnosis\nYears from Diagnosis\nillustrates the survival of patients with clinical stage tumors who underwent surgical and nonsurgical treatments, of those who underwent complete (R0) resection, and of those who received neoadjuvant therapy.\nThe few instances of overlapping survival primarily involved clinical stages IIIC and IVA; speci /uniFB01 cally, similar survival is observed in patients with such tumors whose data were submitted through the EDC (Supplementary Fig. 18 A and B ); in those from Asia (Supplementary Fig. 20 A and B ); in those from the ROW (Supplementary Fig. 20 C and D ); and in those with Zubrod PS 0 (Supplementary Fig. 21 A and B ). This overlapping was also found in the analyses of the eighth edition database. At that time, a decision was made to keep these two stages separate, despite the fact of having the same survival, because they represent different forms of anatomic tumor spread: stage IIIC groups locally advanced tumors, whereas stage IVA represents distant spread. In addition, in patients with clinical stage tumors who underwent nonsurgical treatment, the survival of those with stages IIB, IIIA, IIIB, IIIC, and IVA is similar, suggesting that other factors besides the extent of tumor spread may be the greater determinant of\nprognosis in patients managed nonsurgically (Supplementary Fig. 23 A ).",

      "content": "The IASLC ninth edition database has a similar number of assessable cases to the previous databases used to inform the seventh and the eighth editions of the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation of lung cancer, 9 but its greater granularity allowed the identi /uniFB01 cation of a way to quantify nodal disease that can be applied to clinical and pathologic classi /uniFB01 cations, that is, division of the N2 category into N2a and N2b subcategories. 10 The prognostic relevance of quantifying nodal disease was evident in the previous two editions of the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation, either by the number of involved nodal zones 21 or by the number of involved nodal stations. 22 In the seventh and the eighth editions, the greater the number of involved nodal zones or nodal stations, respectively, the worse the prognosis. Nevertheless, this type of quanti /uniFB01 cation was found only in pathologic classi /uniFB01 cation, using a selected group of patients who had undergone resection and a proper intraoperative nodal assessment. In both editions, these forms of quantifying nodal disease could not be validated in clinical classi /uniFB01 cation.\nThe two subcategories of N2 have produced new TN subsets with different prognosis that have to be assigned to stage groups. Thus, T1N2a was assigned to ninth edition stage IIB and T3N2a to ninth edition IIIA. T2bN2b was assigned to ninth edition stage IIIB. The new subsets T1N2b, T2aN2a, and T2bN2a remained in stage IIIA and T3N2b, T4N2a, and T4N2b remained in stage IIIB. In addition, T1N1 was downstaged from eighth edition stage IIB to ninth edition stage IIA. All these changes were adequately validated in subset\nanalyses involving both clinical and pathologic stage cohorts (Supplementary Figs. 8 -15).\nThe proposed assignment of T1N2a to ninth edition stage IIB is the most radical change in the ninth edition of the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation. Despite the changes that have occurred in the stage groups since their introduction in the second edition of the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation, N2 has remained in stage III. Clinical trials testing new therapeutic modalities, even in the era of targeted therapies and immunotherapy, 23,24 are based on traditional anatomic stage classi /uniFB01 cation, and the trials speci /uniFB01 cally studying therapies for N2 have included the full range of mediastinal nodal involvement, from a single lymph node to multiple nodal stations. 25\nQuantifying nodal disease in the way the proposed new N2 subcategories indicate will have clinical and therapeutic implications. From the clinical point of view, computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), or their combination (PET-CT) will have to be read carefully to assess and report the magnitude of mediastinal nodal disease. This seems to be possible, because in the ninth edition database, the different prognosis of N2a and N2b was con /uniFB01 rmed using mainly imaging techniques to determine clinical stage. At invasive clinical stage evaluation, needle aspirations at ultrasound-guided bronchoscopy will have to be as thorough as possible for histologic proof of single or multiple nodal involvement. It has been suggested that relying on examining the largest lymph node or performing a nodal sampling may not be enough to assess whether the tumor can be classi /uniFB01 ed as N2a or N2b. 26,27 The minimal requirements for an acceptable mediastinoscopy, recommended by the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons (biopsies of right and left inferior paratracheal and subcarinal lymph nodes), 28 may underestimate the quanti /uniFB01 cation of mediastinal nodal disease, especially compared with video-assisted mediastinoscopic lymphadenectomy, which offers the highest yield in identifying mediastinal nodal disease especially when invasive staging is indicated despite a normal mediastinum by PET-CT. 29 The assessment of nodal involvement with the highest certainty is relevant not only to indicate resection but also to plan the radiotherapy /uniFB01 eld with maximum precision. At resection, the alternative lobe-speci /uniFB01 c systematic nodal dissection 30 may leave involved lymph nodes behind that would be removed with the higher standard of systematic nodal dissection, that is, the removal of the fatty tissue and the lymph nodes of all ipsilateral mediastinal nodal stations. 31 When these lymph nodes are involved, prognosis is worse. 32 Clinical judgment will have to be exercised carefully to apply the best procedure for the most reliable staging. Although the thoroughness of intraoperative nodal assessment is essential for the\nquality of pathologic stage assessment, 33 the selective application of lesser procedures, such as lobe-speci /uniFB01 c nodal sampling, may be adequate in early stages. 34,35\nTreatment of T1N2a tumors should not change from what the clinical guidelines recommend for stage IIIA cancers (the stage for which we have recommendations based on trials). 36 As it has been emphasized before, a mere change in the classi /uniFB01 cation of the anatomic extent does not imply an automatic change in treatment. 37,38 Changing the name assigned to the anatomic extent of disease does not alter the existing data regarding treatment results. Treatment recommendations should derive from properly designed clinical trials and not from taxonomic changes.\nThe other changes in the upstaged and downstaged TN subsets, important as they are because they re /uniFB01 ne the prognosis of patients with clinical and pathologic stage tumors, will not seem as drastic as the assignment of T1N2a to stage IIB, because, even if they change from substages A or B, they remain in their stage II or III. Likewise, the downstaged T1N1 from IIB to IIA remains in stage II.\nThe subcategorization of M1c into M1c1 (multiple extrathoracic metastasis in a single organ system) and M1c2 (multiple extrathoracic metastases in multiple organ systems) does not imply a change of stage because both remain in stage IVB. The subdivision is relevant to re /uniFB01 ne prognosis. In clinical practice, as with the determination of mediastinal nodal disease, the identi /uniFB01 cation of number and location of metastatic implants will be key to proper categorization of the M component of the classi /uniFB01 cation.\nThe proposed ninth edition stage groups (Fig. 2) have been found to be generalizable across time, regions, settings, and a spectrum of patients and tumor types. Speci /uniFB01 cally, subgroup analysis revealed consistent ordering and discrimination by type of data base (EDC and batch) (Supplementary Fig. 18 A and B ); type of tumor (squamous and nonsquamous) (Supplementary Fig. 19 A and B ); geographic region (Asia, Europe, North America, and ROW) (Supplementary Fig. 20 A -D ); Zubrod PS (0 and 1 þ ) (Supplementary Fig. 21 A and B ); time period (Supplementary Fig. 22 A and B ) and in surgically treated patients and in those in whom resection was complete (Supplementary Fig. 23 A and B ).\nAmong the patients with clinical stage tumors who did not undergo resection, the survival curves of locally advanced cancers and of those in stage IVA are not so clearly distinct from each other as those of the other analyzed subgroups, and they tend to meet quite early after diagnosis. The proposed ninth edition stage groups work relatively well in those tumors that have received neoadjuvant treatment (yp), but their absolute survival, stage by stage, is generally lower than the survival of\ntheir pathologic stage counterparts that have been completely resected without neoadjuvant treatment.\nThe AJCC seeks to ideally ful /uniFB01 l /uniFB01 ve criteria of a stage classi /uniFB01 cation for formal adoption. These /uniFB01 ve proposed AJCC criteria include the following: discrimination, calibration, generalizability, clinical relevance, and parsimony. Discrimination, de /uniFB01 ned as the ability of the proposed stage classi /uniFB01 cation to distinguish between patients with different prognoses, was established with log-rank pairwise comparisons of survival between adjacent groups in adjusted multivariable Cox models. In addition, the SPFC suggested at least a 5% difference in survival between neighboring groups to justify the subdivision of a group to ensure a clinically meaningful difference in survival.\nCalibration, the agreement between predicted and observed outcomes, is primarily applicable to a prognostic prediction model. Prognostic models should account for traits beyond the TNM stage group of the tumor, including patient-related, environment-related, and treatment-related factors. Thus, prognostication is not a stated goal of IASLC ' s Staging Project. 39 We welcome external applications that use the TNM stage classi /uniFB01 cation in combination with other patient traits to assess calibration tools but /uniFB01 nd this endeavor to be outside the scope of the current analysis.\nGeneralizability, the ability of the classi /uniFB01 cation system to work well in different populations and settings, is a major focus of the SPFC ' s initiative. The proposed ninth edition TNM stage groups were evaluated in clinical, pathologic, and best stage, and within several meaningful subgroups: histologic types, geographic region, PS, and treatment modality.\nClinical relevance, the usefulness of the classi /uniFB01 cation system in clinical practice, highlights that stage classi /uniFB01 -cation systems should provide clinically relevant information that can be used to guide treatment decisions. The decision to split N2 into N2a and N2b and to subcategorize M1c into M1c1 and M1c2 was based on evidence suggesting that heterogeneous survival and different burdens of disease were inadequately described in the eighth edition ' s combined categories. These characteristics are often already considered when identifying the preferred treatment approach. We anticipate that these changes to the stage classi /uniFB01 cation system will better describe current practices of clinical management and allow for deeper investigation of these traits in the future.\nFinally, parsimony refers to a stage classi /uniFB01 cation system that is simple and easy to use. To uphold a parsimonious system, the clinical and pathologic TNM stage categories remain identical, and the same tumor descriptors continue to be used for both. In addition, for the proposed ninth edition criteria, existing stage\nclassi /uniFB01 cations were retained whenever possible to allow for backward compatibility and ease of adoption.\nThe R 2 statistics of the proposed model for the ninth edition clinical and pathologic stage groups are higher than those for the model of the eighth: 65.0371 and 64.9454 for ninth and eighth edition clinical stages, respectively; and 46.0529 and 45.5623 for ninth and eighth edition pathologic stages, respectively (Figs. 3 and 4). Although the anatomic tumor extent explains a major part of the prognosis associated with lung cancer, the anatomic stage classi /uniFB01 cation system is not designed to be a prognostic model. Prognosis is multifactorial and depends on tumor-, patient-, environment-, and treatment-related factors. 40 Developing a prognostic model is complex. It must be /uniFB02 exible to allow for inclusion of newly identi /uniFB01 ed prognostic factors and user friendly to be useful in making decisions in current clinical practice. 41 The ninth edition database includes nonanatomic elements, including biomarkers, 9 that will be used to build prognostic groups, that is, the association of different prognostic factors that predicts prognosis better than any of the individual prognostic factors. 42,43 This will start being explored for the ninth edition TNM but will be more relevant in the tenth edition as more detailed data will be collected.\nAs was the case for the seventh and the eighth edition databases, the number of patients from the different geographic regions is unbalanced. In the ninth edition database, cases from Asia and Europe predominate and those from North and South America, Africa, and the ROW are underrepresented. Nevertheless, the trend is toward an increasing number of cases from South America and, for the /uniFB01 rst time in the history of the IASLC Lung Cancer Staging Project, there are cases from Africa and the Middle East. 9 This imbalance of geographic origin does not invalidate the recommendations for the ninth edition because they have been solidly supported by their validation in clinical and pathologic staging and in different subgroups and have revealed generalizability in different geographic regions. It is also clear that the quality of batch data is suboptimal compared with data registered in the EDC system, and that the latter should be the favored system for data collection in future revisions of the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation of lung cancer. Nevertheless, good quality batch data should not be discarded because, in spite of their limitations, the proposed ninth edition recommendations could be validated in both EDC and batch databases, revealing that batch data, if adequately complete, can be reliable enough for analysis.\nThe eighth edition stage classi /uniFB01 cation proposals, which were adopted by the UICC and AJCC in 2017, were to report both solid/invasive size and total size (including a ground-glass component for clinical and a lepidic/noninvasive component for pathologic assessment), but to use\nthe solid (clinical) or invasive (pathologic) measurement to de /uniFB01 ne the size. 44 -46 Although information was submitted on the solid/invasive size in the latter portion of the accrual period, very few cases included information on the total size. Therefore, we were not able to validate in the ninth edition database that solid/invasive size is a better prognostic predictor than total size, as had been found in the eighth edition analysis (and many other studies). Adjustment for invasive rather than total size in pathologic stages I to IIA nonmucinous lung adenocarcinomas has been found to downstage 22% of tumors. 47 More detailed data collection will be an emphasis for the tenth edition of TNM classi /uniFB01 cation.\nThe main limitation of this study is that it incompletely accounts for confounders. Developing a stage classi /uniFB01 cation system requires con /uniFB01 dence that prognosis, which is used as the primary tool, largely re /uniFB02 ects the impact of the anatomic tumor features instead of confounding factors. Associated confounders that cannot be altered (e.g., age, comorbidity, PS) are less concerning than those that are under our control, such as treatment strategy, which can change signi /uniFB01 cantly as we are constantly striving to improve patients ' prognosis. We were only partially able to adjust for the impact such factors have on prognosis in the analyses conducted by the SPFC.\nIn conclusion, the rearrangement of new TNM subsets conditioned by the split of the N2 category into N2a and N2b and of the M1c category into M1c1 and M1c2 improves the granularity of nomenclature about anatomic extent that has bene /uniFB01 ts as treatment approaches become increasingly differentiated and complex.",
