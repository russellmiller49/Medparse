      "content": "A solitary pulmonary nodule is defined as a single, well-demarcated radiographic opacity measuring less than 3 cm in diameter, and is surrounded by lung tissue. It may be solid, subsolid, or ground glass. Solitary pulmonary nodule is a specific clinical entity with fairly well-known risk-ascertainment clinical prediction tools. Multiple pulmonary nodules can be an entirely different clinical problem. Peripheral pulmonary nodules (PPN) pose significant diagnostic challenges to pulmonologists because, unlike endobronchial lesions, there is lack of direct visualization of PPN during bronchoscopy that results in unsatisfactory reach of diagnostic instruments to the nodule. Conventional bronchoscopy and transbronchial biopsies have a low sensitivity (14%-63%) for diagnosing malignant lesions. 1,2 The yield is particularly low (30%) for PPN less than 2 cm in diameter. 1,2\nWith the advent of low-dose computed tomography (CT) lung cancer screening, pulmonologists are expected to dedicate a significant portion of their practice dealing with PPN. The National Lung Cancer Screening Trial demonstrated lung nodules in at least 39% of the participants, of which 72% required further investigation. 3 PPN greater than 2 cm in diameter may carry risk of malignancy in the range of 64% to 82%. 4 Although several characteristics of a nodule may determine the probability of a nodule being malignant or benign, none of them can be conclusive on their own, except perhaps complete calcification. Comparison with prior images is extremely helpful, but older images may not always be available.\nAlthough several modalities of performing biopsy of PPN are available, each has its own pros and cons. For instance, CT-guided transthoracic needle biopsy of PPN has a higher sensitivity for",

      "content": "Conventional transbronchial biopsy for diagnosis of peripheral lung nodules has been almost phased out. Although it is true that larger lesions may well be successfully sampled with traditional transbronchial lung biopsy with fluoroscopy, the challenges with smaller, particularly peripheral lesions are obvious. Although conventional bronchoscopy is still an excellent tool for endobronchial lesions, its diagnostic sensitivity for smaller nodules (<2 cm) in the periphery of the lung is dismal. A review of literature suggests the diagnostic yield of conventional bronchoscopy for PPN is 43% to 65%, much less for smaller peripheral lesions, about 14% to 31%. 5 Table 1 provides a summary of key studies over a 20-year period from 1967 to 1995 with little improvement in diagnostic yields over time, particularly for small nodules. Even extending CT fluoroscopy, conventional bronchoscopy does appear to improve the yield. 6\nNewer advanced technologies such as electromagnetic navigational (EMN) bronchoscopy have replaced conventional bronchoscopy in the diagnosis of peripheral lung nodules.",

      "content": "Radial probe endobronchial ultrasound (RP-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), OlympusMedical Systems, Tokyo, Japan) is a technology that uses ultrasound properties to provide a minimally invasive modality to visualize the airways structure and the lung parenchyma. Originally intended to visualize the airway and mediastinal structures, RP-EBUSisnowmainlyusedtovisualize and sample PPN. It consists of a miniature ultrasound probe (20-30 MHz) with a rotating tip that allows a 360 /C14 view of the target lesion ( Fig. 2 A). It is one of the very few image-guided modalities for diagnosis of PPN that offers real-time confirmation of the PPN. The probe may be threaded through the working channel of a flexible bronchoscope, and given its small diameter, it can be advanced all the way to the periphery of the lung. The RP-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) image of normal lung parenchyma has a 'snowstorm' appearance, whereas a solid lesion had a dark and 'solid' appearance ( Fig. 2 B, C). However, RP-EBUSdoesnotpossesstheabilitytosamplethe target lesion by itself. The RP-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) has to be retracted and the biopsy instruments passed in its place. Given the difference in caliber and flexibility between RP-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and the biopsy tools, it is not always possible for the biopsy tools to retrace the samepathtraversedbytheRP-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS).Toovercome this challenge, a guide sheath (GS) (also called extended working channel - EWC) is first threaded into the working channel of the bronchoscope through which the RP-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) is passed. After the RP-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) reaches the target lesion, the GS is then advanced over the RP-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and positioned just\nDownloaded for Anonymous User (n/a) at NAVAL MEDICAL CENTER SAN DIEGO from ClinicalKey.com by Elsevier on July 19, 2024.

The RP-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) is then removed, and biopsy instruments are passed through the GSsothere isdirect accessto the target lesion. This RP-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-GS method is popular in centers that do not use navigational bronchoscopy. Occasionally, a curette with an angulated flexible tip is usedtonavigate through difficult turns and the GS is advanced over the curette. This allows the RPEBUStobeadvanced to difficult to reach locations.\nBased on a large meta-analysis, the overall diagnostic yield of all techniques using RPEBUS is about 73% for lung cancer. 7 Used as standalone, RP-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) has a diagnostic yield of about 69% for diagnosis of PPN. 8 In this study, use of GS with RP-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) has a diagnostic yield of 84% compared with 48% if GS was not used along with RP-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS). Interestingly, whether used as adjunct with ENB, or as standalone, RP-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) seems to have similar diagnostic yields (73% vs 71.4%). 9 A recent systematic review of 57 studies and 7872 lesions showed an overall diagnostic yield for RP-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) at 70.6%. 10\nIn addition to size of the target lesion, the position of the radial probe position of RP-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) in relation to PPN has been shown to impact diagnostic yields. 8 The location of the probe directly within the lesion was 8 times more likely to have success with adequate sampling than when the probe was eccentric or tangential to the lesion (diagnostic yield 84% vs 48%).\nThe RP-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-GS is much more cost-effective than navigational bronchoscopies, but also requires more experience and detailed study of CT chest findings so a 'mental preprocedural planning' may be performed before the procedure. In the United States, RP-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) is more widely used along with one of the navigational bronchoscopy techniques, rather than a standalone modality for biopsy of PPN.",

Using 488-nm wavelength laser, the CLE provides a fluorescence image of the target area. The image shows fluorescence of elastin in the connective tissue matrix of the bronchial mucosa or the alveolar walls. The generated image covers an area that is 600 m min diameter around the probe, which is in direct contact with tissue. 11 Images may be obtained with still images or video of the area. Normal lung parenchyma is identified by the thin structure of the alveolar walls and the thicker, more solid-appearing structures of blood vessels ( Fig. 3 A).

Some centers prefer the use of CLE to RP-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) because CLE offers a better view of lung parenchyma, especially the alveolar vessels, and therefore, it may also be used while selecting appropriate sites for transbronchial lung biopsy and cryobiopsy in interstitial lung disease.",

Navigational bronchoscopy technology uses images from a chest CT scan to reconstruct a 3-dimensional (3D) map of the airways and the surrounding lung tissue. This is used to create 'virtual bronchoscopy,' a bronchoscopic view and pathway from the trachea to the target lesion. Several different navigational bronchoscopy platforms are now available for commercial use: they differ in how this virtual bronchoscopic path is used to aid real-time bronchoscopy in reaching a target lesion.

      "content": "Virtual bronchoscopic navigation (VBN), also called virtual navigational bronchoscopy, is a technique thatuseschestCTimagestocreatea3Dreconstruction of the airways and the lung. A virtual bronchoscopic view of the airways is obtained, and the software allows a virtual pathway from the central airways all the way up to the selected target lesion in the lung periphery. This virtual pathway to the target lesion acts as a map to allow the bronchoscopist to guide the bronchoscope and the biopsy instruments through the smaller airways to reach the PPN. The accuracy of reconstructing the airways, particularly the smaller ones, depends on the quality of the CT images. Thus, thinner slices and highvolume CT data result in more accurate virtual images. Although several VBN platforms are available, none possess the ability for real-time tracking of instruments during the actual procedure, which led to its successors, the electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy (ENB) systems. Even without realtime tracking ability, VBN can be used in conjunction with radial probe endobronchial ultrasonography (RP-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)) and ultrathin bronchoscopy to improve the diagnostic yield of PPN biopsies.\nPooled diagnostic yield using VBN is in the range of 72% to 74%. 7,14 For smaller lesions (diameter /C20 2 cm), the yield is lower at around 67%. 14 Whether use of VBN results in improved diagnostic yield in PPN is unclear: one trial demonstrated superior diagnostic yield with VBN and RPEBUS use in lesions /C20 30 mm diameter (80% compared with 67%), 15 whereas the same investigators had demonstrated earlier in another randomized trial no significant improvement in diagnostic yield for /C20 30-mm lesion using VBNassisted techniques (67% compared with 60%). 16 Of note, the former study used RPEBUS with VBN and the latter study used ultrathin bronchoscopy with VBN.\nArecent advance in the VBN system is the Bronchoscopic Transparenchymal Nodule Access (BTPNA) system (Archimedes System/Broncus Medical, Inc, San Jose, CA, USA). In BTPNA, VBN guides navigation to the nearest airway in the target lesion's vicinity. The software creates a tunneled path through the lung parenchyma and around the blood vessels directly to the peripheral lesion, which can then be sampled and treated. This may be particularly useful in lesions lacking the 'air bronchus sign.' In a human trial in 12 patients, this technique was successfully applied to 10 patients (track could not be created in 2 patients), and in all 10 cases where a transparenchymal track could be created, the diagnostic yield for BTPNA was 100%. 17 This promising technique needs validation with wider use in different PPN locations, and in a larger number of patients.",

The software automatically then creates a pathway from the trachea to the target. After review of the path, the operator moves on to the next step, which displays a 'virtual fly through' ( Fig. 4 B), which can be reviewed by the operator before proceeding to the registration phase. The next step is to identify landmarks on the virtual airway in case manual registration needs to be performed during the procedure. These registration\npoints are usually easily identifiable landmarks such as the main carina and lobar bronchi ( Fig. 4 C).

The purple line leads to the target lesion, which is represented as a green sphere. The LG is advanced as close to the green sphere as possible, and the EWC (or 'edge' catheter), which accompanies the LG, is fixed at this position. Ideally, multiplanar confirmation of satisfactory position of the LG in relation to the target lesion should be done ( Fig. 4 D). The LG is then removed, and at this juncture, the RP-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) or CLE probe\nmay be passed through the EWC to obtain real-time confirmation of the target lesion.

      "title": "Factors Affecting Diagnostic Yield",
      "content": "Although successful navigation to the target lesion occurs in more than 90% of cases, the diagnostic yield remains lower. This apparent paradox is explained by several factors affecting diagnostic yield with ENB:\n1. Bronchus sign: The presence of a bronchus (on CTscan) leading to the PPN increases the overall diagnostic yield from 67% to 88%. 21\n2. Location of PPN: Although there are mixed reports, lower lobe location of PPN particularly close to the diaphragm may have a lower diagnostic yield compared with upper lobe location (77% vs 29%). 22 The reason for this is likely the respiration-related movement of the diaphragm may result in navigation error as the CT scans to create the virtual map is performed during a single breath-hold (superDimension) and does not take into account the movement of the nodule during respiration.\n3. Lesion size: Lesions less than 30 mm may have a low diagnostic yield compared with larger lesions (72% compared with 82% 23 ).\n4. Learning curve: There are nuances to using the ENB technology, and therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that experience is an important determinant of diagnostic yield with this technology. Not surprisingly, there are data to support this. 24,25\n5. AFTRE (average fiducial target registration error): AFTRE is the difference in the location of the tip of the LG in actual patient compared with its expected location on the virtual 3D airway map created from the CT images. AFTRE of less than 4 mm has been associated with better diagnostic yields. 26,27 With the newer versions of the software, this is less likely to be a concern.\n6. Identification of the lesion on fluoroscopy: Although touted to be important and commonly used in the United States, data from Europe note no difference in published yields with or without fluoroscopy.\n7. Anesthesia: Pooled data from the Wang Memoli meta-analysis 7 suggest the diagnostic yield for ENB is better with GA compared with conscious sedation (69% vs 57%). However, a retrospective study of 120 patients did not demonstrate a significant difference. 28 The investigators favor general anesthesia for patient comfort as well as for when trainees are involved with the procedure.\n8. Biopsy tools: Although 40 years of data have suggested that the use of the peripheral transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) is associated with higher yield even without navigation, it is still not commonly used. 29 Sixteen percent of the cases in the AQuIRE Registry used the peripheral TBNA, but it was associated with higher yield. 30 The Cleveland Clinic experience showed that a dedicated peripheral needle was associated with a yield of 63%, but when combined with bush and forceps, yield was 83%. 31 The use of a simple aspiration catheter is associated with higher yields than transbronchial forceps biopsy. 32",

      "title": "ELECTROMAGNETIC NAVIGATION: VERAN SYSTEM",
      "content": "This ENB platform (SPiN System; Veran Medical Technologies) has attempted to overcome certain challenges, such as the effect of respiratory motion while obtaining biopsies. In addition, the Veran system offers real-time tracking mechanisms of the biopsy instruments during the procedure. Another feature that is unique to this system is its ability to perform navigational TTNA at the same sitting, an option that may come in handy if the navigational bronchoscopy is unable to obtain satisfactory samples from PPN.\nJust like other EMN systems, the SPiN/Veran System generates a 3D map of the lungs based on an inspiration/expiration CT Scan Protocol. Stickers containing electromagnetic sensors ( Fig. 5 A) are placed on the patient's chest before CT scans and remain in place during the procedure to help guide navigation and track patient breathing. The planning phase is similar to the superDimension system but allows for automatic registration if the CT scan is performed with the skins sensors on the patient. Therefore, the CT chest scan with this system needs to be performed on the same day as the procedure. Although this may create logistical challenges, a hidden advantage may be the same-day CT scan may show regression or resolution of nodules in 7% of patients, thus obviating a procedure in these patients. 33 Often the SPiN planning software converts the scans and creates a dynamic 3D map that allows customization of views and selection of targets. The electromagnetic sensor-equipped stickers enable automatic registration and dynamic referencing throughout the entire procedure ( Fig. 5 B). Respiratory gating technology communicates with the electromagnetic sensors to track respiratory movement. The dedicated biopsy instruments contain electromagnetic sensors at the tip to allow continuous tracking of the\ninstruments to the target lesion ( Fig. 5 C). The manufacturer touts that fluoroscopy is not required for navigation success, and there are additional instruments that have tracking probes built in for added success.\nThe Veran system offers the flexibility of performing electromagnetic navigation transthoracic needle aspiration (ETTNA) of the target lesion as well ( Fig. 5 D). ETTNA may be performed as the first step or as an additional procedure if the navigational bronchoscopy is unsatisfactory. Transition from EMN to ETTNA may be seamlessly performed in the same sitting because the magnetic sensors are already attached to the patient and the target lesion selected in the planning software.\nIn a study of 50 patients with PPN sizes 19.3 /C6 10.7 mm and 54 mm, the overall diagnostic yield for ENB using the Veran system was noted to be 83.3%. The yield was 77% for lesions without bronchus sign. 34\nIn a pilot study to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the ETTNA feature of this system, ETTNA was found to be feasible in 96% of cases. The pneumothorax rate was 21%, and chest tube placement occurred 8% of cases. The diagnostic yield for ETTNA alone was 83% and increased to\n87% ( P 5 .0016) when ETTNA was combined with EMN. 35 Some centers use the ETTNA feature for dye marking or fiducial marker placement just before thoracic surgery.\nThere have been no comparative trials to compare the 2 navigation systems, but the authors suspect these are similar based on experience and limited available data.",

      "title": "ULTRATHIN BRONCHOSCOPY",
      "content": "A major limitation of traditional bronchoscopes is their inability to traverse beyond the subsegmental bronchi due to their relatively large circumference (4.9 mm to 6.1 mm in diameter), thus having to thread biopsy tools from a distance and resulting in lower diagnostic yields for PPN. Ultrathin bronchoscopes, as the name indicates, are much thinner than a standard flexible bronchoscope, ranging in diameter from approximately 2.8 to 3.5 mm ( Fig. 6 ). Compared with a standard flexible bronchoscope, the thinner bronchoscope has the ability to navigate beyond fifth- or sixthorder airways and close to a PPN while retaining visualization, in theory making biopsy attempts more reliable to obtain accurate samples from a\ntarget lesion. Dedicated miniaturized biopsy instruments can be used to obtain biopsies though the smaller working channel. However, secretions in the smaller airways may result in poor visualization as the ultrathin scope is advanced, and the smaller working channel may not be as efficient as a standard working channel in suctioning out secretions.\nUltrathin bronchoscopy is often combined with other techniques, such as virtual bronchoscopy, EMN, or RP-ultrasound for PPN tissue sampling, especially with the advent of a 1.4-mm-diameter RP-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS). 36 Used as a standalone tool, ultrathin bronchoscopy for PPN has a diagnostic yield of 57% to 70%. 7,36,37\nA combination of RP-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and ultrathin bronchoscopy has a reported overall diagnostic yield of 69%. 36 In this study, the diagnostic yield for a lesion less than 20 mm diameter was 36% compared with 77% for lesions larger than 20 mm. A hybrid tracking system that uses electromagnetic and image-based techniques to track the location of the bronchoscope within the airways has been reported. 38 A combination of ultrathin bronchoscopy (3 mm diameter), virtual bronchoscopy, and RP-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) may result in a slightly better diagnostic yield of 74%. 39 Despite these advantages, the sensitivity of ultrathin bronchoscopy used alone or in combination with other technologies for diagnosis of PPN is not conclusively superior to other bronchoscopic modalities.",

      "title": "PERCUTANEOUS APPROACH",
      "content": "TTNA of PPN may be performed under CT or fluoroscopic guidance. CT-guided aspiration and biopsies result in a higher diagnostic yield compared with fluoroscopy, 29 and therefore, most commonly used TTNA modality. The most widely used technique is a coaxial system; a larger-bore needle is inserted into the lesion under CT guidance, and a smaller needle is passed through the larger one. Thus, a single chest wall\nand pleural puncture allows for multiple samples to be obtained.\nIn a study of 203 patients 40 at an academic institution who underwent CT-guided TTNA of PPN, the sensitivity of CT-guided TTNA for lung cancer was 93%. The investigators also noted that the overall complication rate was 25%. Incidence of pneumothorax was 24%, with 7% of all patients requiring a chest tube. This trend has been consistent over time. A recent meta-analysis of 8133 procedures undergoing CT-guided core biopsies and 462 procedures undergoing needle aspiration demonstrated overall complication rates for core biopsy and needle aspiration at 38.8% and 24%, respectively. Pneumothorax rates for core biopsies and needle aspiration were 25% and 19%, respectively. The largest cross-sectional study noted a pooled risk of 15% of pneumothorax and 6.6% of needing a chest tube and 1% risk of clinically significant bleeding. 41 Several factors have been implicated, including the type/size of needle used, number of passes, location of lesion, degree of emphysematous disease, distance of PPN from the pleura, and procedure duration. 42\nOf interest lately is tissue adequacy for mutational analysis for lung cancer. CT-guided TTNA, particularly core biopsy, appears to have high sample adequacy in this regard. The average number of cells obtained by CT-guided needle biopsy is 500 cells per biopsy, 43 and samples may have nearly 100% adequacy for histologic and endothelial growth factor receptor mutation analysis. 43-45",

      "title": "FUTURE DIRECTIONS Cone Beam Computed Tomography",
      "content": "Cone beam CT scanning is a technique whereby a virtual target can be obtained and overlaid on fluoroscopic images with various tools co-opted from digital segmented angiography ( Fig. 7 ). One study noted a 91% navigational success with a biopsy yield of 67% for lesions greater than 2 cm and 75% for lesions less than 2 cm. 46 Ng and colleagues 47 described the technique of combining navigational bronchoscopy and cone beam CT with a robotic arm CT scanner.\nThe ability to perform real-time multiplanar confirmation with 3D reconstruction is a useful tool to confirm position of an instrument or the accuracy of a guidance technology. Portable systems can be used, but these have many limitations in their current configurations. Presently, another drawback of this technology is the high-dose radiation burst with its use; personnel have to leave the room, or stand behind a shield while cone beam CT 'spin' is in use to obtain a\nCT image. However, there are also data to suggest that the cumulative radiation dose per procedure is similar to CT-TTNA or low-dose CT scan procedures. 46 Furthermore, virtual targeting has the same drawbacks of other navigation systems wherein the lung is not static and the lesion may be moving. Also, error may be introduced with patient movement or atelectasis. This could be one of the areas for technology refinement, along with the addition of 4-dimensional motion tracking so that image acquisition can be made portable. Because cone beam CT is an adjunctive image acquisition tool, it can be used with other guidance systems like ENB, but considerations for interference with images and the possibility of the 2 systems giving different information are possible in the authors' experience.",

      "title": "Modality Selection/Multimodality Approach",
      "content": "Although each individual nonsurgical modality available for diagnosis of PPN has its own advantages and limitations, currently it is not possible to offer a recommendation on any one or combination as the diagnostic modality of choice. The only exception is the combination ENB and radial Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) probe. This is because of the inability of the safer bronchoscopic techniques to offer comparable diagnostic yields as percutaneous CT-guided biopsy technique, which in turn has a higher complication rate. Several factors affect the choice of a diagnostic tool for PPN:\n1. Availability of a specific diagnostic modality\n2. Wait times to undergo a specific procedure\n3. Diagnostic yield of a specific diagnostic test\n4. Complication rates of a specific diagnostic test\n5. Need for hilar and mediastinal nodal staging\n6. PPN characteristics, such as location, size, and presence or absence of bronchus sign\n7. High pretest probability of malignancy of a PPN may result in upfront surgical resection\n8. Clinician preference\n9. Patient preference (CT biopsy vs bronchoscopic biopsy)\n10. Cost for the patient, cost for the institution; some techniques may be cost prohibitive especially in developing countries\nProfessional societies' guidelines 48,49 for management of incidentally detected PPNs remain the best approach to initial assessment and management of PPN. PPN with high risk for malignancy may be directly referred to surgery. However, there seems to be increasing evidence to suggest that in select cases such as somewhat central location of indication of PPN, preoperative tissue sampling of thoracic nodes may have to be performed for accurate nodal staging. This is because of a higher incidence of false negative PET scans in such cases. 50 In such instances, there is variation in practice on whether bronchoscopic diagnostic testing should be limited to nodal sampling, or extend the procedure to obtain biopsy from the PPN in the same sitting. There is no such dilemma in intermediaterisk PPN or in patients who are deemed nonsurgical candidates. In these cases, nonsurgical biopsy is preferred to determine malignant or benign nature of the lesion. Factors enlisted above come into play while choosing one or more of the diagnostic modalities for obtaining diagnostic tissue from PPN. The authors usually perform a combination of navigation bronchoscopy with real-time confirmation of the lesion with RP-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and use rapid onsite cytologic evaluation. For lesions deemed nearly impossible to reach with navigational bronchoscopy, image-guided percutaneous modality is preferred. This approach may be done in a single\nA\nB\nsetting with the newer Veran Navigation system, which allows both navigational bronchoscopy and navigational percutaneous sampling. However, navigational percutaneous sampling is still not real-time and is subject to the same pitfalls as EMN with regard to error, and the risk of percutaneous biopsy is still the same. A bronchoscopy technique offers the additional benefit of being able to perform Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) nodal staging at the same time. On the other hand, a PPN abutting the chest wall may be more reliably sampled with percutaneous techniques with reduced risk of pneumothorax. No matter what guidance technique is used, there is still a need to obtain invaluable tissue samples. Even the choice of the inexpensive biopsy instruments has direct impact. Regardless, there continues to be a diagnostic drop-off between 'localization' and actual acquisition of diagnostic tissue. 51",

      "title": "SUMMARY",
      "content": "Given the widespread adoption of lung cancer screening programs, it is not hard to foresee that the incidence of peripheral lung nodules will only increase. Many of these nodules will require tissue sampling as part of management. Several modalities for sampling PPNs are available; none is perfect though. Bronchoscopic techniques have a better safety profile, but relatively lower diagnostic yield. With technological advances, in the not too distant future, bronchoscopic techniques such as navigational bronchoscopy may have diagnostic yields comparable to CT-guided biopsy and may well become the modality of choice for biopsy of PPN. They have the ability to provide additional information such as lymph node staging with endobronchial ultrasound, and perhaps even be able to offer therapeutic options in the future. Presently, the choice of modality for biopsy of PPN depends on probability of malignancy, physician preference, availability of resources in individual institutions, lesion location, the need for concomitant nodal staging, presence of risk factors for complications such as pneumothorax, and patient preference. As these emerging technologies undergo further refinement, a major factor determining the choice of modality will be the ability to obtain enough tissue for molecular markers.",
