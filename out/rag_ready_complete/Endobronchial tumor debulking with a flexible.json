(J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 2010;139:997-1000)\nHemoptysis, cough, and dyspnea are the most frequent symptoms of patients with exophytic tumor manifestations in lung cancer. 1-3 The high mortality of lung cancer is at least partially caused by locally advanced tumor growth resulting in atelectasis and pneumonia. Tumor obstruction of the central or peripheral airways can result in postobstructive pneumonia, which is difficult to treat. In such a case, a safe and effective bronchoscopic treatment modality is required to resolve symptoms and complications caused by airway obstruction. In these cases many interventional pneumologists use rigid bronchoscopy in combination with mechanical debulking with forceps, a neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd-YAG) laser, electrocautery, argon plasma coagulation (APC), or brachytherapy to treat endoluminal\nexophytic obstructing tumors. 4-6 APC and brachytherapy have the disadvantage that either a secondary bronchoscopy is mandatory or they do not allow the immediate opening of obstructed airways. For more detailed information regarding the advantages and disadvantages of each method, we refer the reader to the existing literature. 7 The flexible cryoprobe, introduced as a tool for immediate management of airway stenosis, extends the options of interventional bronchoscopy. 8 The flexible probe can be used in combination with the rigid bronchoscope to guarantee more safety during intervention and allows the use of additional techniques, such as stent implantation. Tracheal tubes allow the use of the cryoprobe in a flexible technique as well. Its 7.5-mm working channel enables therapeutic interventions with the cryoprobe, which is 2.4 mm in diameter, or the combination with APC in case of bleeding. 9,10\nThe aim of this analysis was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the flexible cryoprobe for immediate tumor ablation in patients with exophytic endobronchial or tracheal tumor obstruction in a routine setting in a center with much expertise with the use of the flexible cryoprobe.",

      "content": "The flexible cryoprobe (Erbokryo; ERBE, Tu ¨bingen, Germany) was used as described previously. 11 It can be used with the rigid bronchoscope after achievement of general anesthesia but also with the flexible technique in combination with a 7.5- or 8.5-mm Bronchoflex tube (Ru ¨sch, Kernen, Germany), which has separate oxygen tubing, after achievement of local anesthesia and sedation. The decision of which method to apply, as well as the use of additional techniques, was left to the discretion of the treating physician and based on published guidelines. 4,5 It should be noted that there is no ideal interventional strategy that can fully guarantee success and a safe outcome. The execution of any technique depends on the expertise of the team and the personal skills of the physician. If possible, we preassigned (in an expert discussion) the used interventional technique before each bronchoscopy. In cases with stenosis caused by an endoluminal tumor, almost all interventions were done as cryorecanalization (CR). In cases with mixed stenosis (with an additionally extraluminal tumor), we combined the techniques, such as CR and implantation of stents. Briefly, in general we used the following interventional technique. First, the cryoprobe is introduced through a flexible bronchoscope in combination with a flexible tube or a rigid bronchoscope. Second, the tip of the cryoprobe is pushed into the exophytic tumor mass, and freezing is started for 3 to 5 seconds with a footpad. Freezing is achieved with the Joules-Thomson effect: nitrous oxide is decompressed at the tip of the probe, which generates immediate cooling of the tip to /C0 89 /C14 C. Third, the cryoprobe and the flexible bronchoscope are abruptly mechanically removed, and thus a tumor mass of up to 10 mm is frozen at the tip of the cryoprobe and can easily be extracted. Fourth, rapid thawing of the extracted tissue is induced in a water bath for 5 seconds. Finally, the procedure is repeated until the exophytic tumor mass has been extracted and the target bronchus is reopened. After CR, subsequent stent implantation can be performed in the same session or APC can be used to stop bleeding, if needed. Additionally, some factors could influence the intervention. Among them, bleeding of the tumor limits visibility and can significantly extend the procedural duration, which normally has a range of 15 to 60 minutes. Chest radiographic analysis was not performed routinely after the intervention and remained at the discretion of the physician.",

      "content": "We defined our criteria to determine the success rate of CR. The bronchoscopist classified the intervention based on endoscopic criteria as (1) successful if the endobronchial tumor mass could be ablated so that either drainage of secretion or reduced airway stenosis led to a significant improvement in the patient's condition with amelioration of symptoms (eg, dyspnea, fever, or cough) and (2) not successful or a failure if the primary goal of the intervention (ie, target bronchus reopening) could not be reached.\nSafety data were evaluated regarding severity of bleeding, need for a rescue operation, or prolonged mechanical ventilation for longer than 2 hours after the intervention. Bleeding was graded as mild if application of cold NaCl 0.9 % solution (2 /C14 C-4 /C14 C) or epinephrine solution (1 mg/10 mL saline water) applied topically was sufficient to stop bleeding, moderate if additional techniques (APC or a bronchus blocker) had to be used, and severe if additional treatment was needed (transfusion of red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, or coagulation factors; use of vasopressors, rescue operation; or prolonged mechanical ventilation) to stabilize the patient's condition.",

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "content": "Patients with symptomatic bronchial obstruction caused by an endoluminal exophytic tumor require immediate treatment. Selection of the appropriate interventional technique depends on the treatment plan (curative or palliative intention) and on the type of tumor stenosis (endoluminal, extraluminal, or mixed). 5 The combination of both rigid and flexible bronchoscopy is the most commonly and widespread used method, and it allows additional use of APC, an Nd-YAG laser, electrocautery, or CR. The main advantage of the laser, electrocautery, and CR is their immediate effect by tumor ablation. The flexible cryoprobe allows recanalization within a single intervention without the necessity of a secondary bronchoscopy. The cryoprobe can be resterilized and reused without any restrictions in effectiveness. CR or tumor debulking with a flexible cryoprobe performed in the way that is described in this article is a relatively new approach. The previously performed feasibility study in our institution of 60 patients showed a high success\nrate (83 % ) of CR with a moderate bleeding rate of 10 % . 8 The present study confirms the findings of the feasibility study and showed that even under daily routine conditions in the bronchoscopy suite, CR of exophytic endobronchial tumor stenoses is safe and successful in about 91 % of cases. The success rate in our present study was even higher than in the feasibility study. 8 This might be explained by the learning curve of the CR procedure. A current chest computed tomographic scan to estimate the distance and complexity of the stenosis is mandatory before intervention to ensure safety and for the appropriate selection of patients. We tried to reopen longer tumor stenoses than were seen on the computed tomographic scan. However, in these cases a lower success rate has to be taken into account. This was also the case in our study, in which the main reason for unsuccessful intervention was a long tumor stenosis with infiltrative tumor growth. The duration of pre-existing tumor stenosis (as measured from the onset of symptoms) did not seem to influence the procedural success rate, even if partial atelectasis or mediastinal shift was seen. It was frequently possible to reopen 4- to 6-week-old tumor obstructions successfully by using CR. 11\nWe found a higher rate of moderate compared with mild bleeding in our study. Because the freezing has a hemostatic effect on minor bleeding lesions, it is likely that this is not sufficient in cases with severe tumor-associated bleeding. On the other hand, mild bleeding often occurs during bronchoscopic interventions in patients with lung cancer and is not always routinely reported as an adverse event. Therefore it can be assumed that the rate of mild bleeding is underestimated with conventional bronchoscopic techniques. However, with strict attention to normal coagulation parameters and platelet counts before the intervention, there was no severe bleeding complication in our study. For safety reasons, CR was not done if chest computed tomographic scans showed tumor involvement of large vessels in the interventional region.\nNote: Summery of cases might exceed the total number of cases because of overlapping lesional attribution. Bilateral localization , If cryorecanalization was performed in both the right and left bronchial system of the patient in 1 session; Central airways , trachea, left/right main bronchus, and bronchus intermedius; Peripheral airways , all other bronchi, distal of defined central airways; Extended lesions , if cryorecanalization was performed in both the central and peripheral airways in 1 session; multiple localization , if tumor stenosis was found and treated in different lobular bronchi in 1 session.\nSCLC , Small cell lung cancer; Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) , non-small cell lung cancer. *Nonmalignant lesions were as follows: benign tracheal stenosis, lipoma, endobronchial granulation tissue, and hamartoma. y Other malignant lesions were (number and percentage of all malignant lesions) as follows: colorectal cancer (17 [8.63 % ]), carcinoid (6 [3.05 % ]), lymphoma (6 [3.05 % ]), breast cancer (5 [2.54 % ]), ovarian carcinoma (4 [2.03 % ]), esophageal carcinoma (4 [2.03 % ]), renal cell carcinoma (3 [1.52 % ]), malignant melanoma (2 [1.02 % ]), thyroid cancer (2 [1.02 % ]), and laryngopharyngeal carcinoma (1 [0.51 % ]).\nAn important advantage of this new approach of CR with the flexible cryoprobe is that it can easily be performed with both flexible and rigid techniques. Compared with the Nd-YAG laser, which is still the standard technique in large institutions, cost for purchase, repair, and maintenance for the less invasive techniques of APC, electrocautery, and CR are lower. 5 A cost-effectiveness study revealed that the average treatment cost for the Nd-YAG laser was 20 % higher compared with that for electrocautery, which was caused by a longer hospital stay before bronchoscopic treatment. 12 Another advantage of CR is that large particles of tumor can be extracted with the flexible cryoprobe. Thus the time for effective tumor mass ablation is generally shorter compared with that for laser therapy. The shorter intervention time is one of the reasons why so many CRs in our clinic could be performed with the flexible bronchoscopy technique. Furthermore, the study shows clearly that the use of a tracheal tube as a working channel (instead of the rigid scope) is a feasible and safe option and allows a completely flexible interventional technique.\nAPC, which is also used for treatment of malignant airway stenosis, requires a second bronchoscopic intervention for the removal of devitalized tissue 48 to 72 hours after initial APC treatment. 10 We achieved a higher procedural success rate compared with that seen after APC. Reichle and colleagues 13 showed the efficacy of APC in 186 patients with malignant airway stenosis. They achieved ''good results'' in only 67 % of cases. Moreover, one has to take into account that in this study more than 90 % of interventions were performed with rigid bronchoscopy. In contrast, the rigid bronchoscope was used in only 13.8 % of interventions in our study. However, APC and CR can be effectively combined and do not exclude each other. We successfully used APC to stop bleeding after application of the cryoprobe in 16.4 % of patients.\nIn conclusion, CR is a safe and successful method for endobronchial exophytic tumor debulking. The flexible cryoprobe is easy to use and allows rapid removal of exophytic tumors under direct observation with low bleeding rates. CR can be regarded as an alternative primary tool and complementary method to APC, electrocautery, or the Nd-YAGlaser for endobronchial tumors. This study showed promising safety data for the routine use of the flexible cryo-\nprobe over the long-term. The main advantage of CR is its immediate effect on tumor stenosis with subsequent rapid improvement of the patient's symptoms. For future studies, we recommend additionally evaluating patient-related outcomes with the dyspnea scale and quality-of-life instruments.\nThe purpose of this nonrandomized study was to describe the safety and efficacy of a flexible cryoprobe as a primary tool for endobronchial recanalization in malignant lesions. As a retrospective study, a per-protocol patient selection was not conducted. However, a prospective randomized study will follow to compare different interventional methods regarding safety, efficacy, and selection strategies for each technique.",
