      "content": "Adequate drainage of the pleural space is the cornerstone of good post-operative management [1]. Several types of chest drainage systems are commercially available but systematic investigation of how they work is relatively sparse [2-4].\nChest drainage units (CDUs) that rely on water to make a seal and therefore are called wet-systems, or simply underwater sealed drains (UWSD), are very common. Although they exist in various shapes, all of them are based upon the Bülau-principle. The Bülauprinciple is a therapeutic drain using a permanent siphon generated by a Heber-drain within a closed system. The Heber-drain works according to the Heber-principle using hydrostatic pressure [5]: the vertical height between the chest and the CDU (hydrostatic column) determines the level of sub-atmospheric pressure applied to the patient.\nCDUs that do not rely on water to make a seal are called dry systems. In theory, the shift from 'wet' to 'dry' seal technology was intended to introduce a standardized\nframework to support patient recovery. In reality, dry seals have an entirely different structure and mechanism of function. Miniaturized Heimlich and electronic valves are indeed variously integrated in 'analogue' and 'digital' CDUs, respectively. This undesirable variability is an example of noise, the ubiquitous and often-ignored burden in clinical decision-making.\nThe choice of a medical device requires evidence which can be scarce and not fully available [6,7]. In addition, a 'one size fits all' CDU does not yet exist and therefore it is reasonable that one design can be adequate for one patient and not for another. Thus, it is important for clinicians to be aware of the pros and cons of the most common CDUs available on the market to improve patient outcomes [8,9].\nClinicians shall expect the following basic characteristics from the CDUs they use: to be designed to facilitate correct interpretation of changes in clinical status; to provide pressure protection, quickly and automatically; and to evacuate the highest airflow at the lowest pressure (low resistance).\nThis review is focused on two aspects: (1) rational choosing of the model of CDU among those commercially available and (2) understanding the use of all models along with data interpretation. Finally, we analyzed a new device capable of helping in removing barriers to rational choosing and optimal use of CDUs.",

      "content": "Thirty-two CDUs from ten manufacturers were collected. Relevant design characteristics were observed by sawing them apart (Table 1).\nCDUs were classified based on their mechanism of function (Table 2): 'wet-wet', where water is used to establish the seal (wet-seal) and to set the amount of wall suction (wet-suction); 'wet-dry', where water is used to establish the seal while a mechanical component is used to set the amount of wall suction (dry-suction); 'dry-dry', where mechanical or electronic components are built-in to create the seal (dry-seal) and to set the amount of wall or independent suction, respectively. UWSD were subclassified depending on the number of chambers as in one-bottle systems the Heber pipe is in direct continuity with the connecting tube (hence water can potentially rise all the way up to the pleural space), in multi-bottle systems the water seal is physically separated from the fluid collection chamber (but water can be siphoned out of the water seal chamber and into the collection chamber) and in compact systems a float valve on top of the water column prevents water from spilling over.\nTo test the CDUs, a pleural space environment simulator was built (Figure 1a). The experimental setup is illustrated in Figure 1b. A custom motherboard was engineered to assemble a programmable logic controller (PLC) interconnected with two independent pumps (0 to 3 L and 3 to 20 L/min), solenoid electro-valves, alloy-buffer chambers, two flow meters (0.07 and 0.12 psid pressure drop at full scale flow, response time 10 ms) and two pressure sensors (accuracy = 0.2 and 0.04% at full-scale range, respectively). The pneumatic circuit was made by tubing with a minimum internal lumen diameter of 8 mm. Hospital in-wall suction was recreated building a digitally controlled high-flow highvacuum pump with dedicated flow and pressure sensors. An ad hoc software interface was developed to create various breathing patterns. Normal and pathological conditions observed in the real life with unassisted spontaneous breathing or mechanical ventilation were simulated. A laser sensor was added to detect air bubbles when testing UWSD. BreatheCore TM gray-box testing was chosen for two reasons: (i) because it is a method that can be used to search for the defects, if any, due to improper structure or improper usage of applications and (ii) because our knowledge of how each of the CDUs worked was limited. Reliability was tested through five repetitions (test-retest reliability coefficient >0.9). Proper granularity of the measurements was guaranteed by high-resolution data logging (17 per second). Built-in controls included machine checks to automatically detect errors caused by equipment malfunctioning. Every CDU was tested under three conditions which have clinical implications. (i) Air movements through UWSD were simulated, breathing at 15 acts per minute at an intrapleural pressure from -5 to -150 cmH2O. (ii) Negative and positive pressure build up, which can be encountered in the event of obstructed inspiration and/or bronchopleural fistula, was simulated with an air pocket of 0.75 L at -100 cmH2O and a free airflow from 3 to 15 L/min, respectively.

      "content": "In a one-bottle UWSD (Single by Bio-Thorametrix, One bottle and Thora-Seal I and II by Covidien, Thoraflow by Meditea, Chest by Redax), water was raised real-time and unrestricted, to the point that it could be sucked into the simulated pleural space at pressures exceeding the vertical length of the Heber pipe plus the connecting tube (~170 cm).\nIn a compact UWSD (Oasis/Ocean by Atrium-Maquet, High capacity by Bio-thorametrix, Altitude/Sentinel Seal/Aqua-Seal/Thora-Seal III by Covidien, Rome/Venice by Eurosets, Compact/Variant/Simple3/Simple/Simple Plus by Redax, and Pleur-evac A6000 Cactus/A7000 by Teleflex), water was raised real-time and unrestricted for the length of the water column manometer (which varied between 15 and 25 cmH2O), on top of which a float valve shut-offed. Float valves were shaped like a cone or a ball. The former would always provide a hermetic seal, preserving the water seal but contributing to the build-up of large intrapleural pressure (Altitude/Sentinel and Aqua-Seal by Covidien). The latter would plug in the circumference of a plastic hole and, only if a notch was present would it still allow water to raise, until emptying of the reservoir with consequent RAF (Oasis/Ocean by Atrium-Maquet, Pleur-evac A6000 Cactus/A7000 by Teleflex) (Figure 2).\nThe higher the negativity, the shorter the time needed to break the water seal, achieving, therefore, pressure build-up protection. High capacity by Bio-thorametrix, Rome/Venice by Eurosets and Thora-Seal III by Covidien allowed RAF at relatively low levels of intrapleural pressure (24 to 28 cmH2O) maintained for an average of 35 s. Compact/Variant/Simple3/Simple/Simple Plus by Redax allowed RAF at a much higher level of intrapleural pressure (131 cmH2O) maintained for 244 s.\nIn those CDUs where the seal was made by a rubber flutter one-way valve or by an electronic vacuum pump (dry-dry), two automatic different vacuum release technologies were observed. In the former, an analogue pressure relief valve remained closed until -70 cmH2O, when it cracked open to the atmosphere and remained, so allowing flow as over pressure increased; the valve closed back again at -50 cmH2O, showing an operating hysteresis of 20 cmH2O. In the latter, a sensor had to detect the negativity first. Then, software had to operate an electronic pressure relief valve to cyclically open and close until system pressure was reduced to the set pressure. Dry-dry CDUs marked as thoracic drainage did not provide any pressure relief until -70 cmH2O, beyond which they were quick to react, providing continued pressure relief with a relatively low restriction to flow. The Express by Atrium-Maquet was quicker than the Pleur-evac Sahara 1100 by Teleflex (Figure 3).

Changes to CDUs' mechanism of function may lead to better results, as we demonstrated with a digitally controlled high-flow lowresistance valve providing instant help to a simulated patient with obstructed breathing.\nThe optimal management of post-lung resection patients is still unclear and we think that this is also due to CDUs not being totally understood. Unfamiliarity with heterogeneous technologies can lead to misinterpretation of the clinical data, hence misdiagnosis, ultimately ending in CDUs failing to support clinical decision making. This also creates a formidable barrier to tailoring chest drainage therapy to each individual patient.\nThere is a need for better safety and performance requirements and for clinical testing of new designs against traditional ones, as new technology emerges. This may enable personalized medicine concepts applied to chest tube drainage.",
