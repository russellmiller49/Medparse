These airway complications are associated with signi /uniFB01 cant functional impairment, poor quality of life, increased hospitalizations, and greater health-care resource use. 6,7 Despite\nABBREVIATIONS: BAR = bronchial artery revascularization; TBM = tracheobronchomalacia\nAFFILIATIONS: From the Department of Interventional Pulmonology (Dr Mahajan), Inova Heart and Vascular Institute, Inova Fairfax Hospital; the Department of Thoracic Surgery (Dr Khandhar), Inova Heart and Vascular Institute, Inova Fairfax Hospital, Virginia Common Wealth Medical School; and the Advanced Lung Disease and Transplant Program (Dr Nathan), Inova Fairfax Hospital, Falls Church, VA; the Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (Drs Folch and Channick), Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA; the Department of Interventional\nPulmonology (Dr Santacruz), Houston Methodist Lung Center, Houston Methodist Hospital, Houston, TX; and the Lerner College of Medicine (Dr Mehta), Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Respiratory, Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.\nCORRESPONDENCE TO: Amit K.

      "title": "Anastomotic Ischemia",
      "content": "The development of airway complications following lung transplantation is likely driven by the absence of systemic blood supply to the anastomotic region following surgery. Normal lungs and airways bene /uniFB01 t from a dual blood supply arising from the pulmonary arteries as well as the bronchial arteries. During lung transplantation, the bronchial arterial blood supply is not typically reconstructed. It may take up to 4 weeks before the bronchial artery circulation is re-established through collateral formation. 20,21 As a result, the donor bronchus is susceptible to ischemic injury during this period. The resulting necrosis incites an in /uniFB02 ammatory cascade, with associated bronchial lumen remodeling and an increased likelihood of airway complications (Fig 2). We favor avoiding low cardiac output, hypotension, and dehydration in the weeks following transplantation, as these factors may further decrease the blood supply to the anastomosis and increase the risk of ischemia. Direct bronchial artery revascularization (BAR) is a technique that aims to re-establish bronchial artery circulation during lung transplantation. Comparable early outcomes with and without BAR have been reported regarding the\ndevelopment of airway complications. Given the complexity of the procedure and equivalent outcomes, BAR is not routinely performed. Additionally, the potential for increased graft ischemic time and the possible need for cardiopulmonary bypass during BAR offsets possible bene /uniFB01 ts.",

      "content": "Multiple surgical options exist for anastomosing the donor and recipient bronchi during lung transplantation. The most commonly used surgical techniques include the ' end-to-end ' and ' telescoping ' anastomoses. The end-to-end anastomosis is accomplished by direct attachment of the donor bronchus to the recipient bronchus without overlapping of tissue (Fig 3). 22 Telescoping anastomosis involves overlapping the donor and recipient bronchi. This technique may become necessary when there is a signi /uniFB01 cant difference between the airway diameters of the donor and the recipient. Telescoping anastomoses are associated with a 48% incidence of airway complications, speci /uniFB01 cally anastomotic stenosis and infection. 22\nThe length of the donor bronchus can signi /uniFB01 cantly in /uniFB02 uence the development of airway ischemia. Anastomosing a short donor bronchus with a longer recipient bronchus may reduce the risk of prolonged ischemia due to the decreased length needed for collateral circulation formation. 23 In one study of 65 pediatric patients, shortening the donor bronchus length by dividing it at the lobar carina resulted in a reduction in airway complications in the /uniFB01 rst year\nfollowing lung transplantation vs the standard technique (2.6% vs 11.1%). 23",

      "content": "The development of obstructive granulation tissue can result in signi /uniFB01 cant airway obstruction within a few months of surgery in up to 20% of patients undergoing lung transplantation (Fig 4). 27 The presence of Aspergillus infection at the surgical anastomosis may exacerbate the development of granulation tissue and result in recurrent obstruction. 28 Airway debridement is the standard practice for the removal of granulation tissue at the surgical anastomosis.\nOur consensus opinion regarding the treatment of anastomotic granulation tissue depends on whether the\npattern of growth is obstructive or nonobstructive. We favor the use of /uniFB02 exible or rigid forceps for debridement of nonobstructive granulation tissue that is eccentric in nature. 29 Flexible forceps allow for precise debridement, whereas rigid forceps can be used for bulkier areas of granulation tissue. Obstructive granulation tissue resulting in airway compromise is best treated with cold therapies, including cryodebridement or cryotherapy. Cryodebridement can be performed using the cryotherapy probe to freeze granulation tissue, followed by withdrawal of the probe with the tissue attached. 30 Cryotherapy, in contrast, involves repeated cycles of freezing and thawing of obstructing tissue. This process crystallizes tissue, causing microthrombi formation along with intracellular and extracellular ice crystal formation resulting in cell death. 31,32 In the weeks following cryotherapy, necrosing granulation tissue sloughs off the airway without damage to the bronchial wall. Cryodebridement and cryotherapy are effective in recanalizing the airway without inciting further in /uniFB02 ammation. Hot therapies, such as Nd:YAG laser, argon plasma coagulation, or electrocautery, are also effective in restoring patency to airways, but they harbor the potential for generating further in /uniFB02 ammation and provoking more granulation tissue formation. Instead, these hot therapies are typically reserved to control bleeding following treatment with cryodebridement or cryotherapy.\nAdditional experimental therapies for the treatment of granulation tissue formation include topical mitomycin C and high-dose endobronchial brachytherapy. Topical mitomycin C is an antineoplastic agent that can halt /uniFB01 broblast proliferation. The use of topical mitomycin C after debridement has been demonstrated to reduce\n[\n]\ngranulation tissue recurrence in patients who have undergone lung transplantation. 33 Endobronchial brachytherapy also slows /uniFB01 broblast proliferation by concentrating radiation within the airways without affecting surrounding structures. 34 Although we consider these modalities to have great potential, randomized controlled trials are needed to validate sustained ef /uniFB01 cacy and safety.",

      "title": "Bronchial Stenosis",
      "content": "Bronchial stenosis is the most common airway complication following lung transplantation. The incidence of bronchial stenosis is 4% to 24% and typically occurs within 2 to 9 months of transplantation. 35-39 The presence of bronchial stenosis has been shown to be an independent risk factor for death after adjusting for confounders (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.03-1.23; P ¼ .007). 26 Although bronchial ischemia is a well-known risk factor for anastomotic stenosis, severe reperfusion edema and early rejection have also been shown to be independent risk factors. 25,26 CT imaging may be sensitive in identifying bronchial stenosis, but bronchoscopy remains the gold standard for diagnosis.\nTwo patterns of airway stenosis have been described following lung transplantation: anastomotic stenosis and nonanastomotic stenosis. Stenosis at the anastomosis is more common in patients in whom anastomotic necrosis, infection, or dehiscence has developed (Fig 5). Nonanastomotic stenosis occurs less commonly and develops distal to the anastomosis.\nTraditionally, the initial treatment of anastomotic and nonanastomotic stenoses involves balloon bronchoplasty. A controlled radial expansion balloon\ncan be used to dilate the stenosis to a speci /uniFB01 c diameter, with multiple in /uniFB02 ations held for 30 to 60 s, with or without /uniFB02 uoroscopic guidance. Balloon bronchoplasty may be the only procedure required in up to 26% of patients with bronchial stenosis. 40 Although we agree that balloon bronchoplasty may be effective in mild weblike stenoses by providing an immediate increase in airway diameter, the symptomatic improvements are often short lived. Because balloon bronchoplasty stretches the airway circumferentially, the airway often returns to the original narrowed state over time. Instead, we recommend combining balloon bronchoplasty with radial incisions and steroid injections at the site of stenosis. Radial incisions allow tearing along the radial scores during dilation rather than mere circumferential stretching of the airway. Incisions are traditionally made at the 12 o ' clock, 8 o ' clock, and 4 o ' clock positions with an electrocautery knife or Nd:YAG laser. Injection of corticosteroids into the airway mucosa using a Wang needle at the sites of radial incisions may reduce in /uniFB02 ammation and prevent restenosis. 41\nSevere bronchial stenoses refractory to balloon bronchoplasty combined with radial incisions and steroid injections require stent placement (Fig 6). One study featuring 41 patients with bronchial stenosis demonstrated a mean survival of 82 months vs 22 months, respectively, in patients undergoing stent placement compared with those who underwent simple bronchoplasty. 42 We prefer the use of silicone stents for airway stenosis following lung transplantation.\nDepending on the location and speci /uniFB01 c contour of the stenosis, a tubular or customized silicone stent can be used. Silicone Y stents are comprised of a tracheal limb along with two bronchial limbs and can be used in stenoses proximal to the main carina or in situations in which bilateral main stem stenoses are present. The ultimate goal of silicone stent placement is to restore airway diameter and allow for airway remodeling by using the body ' s propensity to granulate. Although we agree that careful bronchoscopic surveillance of silicone stents is recommended every 4 to 6 weeks, no consensus exists on the duration of time that silicone stents should remain in the airways. The duration for stent placement ranges anywhere from 2 months to 1 year. The interval of time a stent should remain in the airways deserves further research with randomized controlled studies. In situations in which a silicone stent cannot easily be placed due to severe stenosis, selfexpanding metallic stents can be used to dilate the airway serially until a long-term silicone stent can be\nplaced (Fig 7). Although we agree that self-expanding metallic stents are effective in the treatment of severe anastomotic stenosis, they should be removed within 4 to 6 weeks of placement due to the potential for excessive granulation tissue formation, which can make stent extraction challenging.\nStent migration and granulation tissue formation are potential complications of stent placement and must be considered, particularly when using self-expanding metallic stents. A retrospective study of 17 cases demonstrated subjective and objective (FEV1) improvement following stent placement, with a complication rate of only 0.13 per patient per month. 35 The development of biodegradable stents has sparked interest in the treatment of airway stenosis, as they can absorb over time and are associated with a reduced risk of granulation tissue formation. Small studies featuring\nthe use of biodegradable stents show their promise as treatment options to overcome the limitation of current stent designs. 43\nA small subset of refractory bronchial stenosis cases requires surgical intervention. Such treatments include anastomotic reconstruction, sleeve resection with and without lobar resection, and rarely retransplantation. 44 Repeated lung transplantation accounts for 2% of all transplantations worldwide, but very few are performed for refractory airway complications. Therefore, a paucity of data on operative strategies and outcomes exists for this subgroup of patients undergoing retransplantation for airway complications. 45",

      "title": "Transplantation-Related Bronchomalacia",
      "content": "Bronchomalacia describes pathologic weakness of bronchial walls leading to an accentuation of normal airway narrowing on expiration. Although there is no de /uniFB01 nite consensus on the degree of narrowing that is considered pathologic, a criterion of > a 50% decrease in the luminal diameter on expiration has been widely accepted for the diagnosis of bronchomalacia (Fig 8). 46,47\nThe incidence of bronchomalacia following lung transplantation is not well documented, but a singlecenter study describes an incidence of approximately 1% to 4%. 48 In patients who have undergone lung transplantation, bronchomalacia can be classi /uniFB01 ed as either perianastomotic bronchomalacia or distal malacia. The former is found 1 cm proximal or distal to the bronchial anastomosis, whereas the latter is located more distally.\nThe mechanism underlying bronchomalacia in patients who have undergone lung transplantation is not well understood but has been associated with the presence of bronchiolitis obliterans. 49 In patients with tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) who have not undergone lung transplantation, autopsy studies have shown atrophy and reduction in the number of the longitudinal elastic /uniFB01 bers of the pars membranacea and ' fragmentation ' of the tracheal cartilage. 50,51 It is unclear if similar pathologic changes are present in patients who have undergone transplantation and have the diffuse form of bronchomalacia.\nPerianastomotic malacia typically presents within 4 months of transplantation. Symptoms are similar to those in patients who have not undergone transplantation and include cough, wheezing, dyspnea, sputum production, and recurrent respiratory\n[\n]\ninfections. Some patients may remain asymptomatic until a supervening secondary factor manifests, such as the development of infection or rejection.\nThe current gold standard for the diagnosis of airway malacia, both transplantation and nontransplantation related, is bronchoscopic visualization of the airway during forced expiration. 52 Numerous studies have assessed the utility of multidetector CT imaging in the diagnosis of TBM, but none has proved as sensitive as /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopy. 46 Majid et al 53 proposed a structured approach to assess the location and degree of expiratory collapse during /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopy using dynamic airway maneuvers for nontransplantation TBM. These maneuvers are performed with the patient under light sedation and require the patient to inhale and forcibly exhale when instructed. Based on the study by Majid et al, 53 visualization of posterior tracheal membrane bowing resulting in a > 50% reduction in airway diameter on forced expiration is associated with clinically relevant TBM that is often manifested by shortness of breath.\nWe consider the management of transplant-related bronchomalacia to mirror that of non-transplantrelated malacia (Fig 9). The decision to treat bronchomalacia depends on the severity of symptoms and the extent of airway collapse. Asymptomatic patients with mild disease may not require treatment but warrant continued observation. In patients with moderate collapse and functional impairment, treatment options include pulmonary hygiene, mucolytic agents, and noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation.\nIf the degree of malacia is severe, with functional impairment despite conservative medical therapy, we favor silicone stent placement. Silicone stents rapidly establish and maintain the patency of malacic airway segments during expiration. We recommend 9 to 12 months of in situ silicone stent placement to allow for adequate airway remodeling. If the location of the malacic segment and shape of the airway is not conducive to silicone stent placement, self-expanding metallic stents may provide better palliation. 54,55 We believe that the optimal duration of self-expanding metallic stent placement for malacia should be 4 to 6 weeks to avoid excessive granulation formation. Because of expected scarring following lung transplantation, surgical intervention for\nposttransplantation bronchomalacia would be extremely challenging and is not recommended.",

In intubated patients, limiting air /uniFB02 ow through the defect with low-tidal-volume ventilation and minimal positive end-expiratory pressure can expedite healing. Surgical options in appropriate patients include chronic open drainage, direct closure with /uniFB02 ap reinforcement, transsternal bronchial closure, or thoracoplasty. 56 We believe that patients not deemed candidates for surgical closure should be treated endoscopically with /uniFB01 brin glue for bronchopleural /uniFB01 stulas measuring 3 to 5 mm or metallic stent placement to cover more proximal large /uniFB01 stulas.\nBronchomediastinal /uniFB01 stulas typically present with mediastinal infection along with constitutional symptoms consistent with the systemic in /uniFB02 ammatory response syndrome.

      "content": "Anastomotic dehiscence is a complication of lung transplantation that is associated with high morbidity and mortality. 62,63 Dehiscence is thought to result from extreme mucosal necrosis with separation of the surgical anastomosis. 37,64-66 One case series reported some degree of dehiscence, including clinically insigni /uniFB01 cant cases, in up to 24% of patients. 22 Fortunately, severe dehiscence is rare, with an estimated incidence of less than 2%. 67\nThe risk factors for dehiscence are similar to those of other airway complications, including ischemia, surgical technique, high doses of perioperative steroids, acute rejection, infection, inadequate organ preservation, and immunosuppression. 19,25,36,65,67,68 A strong correlation between culture-proven Aspergillus colonization, even in the absence of active infection, and bronchial wall necrosis has been described. 24,36 The use of sirolimus, a rapamycin derivate, has also been associated with a high incidence of dehiscence if used early in the postoperative period. 69\nCommon presenting symptoms of anastomotic dehiscence include dyspnea, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, an inability to wean from mechanical ventilation, pneumomediastinum, or a persistent air leak in the early posttransplantation period. Other patients may present with infection and rapidly progressive sepsis.\nBronchoscopy is required to diagnose and adequately assess the severity of anastomotic dehiscence. A CT scan of the chest is a noninvasive modality for detection of airway dehiscence based on the test ' s high sensitivity and speci /uniFB01 city, but bronchoscopy is essential for diagnosis. 70 Our approach for the management of anastomotic dehiscence depends on the symptoms and the severity. Partial dehiscence is\noften treated conservatively with close bronchoscopic surveillance along with antibiotic therapy, both IV and inhaled. 67 Bronchoscopic therapies for severe dehiscence include the use of stents, cyanoacrylate glue, growth factors, and autologous platelet-derived wound-healing factor. 62,71 Successful management of severe dehiscence has been reported with the temporary placement of uncovered self-expanding metallic stents. 67,72 We agree with the use of uncovered self-expanding metallic stents for the treatment of clinically signi /uniFB01 cant dehiscence. The known adverse effect of excessive granulation tissue formation associated with self-expanding metallic stents is used to provide a platform for dehiscence healing and remodeling of the airway. We prefer uncovered self-expanding metallic stents to avoid bacterial colonization of the stent coating and to allow drainage of mediastinal and bronchial secretions while still allowing ventilation of involved lobes. Typically, self-expanding metallic stents are removed after 4 to 6 weeks to avoid excess growth of granulation tissue, which would making stent removal challenging. Extreme caution is required for the deployment and removal of self-expanding metallic stents due to the risk of creating a larger defect with stent manipulation.\nSurgical treatment options for anastomotic dehiscence include open repair for reanastomosis, /uniFB02 ap bronchoplasty, transplant pneumonectomy, or retransplantation. 36 Typically, surgical repair is reserved for severe cases or complete dehiscence. These surgical procedures are extremely risky and generally yield poor outcomes. 65",

Fungal infections occur in 15% to 35% of recipients after lung transplantation; Aspergillus species together with Candida species are responsible for > 80% of these infections. 74\nEffective strategies to prevent and counter posttransplantation infections include antifungal prophylaxis along with aggressive and early treatment with broad-spectrum therapy for organisms detected on bronchoscopy. A worldwide survey of 43 lung transplantation centers in 2002 revealed a practice of universal antifungal prophylaxis in the postoperative period in 69% of the centers, whereas 31% used aggressive treatment of fungal airway colonization, even in the absence of active infection.\nWe acknowledge that differentiating anastomotic infection from colonization can be dif /uniFB01 cult in the postlung transplantation population. Isolation of bacterial or fungal species should be based on biopsy samples obtained directly from the anastomosis. Further evidence supporting the use of antibiotics includes systemic symptoms of infection and the presence of anastomotic erythema or pseudomembrane formation.",

      "content": "Airway complications represent a signi /uniFB01 cant source of morbidity and potential mortality in lung transplant recipients. Although the incidence of airway complications is signi /uniFB01 cantly lower than other more common transplantation-related maladies such as chronic lung allograft dysfunction, they often represent a management conundrum for clinicians when they do supervene. Patients may be beset by recurrent hospitalizations and repeated procedures, which may profoundly affect the quality of life. Despite signi /uniFB01 cant progress in surgical technique, immunosuppressive strategies, and postoperative intensive care, the optimal management of airway complications post-lung transplantation has yet to be clearly de /uniFB01 ned. Myriad questions remain regarding the best approach to treat airway complications, providing fertile ground for future research (Table 2). Indeed, transplant physicians and interventional pulmonologists should focus jointly on\nhigh-quality research to avert and treat airway complications, thus improving the quality of life and survival of the growing population of lung transplant recipients.",
