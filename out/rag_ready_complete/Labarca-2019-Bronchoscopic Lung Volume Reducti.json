      "content": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) is a common condition associated with high morbidity and mortality. This condition includes two entities that frequently overlap: chronic bronchitis (chronic inflammation of the central airways) and emphysema (hyperinflation with decreased lung elasticity) [1].\nAlthough  several  pharmacological  treatments  exist, their effects are modest. A subgroup of patients with emphysema and hyperinflation  are  considered  candidates for lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS). This procedure carries a significant morbidity and mortality as well as high cost [2]. Less invasive procedures, such as endoscopic lung volume reduction (ELVR), have been developed during the last decade with promising results. ELVR with Zephyr ® valves has been recently approved by the FDA [3] and might provide the benefits seen with LVRS, but probably with lower morbidity and mortality. Endobronchial valves (EBVs) are one-way valves placed endoscopically in distal airways, reducing distal air flow into the targeted segmental bronchi, while permitting mucous and air movement into the proximal direction. This will cause target lobe volume reduction effectively by atelectasis in patients without evidence of collateral ventilation (CV) or with intact fissures [4, 5].\nPrevious meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated possible clinical benefits associated with multiple outcomes in patients with emphysema as compared to medical therapy with encouraging results [6]. However, such results were limited since only 3 RCTs were included [7-9]. We performed this systematic review and meta-analysis based on all available published RCTs to evaluate the overall efficacy and safety of  Zephyr ® valves  in  patients  with  severe  emphysema without CV.",

Information regarding literature search, baseline characteristics, risk of bias assessment, and concordance analysis between reviewers was included as qualitative synthesis.\nFor the quantitative analysis, pooled data was evaluated using a meta-analysis following the DerSimonian-Laird method with a random-effect model; if heterogeneity was nonsignificant, we used a fixed-effect model. Our outcomes were predefined as change in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) in % of predicted value following EBV intervention in patients with severe emphysema without  CV;  change  in  the  St  George's  Respiratory  Questionnaire (SGRQ) (total score); change in the 6-min walking test (6MWT) (in meters), and change in residual volume (RV) (in mL). As unit of time, we evaluated outcomes after 3 and 6 months, and 1 year after intervention. For safety analysis, we included data regarding relative risk (Relative risk (RR)) of both all-cause mortality and pneumothorax in both groups. In order to be able to calculate the absolute effect in studies  without  pneumothorax, we checked the baseline risk of pneumothorax in patients with emphysema based on the representative observational study.\nFor the meta-analysis, we evaluated continuous variables using mean difference (MD), while categorical variables were explored using a Relative risk (RR) measure. Heterogeneity between studies was evaluated using a visual inspection of forest plot and using an I 2 test. We considered an I 2 of > 50% as significant heterogeneity.\nWe also explored potential sources of heterogeneity in changes of FEV1 using a subgroup analysis including reported follow-up (3 or ≥ 6 months), emphysema distribution (heterogeneous or homo-\nSD, Standard deviation; BMI, body mass index; FEV1, forced expiratory volume in 1 s; TLC, total lung capacity; RV, residual volume; TLCO, total lung capacity of CO; mMRC, modified medical research council; CAT, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) assessment test; SGRQ, St George's Respiratory Questionnaire; 6MWD, 6-min walking distance; HRCT, high-resolution computed tomography; NR, not reported.\ngeneous),  and  comparator  between  trials  (SoC  or  sham  valve). Publication bias was explored through a visual inspection of funnel plot analysis. Asymmetry between studies was defined as publication bias.\nFinally, we created tables reporting the results of both efficacy and safety analysis. Quality of evidence was ranked by a GRADE panel (G.L. and F.K.) following the GRADE approach. For the meta-analysis and risk of bias assessment, we used RevMan version 5.3. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Tables and confidence of evidence were created using the GRADE pro software (Hamilton, ON, Canada) (www.gradepro.org).",

      "content": "The results of the current systematic review and metaanalysis  confirm  that  FEV1  improved  significantly  following Zephyr ® placement in patients with severe emphysema and without CV as measured by Chartis ® system. Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses have already been published on this topic, however, most of them included few studies and pooled data from bronchial valve trials with and without CV [16]. In addition, the meta-analyses included multiple studies which were very variable. Thus, the conclusions could provide a false impression about the efficacy of interventions in patients with severe emphysema, whereas the reality is that Zephyr ® valves  are  helpful  in  specific  carefully  selected  patients.\nRecently, van Geffen et al. [17] evaluated the efficacy of both LVRS and ELVR techniques. They explored multiple  interventions,  with  multiple  studies  pooling  data from different types of emphysema and fissure integrity assessment, among other variables. They concluded that either LVRS or ELVR are useful in patients with severe emphysema and hyperinflation and both EBV and LVRS reported  better  results  than  other  techniques,  without properly addressing the population that might benefit the most [17]. The principal contribution of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to explore Zephyr ® valves as intervention and included subgroup analyses to explore the impact of relevant predictors on major outcomes in order to identify potential patient populations.\nThese results correlate with changes in regional lung volume,  suggesting  that  the  mechanisms  for  improvement and better results are associated with a redirection\nof the inspired air to less diseased areas of the lung, improving respiratory function and gas exchange [18]. Furthermore, this study suggests that FEV1 improved significantly in patients with homogenous as well as heterogeneous  emphysema,  albeit  a  higher  FEV1  improvement was seen in heterogeneous disease.\nSuch a finding implicates the importance of CV regardless of emphysema quantification on chest imaging. According to the VENT trial, patients without intact fissures are not good candidates for EBV treatment. In addition, our analysis suggests that in appropriately selected patients, this procedure improves lung function up to a similar magnitude to those seen with LVRS, but with less morbidity and mortality. Pooled results showed an improvement in the predicted FEV1 (%) of 17.36%, exceeding the minimally clinically important difference of 10%. Quality of evidence was rated as 'moderate' due to risk of bias from included studies, especially bias due to a lack of blinding. We do not downgrade by inconsistency (heterogeneity)  between  the  populations  included  in  those studies due to two potential explanations for high heterogeneity:  (1)  emphysema distribution and (2) follow-up time, both findings from our subgroup analysis.\nRegarding the subgroup analysis, we found a believable subgroup effect due to a previous definition of the subgroups, a statistical significance in intergroup analysis, and both large effect and consistency between studies [19].\nBased on the results of the current systematic review and meta-analysis, the current evidence suggests that patients with severe emphysema and hyperinflation without CV, regardless of emphysema using Chartis ® system, will benefit from Zephyr ® placement and should be offered this option if no other contraindications exist. Despite the increased change in FEV1 of up to 26% reported in the analysis of heterogeneous distribution measure by Chartis ® , we could not find any explanation for residual heterogeneity in this group. This greater response in these subgroups supports the importance of adequate patient selection and the use of Chartis ® or high-resolution CT as tools in optimizing the evaluation of candidates to this technique, and better results were found in patients who received Zephyr ® treatment with high emphysema heterogeneity and with intact fissures [20].\nWe  also  found  a  significant  improvement  after  the procedure in RV, 6MWT, and the SGRQ. This could be explained by the reduction of the most severely diseased lung target along with an expansion of the more viable, less  emphysematous  lung,  resulting  in  substantial  improvements in lung mechanics and gas exchange [21, 22].\nAccording to our findings, the risk of pneumothorax is increased 5 times in comparison with control groups, independently of emphysema distribution; due to a low prevalence in the control groups, we estimate the risk of pneumothorax in the populations with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema,  based  on  data  published  by  Hobbs  and  colleagues using data from COPDGene, where the odds ratio of pneumothorax was 1.04 (CI, 1.03-1.06) [23]. However, previous  analyses  showed  better  outcomes  in  patients with pneumothorax as compared to no pneumothorax, and the occurrence of this event does not have a negative impact on the clinical outcomes of these patients [24].\nOur  meta-analysis  did  not  find  an  improvement  in survival in these patients. However, a previous study of 19 patients with heterogeneous emphysema and a follow-up of 10 years demonstrated increased survival in patients where target lung volume reduction was achieved after Zephyr ® placement  [25].  This  suggests  that  atelectasis might be a predictor of survival probably due to improvement in lung mechanics and better gas exchange [26].\nThis analysis has several limitations. All included trials reported a relatively short follow-up period ranging between 3 and 12 months, making it difficult to assess the long-term benefits and adverse consequences of Zephyr ® placement. According to our findings, we found a subgroup  difference  between  trials  with  a  short  follow-up compared to 6 months or more (STELVIO: 6 months, and LIBERATE: 12 months). Moreover, two trials [8, 12] with 6 or more months' follow-up reported 0% heterogeneity, compared with a short follow-up and 89% heterogeneity; this finding suggest a consistency change in FEV1 between 6 and 12 months. Another subgroup was defined by the type of comparator, we found only 1 trial that used sham valves versus 4 that used SoC; the subgroup analysis according  to  this  variable  found  significant  intergroup differences  regarding  major  outcomes  such  as  FEV1, 6MWT, and RV. This point should be considered in further trials.\nFinally, studies with long-term follow-ups are needed to understand the efficacy and safety of this procedure as\nwell as a potential survival benefit. Furthermore, the results of the studies reported high confidence intervals for multiple outcomes (FEV1, SGRQ, and 6MWT) that must also be taken into consideration for future trials.",
