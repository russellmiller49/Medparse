This kit  generally  includes  a  number  15  surgical  scalpel  blade,  an  introducer needle, a guidewire, a small tracheal dilator, a protective sheath, a single-stage progressive tracheal dilator, a tracheal loading trocar, and a small slip-tip syringe.\nThe size of the tracheostomy tube selected should be appropriate for the patient. Percutaneous tracheostomy kits are designed to be used with a specialized tracheostomy tube that loads onto a dilator. In practice, however, any tracheostomy tube can be inserted in a percutaneous fashion. A thin, flexible tracheostomy tube is useful because it maximizes the diameter of the airway while minimizing pressure on the tracheal wall.",

      "title": "Procedure",
      "content": "Before starting the procedure, the team should take a time-out to verify the patient's identity and the procedure to be performed. After the time-out, the patient's nurse should administer a short-acting paralytic agent and, if necessary, additional sedation. Inadequate paralysis increases the risk of inadvertent extubation when the oral endotracheal tube is being manipulated. After administering the agent, the nurse should step out of the room to minimize exposure but should be immediately available and ready to reenter the room if assistance is needed.\nSterilize and drape the anterior neck, making sure that the draping will allow easy access to the oral endotracheal tube. Make a 2-to-3-cm vertical incision in the neck that directly overlies the trachea and is below the cricoid cartilage. Bluntly dissect the pretracheal tissue with a dissecting tool until the trachea is palpable. In patients who require therapeutic anticoagulation or in whom there is any risk of bleeding, it may be advisable to place a purse-string suture around the tracheostomy incision. The purse-string suture is placed but not tied during this step. It will be tied to provide additional hemostatic control once the tracheostomy tube has been inserted. The suture is generally removed on the second postoperative day if there is no evidence of bleeding. The tracheostomy tube itself should not be sutured in place. Suturing a tracheostomy tube results in skin ulceration and does not prevent inadvertent decannulation.\nAsk  the  respiratory  therapist  to  induce  apnea  by  placing  the  ventilator  on standby. Disconnect the oral endotracheal tube from the ventilator circuit and attach a bronchoscope adaptor to the tube. Insert the bronchoscope into the adaptor, reconnect the circuit, and resume ventilation. Advance the bronchoscope into the airway. Briefly survey the trachea and clear any obstructing secretions.\nOnce all team members are ready to proceed, advance the bronchoscope into the oral endotracheal tube until the camera is aligned with the end of the tube. At that point, the respiratory therapist should again induce apnea and then deflate the  tube  cuff.  The  respiratory  therapist  and  the  bronchoscopist  together  then slowly withdraw the tube and the bronchoscope simultaneously until the subglottic  landmarks are visible.  Palpation  of  the  anterior  trachea  by  the  surgeon  can facilitate identification of these landmarks. Some practitioners use transillumination (i.e., visualization of the bronchoscopic light through the skin) to facilitate the positioning of the tube.\nThe bronchoscope is kept within the oral endotracheal tube at all times to ensure control of the airway. Precise communication and coordinated movement between the respiratory therapist and bronchoscopist are crucial to the prevention of accidental extubation.\nOnce the oral endotracheal tube has been withdrawn to an appropriate location, perform the tracheostomy, using the Seldinger technique. Insert the introducer needle through the anterior wall of the trachea under direct bronchoscopic visualization. The needle should be inserted at the level of the second tracheal ring, perpendicular to the trachea, with the bevel facing down. Placement of the needle bevel in this downward position will help to direct the guidewire into the distal trachea. It is critical to avoid damaging the balloon on the oral endotracheal tube. In the event that the patient's condition becomes clinically unstable or there is difficulty performing the tracheostomy, as long as the balloon is intact, the oral endotracheal tube is simply advanced to its original location and normal ventilation is resumed. Additional supplies or personnel can be gathered. If the balloon is compromised, so too is the ability to provide positive pressure ventilation. A new airway must be expeditiously established by means of either a tracheostomy or oral endotracheal intubation with an intact tube.\nDownloaded from nejm.org at NMC San Diego on August 6, 2025.\nFeed the guidewire through the needle and visualize it while advancing it distally toward the carina. Advance the wire slightly beyond the carina (Fig. 2). Remove the needle over the wire, keeping the wire in place within the trachea at all times. Advance the small tracheal dilator over the wire to dilate the tract. Remove the  small  tracheal  dilator  and,  with  the  protective  sheath  loaded,  advance  the single-stage progressive dilator over the wire (Fig. 3). Remove the progressive dilator, keeping the wire and the protective sheath in place. (Markings on the side of the progressive dilator guide the depth to which it is inserted.) Next, insert an appropriately sized tracheostomy tube directly into the trachea over the wire and protective sheath. If using a flexible tracheostomy tube, insert the tube with the curve directed toward the patient's head. Once the tube in the patient's trachea is visualized, rotate the tube 180 degrees. This will position the tube in its normal orientation and prevent it from creating a pretracheal plane. Alternatively, a nonflexible tracheostomy tube can be loaded onto an insertion trocar and advanced over the wire and the protective sheath into the trachea.\nOnce the tube is in place, remove the protective sheath, wire, and trocar (if used), inflate the tracheostomy cuff, connect the circuit to the tracheostomy tube, and resume ventilation. The presence of end-tidal carbon dioxide confirms placement in the airway. Alternatively, the bronchoscope can be reinserted through the tracheostomy tube to visually confirm placement within the airway. The position of the tracheostomy should be confirmed with the patient's head in flexion and extension. Only then should the oral endotracheal tube be removed.\nOnce satisfactory placement is confirmed, secure the tracheostomy tube with a tracheostomy collar. If a purse-string suture was placed, tie down the suture to close the skin incision around the tracheostomy. Once the patient is appropriately ventilated through a secured tracheostomy tube, the oral endotracheal tube may be removed.",

      "content": "The most serious procedural risk associated with endotracheal intubation is loss of the airway. This typically occurs in one of two ways: the patient coughs during manipulation of the endotracheal tube or the balloon on the tube is damaged. Adequate neuromuscular paralysis should prevent the patient from coughing. An intact balloon is critical to the safety of the procedure. If the patient's condition becomes unstable or if there is difficulty placing the tracheostomy, the oral endotracheal tube should be advanced to its original location and ventilation resumed. If  the  balloon  is  compromised,  the  provision  of  positive  pressure  ventilation  is compromised. Either a new airway must be established expeditiously by creating a tracheostomy or by replacing the compromised endotracheal tube with an intact tube through oral endotracheal intubation.",

Pulmonary hygiene, ventilator weaning, and eventual decannulation should be performed in accordance with institutional guidelines and the clinical status of the patient. Maturation of the tracheal stoma occurs after approximately 7 days, at which time the tracheostomy tube may be replaced or downsized, depending on the clinical needs of the patient.

      "title": "Complications",
      "content": "Early complications after placement of a tracheostomy tube include bleeding and obstruction  or  dislodgement  of  the  tracheostomy  tube. 2 Bleeding  is  the  most common complication, but it is usually self-limited or can be controlled with the use of measures such as the application of pressure or the use of hemostatic agents. The purse-string method described above may help to control bleeding from the skin.\nInadvertent decannulation and obstruction of the tracheostomy tube are rare, but should they occur, both can be managed by securing the airway through oral endotracheal intubation. If obstruction of the tube cannot be cleared with standard suctioning techniques or if the tube becomes dislodged, the airway should be secured by means of orotracheal intubation; insertion of a new tracheostomy tube through a tract that has not fully matured should not be attempted.\nLate complications after tracheostomy include tracheoinnominate fistula, tracheoesophageal fistula, and tracheal stenosis. 4 The development of fistulas is a rare complication that requires surgical consultation. Tracheoinnominate fistulas are rare and life-threatening. If a fistula is suspected, immediate operative repair must be performed, as it affords the only chance of survival. 5  Tracheoesophageal fistula typically occurs in patients with an esophageal foreign body, such as a feeding tube. 4 Operative repair is indicated after the patient's critical illness has resolved. Tracheal stenosis can occur anywhere along the trachea, from the tracheal stoma to the cuff of the tracheostomy tube. Stomal stenosis results from the trauma of tube insertion or excessive movement at the entry site. Cuff stenosis is related to mucosal ischemic injury from high cuff pressures. Tracheal dilation is palliative; definitive treatment requires resection and reconstruction. 6",
