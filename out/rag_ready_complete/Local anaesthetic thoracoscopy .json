      "title": "Introduction",
      "content": "Local anaesthetic thoracoscopy (LAT), otherwise known as medical thoracoscopy or pleuroscopy, is the preferred method for investigating an undiagnosed exudative pleural effusion [1]. It offers a multi-modality approach: a therapeutic approach where pleural fluid can be drained to relieve symptoms, a diagnostic approach where abnormal areas of parietal pleura can be directly visualised and targeted for biopsy, and a preventative approach with the ability to perform interventions such as pleurodesis and indwelling pleural catheter insertion for fluid control [2]. The diagnostic performance of LAT is superior to image guided biopsy, with a diagnostic yield of over 90% [1,2]. Furthermore, LAT is safe, with retrospective data demonstrating a 1.8% major complication rate and mortality rate of 0.3% [3].\nOnly 11 centres in the United Kingdom (UK) were known to offer a LAT service in 1999. This number has steadily increased, with 17 centres identified in 2004, 37 in 2009 and 49 in 2017 [4 -6].  LAT can be performed under sedation, with reduced operating room time, shorter hospital stays, lower perioperative mortality and reduced costs when compared to the more traditionally used video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) [7].\nDespite its popularity and now established nature, there are no agreed thoracoscopy standards in the UK, leading to a significant variability in practice between individual centres [5]. This concern was raised nearly 20 years ago but a solution is yet to be agreed [6].  A survey of LAT practice in 2017 demonstrated variations, particularly in pre-procedural preparation, the use of prophylactic antibiotics, the choice of sedation agents and duration of omission of antiplatelet agents, reflecting a lack of robust evidence and standards. The survey did however demonstrate similarities in equipment used and technical approaches, providing a useful overview of UK practice [5]. We aimed to repeat this survey to investigate whether UK practice has changed since 2017 and to highlight areas to be addressed in any future standards.",

      "title": "Discussion",
      "content": "This survey provides an up to date account of LAT practice in the UK, highlighting recent changes in practice and on-going variation across centres.\nThere has been a drop in utilising LAT as the first-line investigation for an exudative pleural effusion, following a non-diagnostic cytology result. In the 2017 survey 95% of centres preferred LAT as the first line investigation, compared with 87% from our current survey. This is due to 3 centres adopting US guided pleural biopsy as the preferred investigation, of which two previously utilised LAT in the 2017 survey, the other centre did not participate in the 2017 survey. Despite this, there has been an increase in the median number of trained LAT practitioners from 2 to 3 [5].\nDay case provision of LAT has increased since 2017. Previously 76% of centres routinely admitted patients, falling to 51% in this survey [5]. This could be due to increasing NHS bed pressures in the post-COVID era and increasing acceptance of ambulatory and day case management of pleural disease. The use of talc pleurodesis may influence the decision to admit a patient, however some UK centres are now performing talc poudrage and IPC as a day case procedure. [8,9].\nSince 2017 there has been an increase in centres exclusively using semi-rigid scopes, increasing from 8% in 2017 to 22% in our current survey [5]. The reason for their popularity is not clear, though given most respiratory physicians will be experienced with flexible bronchoscopes, the learning curve may not be as steep [3].  It is worth noting that the diagnostic yield between semi-rigid and rigid thoracoscopes is comparable, and so the use of either type is probably operator dependent [3].\nThere have also been changing trends in post procedural care. Fewer centres routinely perform pleurodesis, 70 % in the current survey compared to 84% in 2017. This could be due to more centres opting for IPC insertion over talc pleurodesis, as IPC use has steadily increased in the UK over the last decade [10]. Furthermore, the threshold is now lower for choosing thoracoscopy for exploration of the pleural cavity and biopsies, in the diagnostic pathway of undiagnosed exudative pleural effusions [1]. This is a culture change from thoracoscopy largely being performed in those with a high clinical suspicion of pleural malignancy. Therefore, where a non-malignant process is considered, practitioners may not be keen to undertake talc pleurodesis.\nThere remains variation, particularly in pre-procedural preparation. The routine use of antibiotics, fluids and premedication differed between centres. There appeared to be uniformity in the approach towards intravenous sedation, with all but 2 centres routinely offering sedation. Most centres utilise combination midazolam and opioids, in a similar approach to sedation used for bronchoscopy. However, it is not clear from our survey what doses of opioids are utilised and to what extent these are utilised for their analgesic effect.\nMost centres do not have SOPs in place for potential complications of LAT. Whilst many centres will have staff competent to recognise and manage complications, the lack of SOPs could lead to adverse events as most centres do not have onsite cardiothoracic support. Whilst the risk of major complication from LAT is low [3], the potential for harm is high given its invasive nature. Our survey has not captured complication rates, and there are no centralised processes for reporting and auditing this information.\nThe weaknesses of this study include those that are inherent to any survey, such as recall bias of the respondents and sampling bias. One of the main limitations of this survey is the unknown number of centres performing LAT in the UK.  Therefore, it is not clear what proportion of UK centres our data represents. However, even accepting this sampling bias, we have identified important variations in practice that require addressing. The survey was distributed through a national society and cascaded via loco-regional pleural networks, which introduces a degree of selection bias. Reminders were sent to increase response rates, and all attempts made to capture as many centres doing thoracoscopy as possible. Furthermore, as mentioned above, given this was a self-reported survey, there is a degree of subjectivity of the responses and the potential for recall bias.",

      "content": "There is ongoing wide variation in practice amongst centres undertaking LAT in the UK; we suggest two approaches to address this. Firstly, the development of a central database for the reporting of LAT procedures performed would be crucial for auditing practice and assessing complications, in line with other specialities performing invasive procedures [11].  The high proportion of centres already having access to a local database of LAT procedures suggests this should be achievable on a national scale. Secondly, the development of national or international standards around LAT would help standardise practice, in line with other national guideline committees [12]. This survey will form the basis of the relevant applications to national and international respiratory societies.",
