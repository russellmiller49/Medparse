      "title": "Introduction",
      "content": "Surgical resection is well established as a treatment of localized cancers, including lung cancer. A fundamental principle of cancer surgery is complete resection of the tumor with a margin of normal tissue to ensure that no residual tumor remains. This is not only logical but also supported by decades of experience revealing high cure rates for many localized cancers when this is achieved. Re /uniFB02 ecting this, the residual tumor (R) classi/uniFB01 cation of resection completeness has been well established as a complement to the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation of the anatomic extent of cancer since the /uniFB01 rst edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging manual published in 1977. 1 The traditional R-classi /uniFB01 cation designates as R0 a complete resection, as R1 a macroscopically complete resection with microscopic tumor at the surgical margin, and as R2 a resection that leaves gross tumor behind.\nIncreasing knowledge naturally leads to questions about /uniFB01 ner details -the R-classi /uniFB01 cation for lung cancer is no exception. The seventh edition of TNM classi /uniFB01 cation of lung cancer marked a major upgrade through the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) initiative to create an unprecedented large database, an international multidisciplinary expert panel (the Staging and Prognostic Factors Committee, SPFC), and extensive analysis to provide a solid basis for revisions in TNM classi /uniFB01 cation. 2 This included re /uniFB01 nements of the R-classi /uniFB01 cation, such as designation of a resection in the face of a malignant pleural effusion as R1, a focus on extracapsular extension of involved lymph nodes as a potential source of residual disease, and proposal of an ' uncertain ' R category. This new category included limited node evaluation or /uniFB01 nding involvement of the highest resected lymph node, designated as R0(un), and\ncarcinoma in situ (CIS) at the bronchial margin Odds ratio (or) /uniFB01 nding tumor cells in a pleural lavage (performed despite the absence of an effusion), designated respectively as R1(is) or R1(cy þ ). 3\nAs with the seventh and eighth editions of TNM classi /uniFB01 cation of lung cancer, the IASLC SPFC has been tasked with creating proposals for re /uniFB01 nements for the ninth edition. This effort included an R-subcommittee, involving an international multidisciplinary group. This paper describes the proposals for R-classi /uniFB01 cation for the ninth edition. Speci /uniFB01 cally, this paper provides a review and analysis of the available evidence regarding the Rclassi /uniFB01 cation and potential re /uniFB01 nements of the descriptors of the R categories. Additional work by the Rsubcommittee will be published elsewhere.",

      "content": "To inform potential revisions to the R-classi /uniFB01 cation, a review of the available pertinent literature was undertaken. This involved the PubMed database and Englishlanguage articles using search terms related to lung cancer, surgery, completeness of resection, residual tumor, and resection margins. In addition, reference lists of relevant papers and reviews were assessed.\nPapers were identi /uniFB01 ed for inclusion if they provided information about the prognostic impact of the existing R categories and descriptors -speci /uniFB01 cally to evaluate between-category discrimination and within-category homogeneity. The inherent problem that prognosis is determined by multiple factors is accentuated when evaluating the R-status. There are clearly tumor-related differences associated with resection completeness and patient- and setting-related factors that can limit the ability to achieve a complete resection. Therefore, this review focused on reports that adjusted for at least some confounders. Study interpretation must also consider potential residual confounding; con /uniFB01 dence that an observed difference is due to the question of interest (i.e., R-status) in a nonrandomized comparison is undermined by potential confounders that were not accounted for. It was deemed best to focus on studies with at least 100 patients, as the number of confounders that can be included and the strength of multivariate adjustment are diminished when the number of outcome events is limited. Inclusion criteria for each table are listed in the respective legends.\nIn addition, the R-subcommittee considered areas of ambiguitythat haveemerged during implementationofthe eighth edition de /uniFB01 nitions. Areas for clari /uniFB01 cation stem in part from a survey conducted by the R-subcommittee, from assessing how the R-classi /uniFB01 cation has been understood in published studies, and from a critical reassessment of the wording in the eighth edition classi /uniFB01 cation. Results of the R-classi /uniFB01 cation survey are the topic of a separate paper.\nTheproposedrevisionswerereviewedanddiscussedin the R-subcommittee and the SPFC steering committee. A re /uniFB01 ned document was then reviewed and approved by the entire SPFC according to the standard process of the SPFC.",

      "content": "De /uniFB01 nitions. The AJCC/Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) classi /uniFB01 cation system de /uniFB01 nes R0 as a complete resection, R1 as a microscopically positive resection margin, and R2 as gross unresected tumor remaining. 4,5 Speci /uniFB01 cally for lung cancer, the IASLC and the UICC additionally recognize an uncertain resection category, 3,4,6 de /uniFB01 ned as resections that are microscopically and macroscopically complete but have potentially concerning features, that is, (1) a limited lymph node assessment was performed, (2) the highest node removed is involved, (3) CIS is found at the bronchial resection margin, and (4) a pleural lavage was performed and result was found to be cytologically positive. 3,6,7 The /uniFB01 rst two descriptors are designated as R0(un). The latter two are designated as R1(is) and R1(cy þ ) -because UICC de /uniFB01 nes these situations as R1 8 but with the addition of (is) and (cy þ ) to distinguish them from a standard microscopically positive margin or malignant pleural effusion. These two descriptors are referred to in this paper as R1(un); the four scenarios are collectively referred to as R(un).\nAt the time of resection, IASLC has recommended a minimum assessment of six nodes/station; this should include the subcarinal station, at least two other mediastinal nodes/station, and three nodes/station from the\nhilum or other N1 locations. 6 The eighth edition IASLC recommendation is not speci /uniFB01 c regarding nodes versus node stations, and presumably both preoperative and intraoperative assessments count (although not explicitly stated).\nValidation. The overall survival (OS) of patients in the R(un) category consistently falls in-between that of R0 and R1,2 cohorts (Table 1, Fig. 1). 9 -15 In all studies, the uncertain category included all four uncertain descriptors. The OS differences were maintained after multivariate adjustment for potential confounders, which included tumor-related and demographic factors in all studies, and frequently also comorbidities 10,11,13,14 and/or treatment-related factors (e.g., adjuvant therapy, lobectomy versus wedge resection). 9 -11,13 Subset analyses in particular cohorts (N category, stage) maintained consistent differences. Furthermore, taken together, the four validation studies reveal that the ordering and statistical differences between the R categories are generally consistent across various geographic regions and time periods. In addition, a multivariate analysis found statistical differences in OS and recurrence-free survival (RFS) by R categories in 910 stage III-N2 patients who underwent neoadjuvant therapy before resection. 16\nOnly two studies noted no statistically signi /uniFB01 cant difference between the R0 and R(un) cohorts although ordering consistent with other studies was maintained. One involved an unadjusted analysis of a prospective cohort from 1993 to 1997 (not included in Table 1). 15 In the other study, an unadjusted statistically signi /uniFB01 cant",

The R2 cohort in all studies is small; presumably, imaging technology makes it unusual to encounter unexpected unresectable tumor.",

      "title": "Speci /uniFB01 c R(un) Descriptors",
      "content": "R0(un) -Limited Node Assessment. There is a discrepancy between the prevalence of limited node\nassessment and how well this descriptor has been studied. In Table 1, the vast majority of R(un) resections in most studies were classi /uniFB01 ed as such because of a limited node assessment. The consistent ordering and statistical difference in OS support retention of this descriptor of R0(un). In all studies, the IASLC de /uniFB01 nition of adequate assessment was interpreted as pertaining to node stations (not the number of discrete nodes).\nFew studies have focused speci /uniFB01 cally on the impact of the extent of node assessment (Table 2). 10,18 One study found incrementally lower survival as the degree of node assessment diminishes (Fig. 2). 10 The OS differences are statistically signi /uniFB01 cant after multivariate adjustment between patients who underwent a fully compliant node assessment (R0), a partially compliant assessment (at least one mediastinal station sampled), no node assessment (NX), and an incomplete resection (R1,2); a further group with only N1 nodes assessed falls in-between the partially compliant and NX cohorts, although the differences are not statistically signi /uniFB01 cant. In contrast, another study found a trend toward better survival with more limited node assessment, but differences in adjusted OS rates were not statistically signi /uniFB01 -cant between patients who underwent a completely compliant node assessment (R0), a partially compliant assessment (at least one mediastinal station was\nSurvival, Mo\nTimo (Year)\nsampled in > 90%), and no node assessment (NX). 18 The latter study involved an increasing proportion of cI tumors and lepidic tumors in the partially compliant and NX cohorts. Unfortunately, only total size was collected, leaving the proportion of ground-glass tumors unclear, and hampering multivariate adjustment for T size. The study noted no differences by degree of node assessment\nin subgroup analyses involving adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) or minimally invasive adenocarcinoma, pIA1 and pIA2 tumors; however, among pIA3 tumors, better OS was observed when patients underwent fully compliant versus partially compliant node assessment.\nThese /uniFB01 ndings suggest that although there is general support for the six-station node assessment R0(un)\nInclusion criteria: Studies comparing the IASLC R0(un) limited node assessment descriptor versus other R categories, published from 2000 to 2023, with at least 100 patients total, and using a method of adjustment for confounders.

In addition, it seems prudent to clarify that the de /uniFB01 nition refers to node stations (not nodes); this re /uniFB02 ects how the descriptor has been interpreted around the world for almost two decades.\nR0(un) - Highest Node Station Involvement. Studies addressing involvement of the highest node removed have used the highest node station assessed (most cephalad) as a surrogate. Among N2-positive cases, data are con /uniFB02 icting regarding a survival difference among cohorts with versus without highest node station involvement -that is, R0(un) versus R0 (Table 3). 9,10,12,14,19 -21 No clear reason for the discrepancy is apparent. All studies involved some adjustment for potential confounders. Results do not correlate with adjustment for the N2 subcategories; only one study adjusted for comorbidities. 14\nOne study 20 explored a de /uniFB01 nition of ' most distant ' node involvement (e.g., station 9) following an earlier suggestion. 15 No difference was noted between R0 and R0(un) as de /uniFB01 ned by either highest or most distant node involvement in multivariate analyses of N2 tumors. 20 Another study explored laterality and found similar signi /uniFB01 cant adjusted differences between R0 versus R0(un) cohorts among right- and left-sided tumors, using R2 and L4, respectively, as the de /uniFB01 nition of the highest station. 19\nUnrecognized factors seem to be contributing to the con /uniFB02 icting results; further study is warranted. Nevertheless, it seems reasonable to include highest station involvement as an R0(un) descriptor. Furthermore,\nde /uniFB01 ning the descriptor as highest station instead of highest individual node is practical and re /uniFB02 ects how data are collected.\nR1(is) - Carcinoma In Situ at the Bronchial Margin. CIS at the bronchial resection margin is reported infrequently. A systematic SPFC review in 2011 found 136 cases, with almost all patients diagnosed 20 to 40 years ago, and limited availability of details. 22 The incidence of CIS was 0.9%. Little additional data have emerged since then. The IASLC 1999 -2010 database contained 13 cases. 12 The IASLC ninth edition database was not assessed regarding CIS in time for this review. The most informative contemporary study involves 18 patients with bronchial margin CIS [R1(is)] and 42 with extramucosal microscopic residual cancer at the bronchial margin (R1). 23\nStump recurrences are rare after R1(is) resection (6% at 5 years in the recent study). 23 This is corroborated by others, although less speci /uniFB01 cally, 22,24 and is consistent with studies revealing that CIS may regress Odds ratio (or) may never progress in a substantial portion of cases. 25 Adjuvant radiotherapy was often administered in R1(is) cases, but the impact is unclear. Some studies report a higher rate of death from radiation toxicity than from cancer recurrence. 26,27\nSurveillance studies of untreated preinvasive endobronchial lesions provide additional evidence. Moderate interand intra-observer variability in classi /uniFB01 cation of preinvasive squamous bronchial lesions (degrees of dysplasia versus CIS) suggests some uncertainty. 28 In addition, a prospective study noted sustained regression in 63% of foci of severe dysplasia and regression in 31%",

A contemporary study noted no difference in OS by multivariate analysis for patients undergoing R1(is) versus either R0 or R1 resections with microscopic invasive cancer at the bronchial margin, analyzed separately for stage I -II and stage III tumors. 23 The sample size limits the certainty of this observation.\nIn conclusion, CIS at the bronchial margin is rare but has a good prognosis. It is intuitively dif /uniFB01 cult to ignore clear demonstration of CIS at the margin. Nevertheless, lack of progression and regression of bronchial CIS is well documented, making the impact unclear. It is reasonable to designate this as an R1(un) descriptor.\nR1(cy D ) -Positive Pleural Lavage Cytology. Pleural lavage cytology has been studied frequently, especially in Japan; a 2016 meta-analysis included 28 studies and more than 20,000 patients worldwide. 34 Pleural lavage cytology result is positive in approximately 5% of patients. 35 -40 Several meta-analyses have consistently found that positive cytology result is associated with lower OS and higher recurrence. 34,41 Nevertheless, metaanalyses of nonrandomized comparisons obscure the impact of confounders. 42\nLarge multivariate studies involving routine pleural lavage report that positive cytology result is independently associated with lower OS and RFS with few exceptions (versus negative cytology result, Table 4). 35 -40,43 -50 Most studies have adjusted for tumor-related factors (positive lavage cytology result increases with greater anatomic\nInclusion criteria: Studies comparing the IASLC R1(cy þ ) positive pleural lavage descriptor versus other R categories, published from 2000 to 2023, with at least 500 patients total, and using a method of adjustment for confounders.

Although the incidence is lower, R1(cy þ ) is found even in stage pI tumors. Most studies involve careful stage evaluation by imaging and node dissection. The data from multivariate-adjusted studies suggest an impact of R1(cy þ ) on long-term outcomes in stage I tumors, but this is less certain.\nMost studies performed lavage before any lung manipulation. A few studies have assessed lavage cytology pre- and post-resection, 36,45,48 and found that in approximately half of cases with positive pre-resection cytology result, the post-resection lavage result is negative, and vice versa (Supplementary Fig. 1). 36,45,48 These studies have also suggested that prognosis correlates more strongly and consistently with postthan preresection lavage. 36,45,48\nIn a large multicenter study, the 5-year OS for patients without and with positive cytology result, respectively, was 77% and 54% for stage pI, 50% and 29% for stage pII, and 35% and 21% for pIII ( /uniFB01 fth/sixth edition TNM). 37 Positive lavage cytology result clearly\nhas an impact on outcomes, but it does not indicate that resection is futile. Several studies have also compared R0 and R1(cy þ ) cases with patients with pleural dissemination who underwent resection (Fig. 3). 39,44,46,47 These have revealed that outcomes for R1(cy þ ) cohorts fall inbetween R0 cohorts and patients with pleural dissemination undergoing resection (R1). Among patients with pleural dissemination who underwent resection, approximately two-thirds had pleural nodules and onethird a malignant pleural effusion. These studies provide the best available comparison to R1,2 resections; no studies have compared R1(cy þ ) and general R1,2 resection cohorts.\nPositive lavage cytology result is associated with a higher risk of recurrence (approximately twofold overall, approximately twofold for distant, approximately /uniFB01 vefold for pleural recurrence; rates not adjusted for potential confounders). 34,35,41 The pleural recurrence rate is 15% to 20% versus 2% to 3%, respectively, after R1(cy þ ) versus R0 resections in two meta-analyses. In addition, pleural recurrences are involved in approximately 30% of all recurrences after R1(cy þ ) resection. 34,41 A small study (n ¼ 17) of intrapleural chemotherapy for R1(cy þ ) cases suggested a bene /uniFB01 t. 51\nNevertheless, a randomized controlled trial (n ¼ 49, closed prematurely due to poor accrual) of intrapleural chemotherapy for cytology-positive cases found no difference in OS but a dramatic reduction in pleural recurrences. 52\nIn summary, there is substantial evidence that positive pleural lavage cytology result is associated with worse survival than R0 resection and consistent evidence that outcomes fall in-between R0 resections and patients with pleural dissemination who underwent resection. Positive pleural lavage result is associated with a higher risk of pleural recurrence, but this occurs in a minority of patients. Classi /uniFB01 cation of R1(cy þ ) as an R(un) descriptor is appropriate. If no lavage was performed, the R1(cy þ ) descriptor does not apply.",

      "content": "Nodes. In the seventh and eighth edition manuals, extranodal extension of involved lymph nodes was not clearly de /uniFB01 ned. 3,6 This feature is mentioned both under microscopic- and macroscopic-positive margin headings, suggesting extranodal extension merely refers to the surgical margin around a resected node or node packet. Nevertheless, the speci /uniFB01 c mention of extracapsular extension implies that it is different than other resection margins.\nStudies addressing this topic do not mention whether extranodal extension was present at a resection margin or contained within a packet of surrounding normal\nInclusion criteria: Studies comparing the R1 microscopically positive margin descriptor versus other R categories, published from 2000 to 2023, with at least 500 patients total, and using a method of adjustment for confounders or reporting results strati /uniFB01 ed by stage.

Therefore, this paper assesses whether extracapsular extension (without information on the surrounding margin) has prognostic implications similar to a microscopically positive margin. Cases of direct primary tumor invasion of an adjacent node are excluded.\nStudies evaluating extranodal extension reveal mixed results (Table 6). 10,55 -61 The largest study suggests distinctly worse outcomes among resections with versus without extranodal extension (among resections otherwise meeting R0 criteria). 10 Furthermore, the outcomes are similar to that of patients undergoing R1,2 resection 10 ; this is corroborated by an unadjusted comparison in another study. 59 A meta-analysis found that extracapsular extension was associated with lower OS and higher recurrence rates, although most studies did not adjust for confounders and spanned four decades. 62\nThe reason for con /uniFB02 icting results is unclear. The incidence of extranodal extension varies dramatically between studies, also unexplained. Most studies have not adjusted for N2 subcategories. One study found incrementally worse survival when more nodes exhibit extranodal extension, but whether extranodal extension involved N1 or N2 nodes had little impact. 57\nAlthough the microscopic presence of extranodal extension seems straightforward, what this represents regarding the surgical procedure is unclear. One can envision (1) a node with extranodal extension within a node packet, surrounded by a margin of normal tissue, (2) microscopically visible extranodal tumor extension at a resection margin of the node/node packet, or (3) extranodal extension in nodes that have been removed in pieces (making margin assessment impossible). The\n/uniFB01 rst scenario is mostly a tumor burden issue, the second a margin issue (already addressed by R1 and R2 margin descriptors), and the third a technical issue and communication issue between the surgeon and pathologist. This third scenario is presumably most common. Because nodes are friable and lie within loose tissue, they are often removed in pieces -rendering it impossible to ascertain a margin. The pathologist ' s only recourse is the capsule of an intact node as a surrogate -the resection margin is presumably negative if tumor lies within a node with an intact capsule, but potentially positive if extracapsular extension is found. A problem remains when nodes are removed in pieces -the resection margin cannot be assessed (and identi /uniFB01 cation of extranodal extension is compromised). From a practical perspective, the pathology report provides some information about extranodal extension, whereas information on how nodes were removed or the nodal resection margin is rarely available.\nIn summary, more research is needed to clarify the impact of the extranodal extension descriptor. Perhaps more importantly, better de /uniFB01 nition of the issue of interest is needed so appropriate data are gathered.\nOne can argue that uncertainty about the impact and ambiguity about what it re /uniFB02 ects suggests that extranodal extension /uniFB01 ts as an R(un) descriptor. A general SPFC principle is to avoid changes unless there is strong evidence that change is needed. Because addressing the uncertainties will take time, it is best to retain extranodal extension as an R1 descriptor.\nR1 -Malignant Pleural or Pericardial Effusion.

This seems intuitively logical, but data directly comparing this with other R1 descriptors are limited. Survival was similar among patients with a malignant effusion who underwent resection (R1) and those with a positive margin (90% microscopic, 10% macroscopic residual, R1,2) in one study (adjusted for eight potential confounders, but involving a limited number of malignant effusion cases). 10 In addition, reasonable long-term outcomes are consistently reported in patients with pleural dissemination undergoing resection. The eighth and ninth edition analyses have not addressed this, but in the seventh edition analysis, such patients had a 5-year OS of 31% if N0 R0 (22 patients) and 24% if N0 R-any (87 patients). 63 Similar results are found in Figure 3 among patients undergoing resections meeting criteria for R0 other than the pleural dissemination. 39,44,46,47 Many studies corroborate this. 64 -73 A substantial proportion of these patients never experience a pleural recurrence (or recurrence at any site). Although not well de /uniFB01 ned, approximately two-thirds of patients undergoing resection of pleural M1a tumors involved pleural tumor nodules, and outcomes may be better after macroscopic complete resection of pleural nodules versus when a malignant effusion is present. 65 -67,70 Limited data have been reported regarding resection of tumors with pericardial dissemination. 70\nThus, consistent data suggest that outcomes are similar in patients with pleural dissemination undergoing macroscopic complete resection and those undergoing an R1 resection de /uniFB01 ned by other criteria (but comparisons across studies should be interpreted cautiously). Moreover, it is intuitively logical to consider a resection in the face of pleural dissemination as R1 -concern of microscopic residual exists despite no visible tumor remaining.",

      "title": "Proposed Ninth Edition R-Classi /uniFB01 cation",
      "content": "On review of the evidence and considerations discussed in the previous sections, some modi /uniFB01 cations to the R-classi /uniFB01 cation are proposed (Table 7). The table includes changes from the eighth edition intended to improve clarity and a summary assessment of the basis for the descriptors.\nThe uncertain descriptors of positive pleural lavage cytology result Odds ratio (or) CIS at a bronchial margin are more explicitly identi /uniFB01 ed as R1(un) descriptors. Highest node involvement is interpreted to mean that tumor is present in the highest (most cephalad) node station (lowest node station number) assessed, rather than an individual node.\nThe recommendation regarding a complete node assessment is clari /uniFB01 ed to apply to node stations rather than individual nodes ( /C21 6 stations, with at least station #7 and two additional mediastinal stations). It is important that the surgeon labels nodes (e.g., #10, #11), whether submitted separately or en-bloc with the specimen. Node stations invasively assessed preoperatively (e.g., endobronchial ultrasound, mediastinoscopy) and intraoperatively count collectively toward this descriptor. Actual dissection of a node station that documents absence of any nodes (e.g., #L2) counts as a station that was evaluated (if clearly documented in the operative report). The same applies regarding N1 node stations dissected by the pathologist (with documentation in the pathology report). For endobronchial ultrasound, documentation of no nodes or only nodes less than 5 mm within a node station counts as an assessment. If the tissue submitted from a node station reveals no nodal tissue, or there is insuf /uniFB01 cient tissue (e.g., aspiration cytology) to allow a de /uniFB01 nitive diagnosis, it counts as a negative assessment of that station (this assumes that clinicians will exercise judgment and consider a second assessment of the station if the negative/nondiagnostic result is suspected to be a false negative).\nIf a limited node assessment reveals no involved nodes, the tumor is classi /uniFB01 ed as N0 by IASLC, AJCC, and UICC; if no nodes at all are assessed, it is classi /uniFB01 ed as NX. 4 -6 The resection in both of these scenarios is\nclassi /uniFB01 ed as R0(un) (provided the resection meets other criteria for R0).\nThe seventh and eighth edition descriptions of the Rclassi /uniFB01 cation 3,6 mentioned a lobe-speci /uniFB01 c node dissection as de /uniFB01 ned by the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons 74 as an alternative to the 6-station de /uniFB01 nition of a complete node assessment. Nevertheless, the technical difference is limited -the lobe-speci /uniFB01 c assessment still requires 6 node stations; the difference is in which mediastinal stations are recommended based on the lobe involved. A recent detailed study found identical OS comparing resections de /uniFB01 ned as R0 by the IASLC 6node/station de /uniFB01 nition or by a lobe-speci /uniFB01 c de /uniFB01 nition (n ¼ 1119; 2009 -2019). 10 Another detailed study found involvement of N2 node stations not included in the lobe-speci /uniFB01 c de /uniFB01 nition in a substantial minority of resections, in both single N2 (N2a) and multistation (N2b) cohorts (n ¼ 1779; 1980 -2009). 75 Implementation of a general system is easier than a lobe-speci /uniFB01 c system. Therefore, the R-subcommittee recommends the more general 6-station de /uniFB01 nition of a complete node assessment, with the assumption that knowledgeable surgeons will include the stations most likely to be involved in an individual patient.\nExtranodal extension is de /uniFB01 ned as a /uniFB01 nding on pathologic evaluation of hilar and mediastinal nodes. This applies (provided there is no gross tumor remaining) regardless of how the nodes were resected (as intact individual nodes, in fragments, or as a node packet involving an entire node station). Extranodal extension is not contingent on identi /uniFB01 cation of a resection margin around the nodes (or whether there is extension to a resection margin). It does not apply to intraparenchymal\nnodes, which presumably are surrounded by a margin of the resected lung. The de /uniFB01 nition of extranodal extension includes tumor that is directly extending beyond the node capsule into perinodal tissue, including discontinuous tumor deposits in lymphatics or perinodal fatty tissue. By the general UICC/AJCC rules, isolated tumor cells (de /uniFB01 ned as isolated cells or clumps of cells < 0.2 mm in diameter, often identi /uniFB01 ed by special staining techniques) are not counted toward the TNM categories or stage group assignment. Such a /uniFB01 nding in hilar/ mediastinal tissues is not included in the R-classi /uniFB01 cation. Nevertheless, micrometastases (tumor deposits 0.2 -2 mm in largest dimension) in perinodal tissues count as extranodal extension.\nWhen a resection involves several R descriptors, the overall R designation is based on the highest R descriptor that applies. Direct communication between the surgeon and pathologist is encouraged to resolve questions whether or not a surface with exposed tumor represents a surgical margin.\nThe R-subcommittee recommends using the R-classi /uniFB01 cation only in the context of a surgical resection and not consider expansion to describe response to nonsurgical treatment modalities, as was previously suggested 8 ; this is congruent with current UICC policy. 76 The de /uniFB01 -nitions and descriptors are clearly focused on a surgical setting. Issues regarding the de /uniFB01 nition of response in other settings are not addressed (e.g., response after stereotactic body radiosurgery, pseudoprogression after immunotherapy). The meaning of a complete response after targeted therapy (with frequent emergence of resistance) is different than complete tumor resection.

Speci /uniFB01 cally, if resection of oligometastatic distant metastases is undertaken (e.g., adrenal, brain metastases), the R-classi /uniFB01 cation should apply to describe the completeness of the procedure. The R-subcommittee recommends following the UICC policy 76 of recording the site of resection -for example, R0 (thorax) or R0 (adrenal).\nWith the increasing use of de /uniFB01 nitive local therapy for oligometastatic disease, it is important to de /uniFB01 ne how the R-classi /uniFB01 cation applies when de /uniFB01 nitive local therapy is not delivered to all sites of disease simultaneously. The eighth edition AJCC and UICC books contain statements that are internally con /uniFB02 icting and ambiguous 5,76 ; IASLC has not addressed the issue in the past. 6 The R-subcommittee proposes that the R-classi/uniFB01 cation applies to a speci /uniFB01 c surgical procedure -and not count tumor in another site that is to be addressed at another time (perhaps with another treatment modality). It is important to clearly communicate the completeness of a resection, even if it is only one part of the treatment plan. It is also critical to acknowledge that another site of tumor remains to be addressed; this is essential for accurate recording in databases. Recording the site of resection -for example, R0 (thorax) and the M1 category -accomplishes this. This approach would be able to accommodate separate steps in the management strategy, a combination of treatment modalities, and communicate the completeness of a speci /uniFB01 c step.",

      "content": "In conjunction with proposed revisions for the ninth edition TNM classi /uniFB01 cation of lung cancer, the R-subcommittee has undertaken re /uniFB01 nement of the R-classi /uniFB01 cation. In general, the existing classi /uniFB01 cation is supported by available evidence, although in many areas, it is limited. Many clari /uniFB01 cations align with how studies have been applying the R-classi /uniFB01 cation. Therefore, we anticipate that the ninth edition R-classi /uniFB01 cation can be implemented easily. We hope that these revisions facilitate consistent recording of the R-status in health care records around the world.\nWe believe that this review provides as solid a basis for re /uniFB01 nement of the R-classi /uniFB01 cation as is currently possible despite limitations in the available data. Understanding whether an observed difference re /uniFB02 ects the resection completeness or simply an association with a confounding anatomic-, patient-, or setting-related factor is a particular challenge. This review addressed this by\nemphasizing studies that have adjusted for at least some confounders. As a crude measure, the tables list the number of factors used. Nevertheless, this does not shed light on unaddressed domains of confounding, how closely the factors used approximate the actual potential confounders, and statistical limitations when the number of events is low.\nThe R-classi /uniFB01 cation is not part of a prognostic model. Outcomes are assessed only to judge whether a potential R-descriptor is consequential enough to include. The Rstatus is a categorization of the physical presence of residual tumor after resection. Thus, the purpose of the R-classi /uniFB01 cation allows conclusions to be drawn despite ambiguities in the available data on outcomes. Furthermore, by providing clear de /uniFB01 nitions, the R-classi /uniFB01 cation establishes a universal way that terms are understood, data are collected, and results are reported. This facilitates ongoing research and the day-to-day ability to communicate and evaluate the applicability of clinical trials and guidelines to individual patients.\nThere are clearly areas of ambiguity that require more work. For example, although a thorough node evaluation is generally supported, this does not apply to all tumors. Several considerations need to be evaluated to /uniFB01 gure out how best to address this. The increased complexity would hamper implementation if the R-classi /uniFB01 cation only applied to some tumors or involved different de /uniFB01 nitions depending on tumor characteristics. Analysis of the impact of the extent of node assessment in the ninth edition IASLC database is planned. The Japan Clinical Oncology Group has completed accrual (n ¼ 1500) to a randomized trial of systematic versus selective node dissection for cI -II Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); results are anticipated in 2027. 77\nAlthough the recommendation for assessment of six node stations to fully de /uniFB01 ne the pathologic stage remains, this should not be interpreted as a quality metric. Designing (and implementing) quality metrics is not the purview of the SPFC and requires consideration of factors such as validity (consistency of linkage to improved outcomes), feasibility (ability to measure and translate into practice), and relevance (variability in existing practice and applicability of the indicator).\nThe extranodal extension descriptor also requires improvement. Current data are con /uniFB02 icting and likely in /uniFB02 uenced by unaccounted confounders. Particularly with the subdivision of the N2 category in the ninth edition (N2a and N2b), this needs to be studied more thoroughly to understand whether extranodal extension itself is important or simply a marker of tumor burden or technical challenges during node dissection.\nAspects of the parenchymal margin assessment need additional attention, particularly as sublobar resection is\ngaining importance and peripheral tumors have replaced central endobronchial tumors as the predominant tumor location. The SPFC has decided that ' spread through air spaces ' (STAS, a microscopic /uniFB01 nding adjacent to the primary tumor) should be an additional histologic descriptor and not a component of the T- or R-classi/uniFB01 cation. 78 Should /uniFB01 nding foci of AIS at a parenchymal margin be included in the R-classi /uniFB01 cation? Arguments against this include the fact that, when observed, most foci that likely are AIS histologically do not progress in 10 years. 79 -81\nTechniques that can detect evidence of tumor in the bloodstream (e.g., circulating tumor cells, cell-free DNA) are not addressed in this paper. A thoughtful exploration is needed to de /uniFB01 ne what role, if any, this should play in a classi /uniFB01 cation of the completeness of surgical resection. Considerations include assay availability, standardization, false negative rates, broad applicability versus only with speci /uniFB01 c molecular markers, and context (e.g., immediately postoperatively, long-term surveillance). The most important issue is probably whether it is appropriate to view tumor detection in the blood as a measure of a surgical procedure, anatomic tumor extent, a prognostic factor, or a useful marker to guide patient management.\nIn conclusion, the R-subcommittee has assembled available evidence to inform revisions to the R-classi /uniFB01 cation of lung cancer. Although the evidence generally has upheld the R categories -R0, R(un), R1, and R2 -the review has also pointed out opportunities to clarify the de /uniFB01 nition of some descriptors in these categories. We hope that the proposed re /uniFB01 nements of the R-classi /uniFB01 cation will facilitate communication about the type of resection accomplished as the ninth edition becomes implemented. We also hope that review of the available data and knowledge gaps will stimulate research by the global thoracic community and promote continued progress.",
