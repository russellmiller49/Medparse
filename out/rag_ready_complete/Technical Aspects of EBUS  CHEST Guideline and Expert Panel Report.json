In patients undergoing Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, we suggest that tissue sampling may be performed either with or without suction (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement).\n4. In patients undergoing Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, we recommend that the use of either a 21- or 22-gauge needle is an acceptable option (Grade 1C).\n5. In the absence of rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) in patients suspected of having lung cancer and undergoing Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for diagnosis, we suggest that a minimum of 3 separate needle passes be performed per sampling site (Ungraded ConsensusBased Statement).\n6. In patients undergoing Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for diagnostic evaluation, we recommend that tissue sampling can be performed with or without rapid on-site evaluation (Grade 1C).\n7. In patients undergoing Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for the diagnosis and/or staging of suspected or known non-small cell lung cancer, we recommend that additional samples, beyond those needed to establish the diagnosis, be obtained for molecular analysis (Grade 1C).\n8. In training Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA operators, we suggest that low- or high/uniFB01 delity simulation be incorporated in training (Grade 2C).\n9. In evaluating Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA operators, we suggest that validated Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) skills assessment tests be used to objectively assess skill level (Ungraded ConsensusBased Statement).\n10. In patients with suspected sarcoidosis with mediastinal and/or hilar adenopathy, we recommend that Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA be used for diagnosis (Grade 1C).\n11. In patients with suspected tuberculosis with mediastinal and/or hilar adenopathy who require lymph node sampling, we recommend that Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA be used for diagnosis (Grade 1C).\n12. In patients with suspected lymphoma, we suggest that Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA is an acceptable initial, minimally invasive diagnostic test (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement).\nEndobronchial ultrasound (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)) is a technology that allows real-time visualization of structures adjacent to the airways during bronchoscopy. Linear Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) incorporates an ultrasound transducer into the tip of a standard bronchoscope and guides transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) of lymph nodes and parabronchial masses. Radial Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) integrates a miniature ultrasound transducer into a freestanding probe that can be advanced through the bronchoscope ' s working channel into the periphery of the lung to guide sampling of peripheral lung nodules and masses. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) was introduced into bronchoscopy almost a decade ago and has transformed the diagnostic approach to mediastinal and hilar diseases, particularly in lung cancer.\nThe American College of Chest Physicians ' (CHEST) lung cancer guidelines (third edition) summarized the data on Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNAinthe mediastinal staging of lung cancer and reported an overall median sensitivity of 89% and a median negative predictive of 91%. 1 Based on these /uniFB01 ndings, the\nAFFILIATIONS: From the Duke University Medical Center (Dr Wahidi), Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Durham, NC; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (Dr Herth), University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany; Division of Thoracic Surgery (Dr Yasufuku), Toronto General Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada; Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center (Dr Shepherd), Richmond, VA; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (Drs Yarmus and Feller-Kopman), Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD;Division of Medicine (Dr Chawla), Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (Dr Lamb), Lahey Clinic Hospital, Burlington, MA; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr Casey), University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI; CHEST (Ms Patel), Glenview, IL; and Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine (Dr Silvestri), Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC.\nDISCLAIMER: American College of Chest Physician guidelines are intended for general information only, are not medical advice, and do not replace professional medical care and physician advice, which always should be sought for any medical condition.

The overall objective of the present CHEST guideline and expert panel report was to examine the current knowledge of the technical aspects of linear Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, including patient factors (sedation), procedural aspects (ultrasonographic features\nof lymph nodes, needle size, number of needle passes, use of suction, and presence of rapid on-site cytologic evaluation), and proceduralists ' aptitude (training). We speci /uniFB01 cally did not address the diagnostic yield of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA in the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer because this topic was addressed in the third edition of the CHEST lung cancer guidelines. 1 We did believe, however, that the diagnostic yield of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA in other mediastinal diseases, such as TB, sarcoidosis, and lymphoma, has not been not well studied and opted to include these questions in our report.",

      "title": "Sedation",
      "content": "Sedation is de /uniFB01 ned as a continuum of altered consciousness levels, including minimal sedation (anxiolysis), moderate sedation (conscious sedation), deep sedation, and general anesthesia. Moderate sedation is de /uniFB01 ned as a drug-induced depression in consciousness wherein patients can respond purposefully to verbal commands while maintaining a functional airway, spontaneous ventilation, and cardiovascular function. Deep sedation causes a deeper state of depressed consciousness in which patients cannot be easily aroused but respond purposefully to repeated or painful stimulation and may have compromised airway function and spontaneous ventilation; cardiovascular function is usually maintained. 9\nThe ideal type of sedation in Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) procedures is an important question for bronchoscopists as they seek the best conditions to optimize their diagnostic yield, enhance patients ' comfort, and avoid complications. Sedation also represents a signi /uniFB01 cant contributory element in the economics of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA as it relates to cost of care, work /uniFB02 ow, and health-care resources utilization in terms of anesthesia services and medications.\nThree studies met the inclusion criteria and compared moderate and deep sedation during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscopy. The primary outcomes of these studies included diagnostic yield, procedural complications, and patient satisfaction. The two studies that reported on diagnostic yield between patients undergoing deep or moderate sedation had con /uniFB02 icting results. The retrospective study by Yarmus et al 10 assessed 309 patients from two separate institutions and multiple proceduralists performing EBUSwith moderate or deep sedation. The authors found a statistically signi /uniFB01 cant bene /uniFB01 t of deep sedation use on diagnostic yield in a multivariable analysis. The trial by Casal et al, 11 a prospective randomized controlled study of 149 patients, found no difference in the diagnostic yield in a single-center/single-operator setup. However, fewer patients in the moderate sedation group were able to complete the procedure compared with the deep sedation group ( P ¼ .028). The studies by Dal et al 12 and Casal et al 11 also assessed patient comfort and satisfaction, and no differences were found overall between sedation groups. There were no major complications or escalation of care in either sedation group reported in any of the studies included in this analysis.\nThe level of evidence, size, and quality of the existing studies affected our grading and conclusion regarding\nthe choice of sedation used for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscopy. The study by Yarmus et al 10 was limited by its retrospective design and comparison of two different institutions with inherent, and potentially confounding, differences in practice and patients. Although the study by Casal et al 11 was prospective and randomized, their results must be viewed with caution because the sample size was small and the procedures were performed at one institution and by a single experienced physician. The study by Dal et al 12 did investigate patient comfort, but the outcomes with regard to diagnostic yield were not addressed in the study. No study addressed the difference in cost of care between the two choices of sedation.\n1. In patients undergoing Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, we suggest that either moderate or deep sedation is an acceptable approach (Grade 2C).",

      "content": "When performing Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscopy procedures, the bronchoscopist has the option of inserting the scope through natural ori /uniFB01 ces (nose or mouth), a laryngeal mask airway, or an endotracheal tube.\nThe literature search found insuf /uniFB01 cient evidence to recommend for or against an arti /uniFB01 cial airway for insertion of the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscope in terms of diagnostic yield of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA. Because of the lack of data regarding PICO Question 2 (Table 1), we are unable to make a formal recommendation regarding placement of an arti /uniFB01 cial airway during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA bronchoscopy. The suggestion regarding sedation in Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA bronchoscopy and the discussion of PICO Question 9 regarding route of scope insertion in Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA bronchoscopy offers further details.\nClearly, the level of sedation plays a critical role in determining the need for an arti /uniFB01 cial airway; however, PICO Question 2 speci /uniFB01 cally assessed the impact on diagnostic yield if an arti /uniFB01 cial airway is used during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA bronchoscopy. One prospective study 13 looked at the use of a modi /uniFB01 ed laryngeal mask airway during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA but did not assess diagnostic yield as an outcome. This study compared 70 patients who underwent Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA with intravenous anesthesia, muscle relaxation, and modi /uniFB01 ed laryngeal mask airway (n ¼ 46) or topical aerosolized 2% lidocaine only (n ¼ 24). The laryngeal mask airway group was found to have higher oxygen saturation during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) probe insertion and signi /uniFB01 cantly lower heart rate, systolic\nblood pressure, and diastolic blood pressure during the procedure. In addition, reduced body movement, absence of choking or suffocation episodes, and no procedural termination were noted in the laryngeal mask airway group.\nOne institution 14 reported their anesthesia practice for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA as safe, using general anesthesia, muscle paralysis as needed, and a laryngeal mask airway. An endotracheal tube was used in the setting of dif /uniFB01 cult laryngeal mask airway placement, obesity, or severe untreated gastroesophageal re /uniFB02 ux disease. No speci /uniFB01 c data on diagnostic yield were reported. Earlier studies of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA 15-17 reported on the use of either combined rigid and /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopy with general anesthesia, /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopy alone with moderate sedation with no speci /uniFB01 ed route, or local anesthesia with an oral route.\nCHEST Quality Improvement Registry, Evaluation and Education (AQuIRE) bronchoscopy module captured comprehensive data on TBNA. 18 Over a 12-month period, 891 patients were enrolled to undergo TBNA procedures at six institutions, including 853 Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA procedures (95.7%) and 38 conventional TBNA procedures (4.3%). Laryngeal mask airway was used in 433 procedures (48.6%), endotracheal tube in 59 (6.6%), and tracheostomy tube in 4 (0.4%); the remainder were conducted via the nasal route in 109 (12.2%) or the oral route in 295 (33.1%) with no arti /uniFB01 cial airway. Data for diagnostic yield by use of an arti /uniFB01 cial airway were not reported.\nIt is important to recognize that the placement of the endotracheal tube may block the ultrasonographic view of the higher paratracheal lymph nodes (lymph node stations 1, 2R, 2L, and 3P) and should be avoided if one of these lymph nodes is the sampling target of the procedure.\nIf using a transoral arti /uniFB01 cial airway, a bite block should be considered to protect the bronchoscope from bite damage. This approach is recommended independent of the depth of sedation. A minimum size of 8.0 should be used if placing an endotracheal tube for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA to accommodate the scope diameter and leave room for gas exchange.\nIn conclusion, there is insuf /uniFB01 cient quality of evidence to recommend for or against arti /uniFB01 cial airways for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA. Reported practice is scattered and is largely based on expert opinion, operator comfort, sedation type, and institutional standards.",

      "title": "Ultrasonographic Features",
      "content": "Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) can distinguish lymph nodes and lung masses from vessels, and it can also display ultrasonographic features of the examined structures such as size, shape, border, heterogeneity, central hilar structure, and necrosis. Just as with CT and MRI scanning, bronchoscopists are interested in identifying imaging features that would predict certain diseases to help them guide the sampling process.\nNine studies met the inclusion criteria and provided analysis of the characteristics of lymph nodes that predict malignancy during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS). 19-27 Outcomes from the studies could not be combined because of the heterogeneity of the data and the fact that the ultrasonographic features assessed were not the same in each study or they had varying de /uniFB01 nitions of what constituted ' abnormal. '\nFujiwara et al 20 published the largest series to date assessing endoscopic lymph node features that could help distinguish benign from malignant disease by evaluating > 1,000 lymph nodes in nearly 500 patients. In addition, they provided a standard classi /uniFB01 cation system to de /uniFB01 ne ultrasound features that were then variably assessed by others. The prede /uniFB01 ned features they assessed were: (1) size (short-axis < 1 cm, > 1 cm), (2) shape (oval, round), (3) margin (indistinct or distinct), (4) echogenicity (homogeneous or heterogeneous), (5) presence or absence of central hilar structure, and (6) presence or absence of a central necrosis sign. In multivariate analysis, they found that a round shape, distinct margins, heterogeneous echogenicity, and a central necrosis sign were independently predictive of malignancy. Furthermore, when all four factors were absent, 96% of the lymph nodes were benign.\nThree additional studies also assessed size criteria as a predictor; however, the results are con /uniFB02 icting. Although Fujiwara et al 20 found that size was not a reliable indicator, others have found that larger lymph nodes are more likely to harbor metastases. 21,24,26 These inconsistencies are possibly due to differences in how size was de /uniFB01 ned. Fujiwara et al 20 and Satterwhite et al 26 used a dichotomous variable ( < 1 cm or > 1 cm in the short-axis) and had similar /uniFB01 ndings, whereas Garcia-Olivé et al 21 used a 2-cm cutoff and Memoli et al 24 used 5-mm increases in size > 1 cm. In the latter two studies, a statistically signi /uniFB01 cant increase in presence of malignancy in a lymph node occurred as the size increased. These studies also con /uniFB01 rmed that roundshaped lymph nodes were more likely malignant than\n]\ntriangular or draping lymph nodes. Memoli et al 24 could not con /uniFB01 rm that a distinct border conferred a higher risk for malignancy, a /uniFB01 nding previously noted by Fujiwara et al. 20 They also assessed PET avidity and, after adjusting for lymph node size, hypermetabolic lymph nodes on PET scans did not confer an increased risk of malignancy.\nNakajima et al 25 assessed vascular image patterns within lymph nodes as a way to predict malignancy. They developed a classi /uniFB01 cation system by using grades (0-3) prede /uniFB01 ned as increasing vascular involvement from no blood /uniFB02 ow (grade 0) and single central vessel (grade I) and considered those benign. As vessel involvement increased in the node to rich /uniFB02 ow with > 4 vessels (grades 2 and 3), the nodes were considered malignant. The sensitivity and speci /uniFB01 city for malignancy in patients with grade 2 or 3 blood /uniFB02 ow in a lymph node were 87.7% and 69.6%, respectively, suggesting that increased vascularity assessed by using power/color Doppler mode ultrasound is useful in predicting malignancy. Satterwhite et al 26 con /uniFB01 rmed the benign /uniFB01 ndings in those patients with a central intranodal vessel (Nakajima class 1).\nTwo studies have assessed ultrasound features of lymph nodes in patients with sarcoidosis. Imai et al 22 compared ultrasound features of patients with sarcoidosis and lung cancer. Lymph nodes with homogeneous echogenicity and a germinal center were more likely to indicate sarcoidosis than lung cancer. Dhooria et al 19 attempted to use ultrasound features within lymph nodes to distinguish sarcoidosis from TB. They found that coagulation necrosis and heterogeneous echogenicity within lymph nodes were more likely to be present in TB as opposed to sarcoidosis.\nIn conclusion, the ultrasonographic predictors of malignancy in lymph nodes are not reliable enough to forgo biopsy to obtain a de /uniFB01 nitive tissue diagnosis. However, it is reasonable for experienced practitioners to use ultrasound features to guide sampling such that they obtain the highest yield from lymph nodes likely to be malignant. Future research should attempt to replicate the /uniFB01 ndings from these studies in a prospective manner by using standardized criteria in consecutive patients with both benign and malignant disease. In addition, technologies that take advantage of automated measurements within the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) processor, as well as other novel approaches to aid in distinguishing benignity from malignancy, should be tested on a larger scale. 23,27\n2. In patients undergoing Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, we suggest that ultrasonographic features can be used to predict malignant and benign diagnoses, but tissue samples should still be obtained to con /uniFB01 rm a diagnosis (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement).",

      "title": "Suction",
      "content": "The application of suction to needles during tissue aspiration has been a standard practice for many decades in numerous medical specialties, including in the use of conventional TBNA. Some theorize that suction may increase tissue trauma in the biopsy site and result in more bleeding and lower yields. Others argue that suction is bene /uniFB01 cial and produces a higher number of aspirated cells. Although this question has been studied in other anatomical sites, limited evaluation of the use of suction has been performed in Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA.\nOnly one study was found to address this question. Casal et al 28 performed a randomized prospective trial comparing Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA with suction vs Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA without the use of suction, referred to as transbronchial needle capillary sampling (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNCS). Subjects were randomized either to undergo TBNCS in passes 1 and 3 or TBNA with suction in passes 2 and 4 or the opposite order. Separate needles were used for passes 1 and 3 vs those used with passes 2 and 4. Only the initial four passes were included in the analysis. The primary end point was the concordance between suction TBNA and TBNCS for diagnostic yield and the adequacy of samples. There were no signi /uniFB01 cant differences between the two groups in specimen adequacy, diagnosis rate, or specimen quality regardless of node size. Concordance rates between the techniques were high, ranging from 83.3% to 95.8% for adequacy, diagnostic yield, and specimen quality.\nOther issues relating to the use of suction during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA that remain unknown include whether differing amounts of negative suction have an effect on acquisition of material or whether the effect of suction interacts with the various sizes of the needle. These questions require further study.\nIn cases in which Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA is being performed with suction and the samples obtained are bloody, operators should consider switching to the use of no suction at the same sampling site. If intranodal blood vessels are visualized on Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) imaging with or without Doppler imaging, operators should also consider obtaining samples without suction.\n3. In patients undergoing Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, we suggest that tissue sampling may be performed either with or without suction (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement).",

      "title": "Needle Size",
      "content": "Several needles are available to obtain specimens via Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, including those of variable sizes (25-, 22-, or 21-gauge) and materials (stainless steel or nitinol). The size of the needle may affect the quantity of tissue obtained, degree of tissue trauma, and amount of aspirated blood -each of which can affect the quality of the specimen and the diagnostic yield.\nFive trials comparing needle sizes met our criteria for review, including three retrospective studies, 29-31 one prospective study, 32 and one randomized trial. 33 Of note, these trials compared only 21- and 22-gauge needles; no data are available on 25-gauge needles.\nNakajima et al 29 reviewed 45 Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA specimens in 33 patients in whom both 21- and 22-gauge needles were used. There was no statistically signi /uniFB01 cant difference in diagnostic yield, although two patients with adenocarcinoma were only diagnosed with the 21-gauge needle. The authors also found that the 21-gauge needle provided better ' histologic structure ' with an increased number of tumor cells present, but it was also associated with more blood contamination. The 22-gauge needle, however, tended to have improved preservation of nonnecrotizing granuloma compared with the 21-gauge needle ( P ¼ .695).\nYarmus et al 30 used the CHEST AQuIRE to review 1,235 procedures and found no signi /uniFB01 cant difference in sample adequacy or diagnostic yield. The use of the 21-gauge needle, when combined with the presence of rapid cytologic on-site evaluation, was associated with fewer needle passes per lymph node (3.5 vs 4.2; P < .01), potentially suggesting improved quality of specimen.\nJeyabalan et al 31 reviewed 303 patients referred for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA over 2 1 / 2 years. Needle size was selected at the discretion of the operator, and samples were assessed by histopathologists blinded to the needle used. No signi /uniFB01 cant difference in diagnostic yield for malignancy was seen. The major limitation of this study was the retrospective, single-center study design. It is also noteworthy that specimen analysis was performed by experienced histopathologists; thus, these data may not be extrapolated to centers using cytopathologic interpretation.\nSaji et al 32 prospectively evaluated 56 consecutive patients undergoing Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for the evaluation of mediastinal lesions. Use of the 21-gauge needle produced a higher cytologic sensitivity and overall diagnostic yield (cytologic þ histologic sensitivity), but there was no difference in histologic sensitivity. This study differs from the others in that it assessed results on a per-patient basis as opposed to a per-lymph node basis.\nThe only randomized trial comparing 21- vs 22-gauge needles was performed by Oki et al 33 in 60 patients with hilar/mediastinal adenopathy or tumor adjacent to a central airway. Patients were randomly assigned to have the /uniFB01 rst two needle passes with either the 21- or 22-gauge needle, and specimens were assessed for adequacy and diagnostic yield. There were no differences between groups in terms of target size, lymph node station, or prevalence of disease. Likewise, there was no difference between needle gauges in either outcome measure, although there was a trend of more inadequate samples with the 21-gauge needles.\nAt this time, needle choice should be determined by the operator. Some factors in /uniFB02 uencing needle size choice may include location and vascularity of the node. Future studies should investigate if a smaller or more /uniFB02 exible needle would improve sampling at station 4L (known for its slightly angulated location) or if smaller needles would result in less blood contamination when sampling more vascular nodes. Studies should also examine if a particular needle size should be used depending on how the specimens are being processed (histopathology vs cytopathology) and if needle size can affect the diagnosis of diseases that are more dif /uniFB01 cult to diagnose by Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, such as lymphoma.\n4. In patients undergoing Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, we recommend that the use of either a 21- or 22-gauge needle is an acceptable option (Grade 1C).",

      "title": "Number of Needle Passes",
      "content": "The number of needle passes per sampling site has implications on procedural ef /uniFB01 ciency (time spent on sampling by the proceduralist and interpretation of tissue samples by the pathologist, particularly when sampling multiple sites) balanced by the desire to achieve maximum diagnostic yield. For this discussion, a ' pass ' is a distinct entry and exit of the needle through the airway wall, and each pass typically includes /uniFB01 ve to 15 agitations of the needle within the target site.\nLee et al 34 conducted the only study that addressed this issue. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was performed on 163 stations in\n]\n102 patients with potentially operable non-small cell lung cancer and mediastinal adenopathy. Every target node was punctured four times. Sample adequacy was 90.1% after the /uniFB01 rst pass, 98.1% after two passes, and reached 100% after three passes. The sensitivity for differentiating malignant from benign lymph node stations was 69.8%, 83.7%, 95.3%, and 95.3% for one, two, three, and four passes, respectively.\nBased on this study, it seems that optimal diagnostic values with Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA can be obtained after a minimum of three passes with the caveat that this suggestion pertains to lung cancer diagnosis and staging. No data exist regarding the number of needle passes required to obtain a suf /uniFB01 cient diagnostic yield for lymphoma or other nonmalignant diseases of the mediastinum. The sampling of tissue for molecular marker testing is discussed in Statement 7.\n5. In the absence of rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) in patients suspected of having lung cancer and undergoing Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for diagnosis, we suggest that a minimum of 3 separate needle passes be performed per sampling site (Ungraded ConsensusBased Statement).",

      "title": "Rapid On-Site Evaluation",
      "content": "Since the development of TBNA through a /uniFB02 exible bronchoscope in the late 1960s, rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) has been used with conventional TBNA to improve the diagnostic yield, decrease the number of needle passes, and reduce the need for additional diagnostic procedures. 35 With the advent of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), it was unclear if the same bene /uniFB01 ts would be realized by using ROSE because Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) provides real-time con /uniFB01 rmation that the needle is in the target and may obviate the need for a concurrent pathologic con /uniFB01 rmation of tissue adequacy.\nWe identi /uniFB01 ed three trials that ful /uniFB01 lled the inclusion criteria and addressed this issue. 36-38 Oki et al 36 conducted the only prospective randomized clinical trial on this question. They randomized 120 patients with mediastinal adenopathy and high suspicion of lung cancer to undergo Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA with or without ROSE. The collected material was blown by air with a syringe onto a glass slide. In patients assigned to the ROSE group, one glass slide was used for ROSE and another was submitted for Papanicolaou-stained cytologic examination. For ROSE, a cytotechnologist evaluated the cell material of the air-dried smears on-site (Diff-Quik staining method). The decision regarding\ntermination or additional sampling was made by the examiner on the basis of the ROSE results. Mean puncture number was signi /uniFB01 cantly lower in the ROSE group (2.2 vs 3.1 punctures; P < .001), but mean bronchoscopy time was similar between groups (22.3 vs 22.1 min; P ¼ .95). The sensitivity and accuracy for diagnosing lung cancer were 88% and 89%, respectively, in the ROSE group, and 86% and 89% in the non-ROSE group. Additional procedures including Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for lesions other than the main target lesion and/or transbronchial biopsy in the same setting were performed in 11% of patients in the ROSE group and 57% in the non-ROSE group ( P < .001). This study showed that ROSE can decrease the number of punctures and reduce the need for additional staging and diagnostic procedures.\nTwo other trials retrospectively reviewed the value of ROSE. Grif /uniFB01 n et al 37 conducted a retrospective analysis of 294 Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA specimens; 48% had been performed with ROSE. There was no signi /uniFB01 cant difference in diagnostic yield, number of sites sampled per patient, or clinical decision-making between specimens collected with or without ROSE.\nMurakami et al 38 analyzed the records of 780 patients by using Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA. The results of 100 Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA procedures, with or without ROSE, in 98 patients with a de /uniFB01 nitive diagnosis of a small cell lung cancer were reported. ROSE did not have any impact on the diagnostic yield (99% with ROSE vs 90% without ROSE; P < .1), but it reduced the number of aspirates per procedure (mean 2.3 with ROSE vs 4.0 without ROSE; P < .01).\nIn conclusion, the current data suggest that ROSE does not affect the diagnostic yield in Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA procedures, but it may reduce the number of needed aspirations as well as the number of other procedures (ie, TBLB) required. It is noteworthy that ROSE may be bene /uniFB01 cial in judging the quantity of available malignant cells when testing for molecular markers is planned in patients with advanced adenocarcinoma of the lung.\n6. In patients undergoing Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for diagnostic evaluation, we recommend that tissue sampling can be performed with or without rapid on-site evaluation (Grade 1C).",

      "content": "Molecular marker testing in advanced adenocarcinoma or undifferentiated non-small cell lung cancer of the\nlung is now considered standard of care and necessary for tailoring the best chemotherapy to the cancer characteristics of each individual patient. Because Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA is increasingly used to diagnose lung cancer, it is imperative to understand whether this modality provides adequate tissue for molecular markers and the optimal number of aspirations to do so.\nFourteen studies met the inclusion criteria and addressed the utility of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA sample acquisition for molecular analysis testing. The primary outcome was the success of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA to acquire samples that were suf /uniFB01 cient to be tested for molecular markers. A total of 684 cases were included. The studies by Lee et al, 39 Bugalho et al, 40 and Schmid-Bindert et al 41 were prospective trials assessing the feasibility of molecular marker testing in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. They found that mutational testing was feasible and reproducible. The remainder of these studies were retrospective 42-52 ; however, all displayed a very high adequacy rate for obtaining tissue that was suf /uniFB01 cient to test for mutational markers, leading to the strength of our recommendation.\nOnly one retrospective study addressed the number of passes required to have adequate tissue for molecular testing. In 85 patients with adenocarcinoma or non-small cell lung cancer, Yarmus et al 52 found that 93.5% of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA specimens were adequate for molecular pro /uniFB01 ling. A median of four Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA passes, in conjunction with ROSE, were needed to establish this adequacy rate. The current data are insuf /uniFB01 cient to identify the number of passes needed to obtain adequate tissue for molecular marker testing, but it is strongly suggested that additional samples, over the proposed diagnostic threshold of three passes (as discussed in the earlier section on Needle Passes), are recommended.\n7.

The choice of access depends on several variables such as type of sedation, anatomy, scope size, and institutional or practitioner preferences.\nTraditionally, the transnasal approach has been popular for conventional /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopy due to improved patient comfort, reduced gag, decreased lidocaine dosing, and enhanced bronchoscope stability. Limitations can be due to nasal anatomy, scope size, thrombocytopenia, or coagulopathy. 53-55 In a prospective cohort survey study of conventional bronchoscopy, 74% of patients who underwent nasal bronchoscopy (385 of 461 [83.5%]) compared with 57.1% (70 of 461 [15.2%]) via the oral route stated they would ' de /uniFB01 nitely return ' for repeat /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopy if indicated. 56 However, preferences for the oral route prevailed based on patient comfort and less insertion site bleeding in one prospective study, 57 and the transoral route was noted as the predominant insertion site in a Japanese national survey of bronchoscopists. 58\nPICO Question 9 looked at the transnasal vs transoral approach when performing Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA independent of an arti /uniFB01 cial airway. The importance of this issue compared with traditional /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopy rests on the larger diameter, more rigid distal end, and the recessed forward oblique bronchoscopic view of an Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) scope. The latter is of varying degrees depending on the manufacturer. Although diagnostic yield is the main primary end point in assessing procedural technology, feasibility, safety, and patient comfort are equally important end points. Beaudoin et al 59 analyzed 196 consecutive patients at their institution who underwent Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA by six different attending physicians, with or without trainees. This retrospective review was an indirect comparison of nasal vs oral approaches, and it reported a diagnostic yield of 22 of 52 (42.3%) in the oral route group vs 74 of 155 (51.4%) in the nasal route group ( P ¼ .26). This is the only published study looking at diagnostic yield based on insertion site of a dedicated linear Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscope. An early study 17 of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA reported only use of the oral route with local anesthesia and an accuracy of 97.1%.\nThe CHEST AQuIRE captured comprehensive data on TBNA. 17 During a 12-month period at six US institutions, 891 TBNA procedures were performed. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was used in 853 procedures (95.7%), and the remaining 38 (4.3%) used conventional TBNA. Nasal bronchoscope insertion was completed in 109 (12.2%) procedures. Data for scope insertion route speci /uniFB01 cally by scope type, by mode of TBNA, and diagnostic yield by bronchoscopy route were not reported.\n]\nIn conclusion, there is insuf /uniFB01 cient quality of evidence to support any route of bronchoscope insertion for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA over another.

It is worth remembering that the balloons come at an additional, albeit small, cost and are made of latex and thus cannot be used in patients with latex allergies.\nNo studies were found addressing this issue, and therefore no recommendations or suggestions can be made. From a practical perspective, balloons are commonly used when the target lymph nodes are located in the paratracheal areas (2R, 2L, 4R, and 4L), particularly for the slightly challenging angle of the left paratracheal lymph node (4L), and hilar stations (10R and 10L).

      "content": "Measurement of competency and procedural skill in bronchoscopy and numerous other medical procedures has been the subject of increased focus and research in the last several years. The limitations of procedural competency measurements based solely on number of procedures performed are well recognized; researchers have thus sought other methods to measure bronchoscopy skills, including simulation skill assessments and other performance-based metrics. A study in general bronchoscopy by Wahidi et al 64 showed that performance-based competency metrics could be used as a tool to assess bronchoscopy skills. Skill levels were assessed by using the Bronchoscopy Skills and Tasks Assessment Tool in cohorts of new pulmonary fellows performing basic bronchoscopy.\nFor Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscopy, a study by Davoudi et al 65 evaluated the validity and reliability of a similar tool, the Endobronchial Ultrasound Skills and Tasks Assessment Tool (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-STAT). The Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-STAT scores bronchoscope introduction, navigation, image acquisition, vascular imaging, nodal imaging, sampling of one station, and image modi /uniFB01 cation. It also includes a 25-slide test of CT and Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) imaging knowledge. The tool was administered to eight operators each in a beginner ( < 20 Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) procedures performed), intermediate (20-50 Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) procedures), and experienced ( > 50 Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) procedures) category of bronchoscopists. The Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-STAT was able to statistically signi /uniFB01 cantly distinguish the categories of beginner, intermediate, and experienced broncoscopy operators. The mean Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-STAT scores for the beginner, intermediate, and experienced groups were 31.1, 74.9, and 93.6,\nrespectively, from a 100-point scale ( P < .001). The two testers had detailed knowledge and experience with the assessment tool, resulting in a very high inter-rater reliability ( r ¼ 0.9991, P < .00005), which may not be true for testers who are not as familiar with the tool. It was also noted that the signi /uniFB01 cant difference in scores among the three groups was in the technical portion of the scores and not the test portion, suggesting that the skills portion may be the more important part of the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-STAT tool.\nAnother small prospective study used virtual reality simulation to assess Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) performance. Konge et al 66 examined simulator metrics with discriminatory ability in experienced Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) operators (n ¼ 6), untrained novices (n ¼ 8), and simulator-trained novices (n ¼ 8). Each operator performed two simulated Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA procedures on the GI-BRONCH Mentor (Simbionix Products). Of eight metrics examined, the simulator metrics that demonstrated statistically signi /uniFB01 cant differences among experienced and novice Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) operators were the number of successfully sampled lymph nodes ( P ¼ .047) and procedure time ( P ¼ .002). These two metrics were combined into a quality score that demonstrated a median quality score for the experienced group of 0.24 and 0.098 for the novice group ( P ¼ .001). This study showed that not all Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA metrics have discriminatory ability but that virtual reality Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) simulators may have a role in assessing operator ability prior to performing the procedure in patients.\nA third study examined four cohorts of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) users to validate a different Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) simulator, the AccuTouch Flexible Bronchoscopy Simulator (CAE Healthcare). 67 Twenty-two bronchoscopists were divided into the following groups: novice bronchoscopists, experts without Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) experience, basic clinical Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) training (pulmonary trainees or recent graduates), and Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) experts. Signi /uniFB01 cant differences among groups were found by the simulator for the metrics of total procedure time, percentage of successful biopsies, and percentage of lymph nodes correctly identi /uniFB01 ed ( P ¼ .05). The /uniFB01 ndings suggest that this simulator can accurately discriminate among various skill levels of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) operators.\nThese three studies are heterogeneous and thus preclude the pooling of data. 65-68 Although the overall sample size of these three studies is small, they support the use of a validated Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) skills assessment tool in performing Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA in human subjects as well as the use of simulators to distinguish between the skill levels of\nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) operators. It is important to recognize that none of the included simulation studies examined whether the skills demonstrated on a simulation assessment are transferred to an improvement in clinical skills as performed in patients. These types of tools may prove useful in determining physicians ' hospital procedural privileges or in other types of training programs.\nAlthough not included in the /uniFB01 nal analysis, several other studies examined related aspects of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) performance metrics. Three studies used cumulative sum analysis techniques to evaluate the learning curve of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) operators and reported how many procedures are needed to attain competency. 68-70 These studies included a very small number of operators and demonstrated signi /uniFB01 cant variability in learning Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA. Wahidi et al 71 examined the learning curve of general pulmonary fellows with Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA and found an average of 13 procedures were required to perform the /uniFB01 rst successful independent procedure. Another study assessed the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) learning curve among nine interventional pulmonary fellows; it found very variable learning rates and noted improvement in some performance metrics even after 200 clinical cases. 72 These additional studies did not speci /uniFB01 cally examine the strength, discriminatory ability, or reliability of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) performance metrics tools as was done in the three primary studies included in the analysis.\n9. In evaluating Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA operators, we suggest that validated Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) skills assessment tests be used to objectively assess skill level (Ungraded ConsensusBased Statement).",

      "title": "Diagnosis of Sarcoidosis",
      "content": "The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is based on the presence of a compatible clinical scenario, radiographic /uniFB01 ndings, and histologic con /uniFB01 rmation of noncaseating granulomatous in /uniFB02 ammation. Transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB), endobronchial biopsy (EBB), and TBNA are commonly used bronchoscopic techniques for determining granulomas. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was initially introduced as a minimally invasive modality for lymph node staging in lung cancer. However, the use of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA has been expanded for the evaluation of patients with mediastinal and hilar adenopathy. Studies have illustrated the bene /uniFB01 t of using Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA alone as well as in conjunction with other bronchoscopic techniques for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Earlier studies of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA on sarcoidosis have mainly been retrospective case review analyses; however, several prospective studies as well as randomized controlled trials are available on this topic.\n]\nAgarwal et al 73 performed a systematic review and metaanalysis of the ef /uniFB01 cacy and safety of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. The study included 15 studies with a total of 553 patients with sarcoidosis. The diagnostic yield of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA ranged from 54% to 93%, with the pooled diagnostic accuracy of 79% (95% CI, 71-86). Of interest, there was no statistical difference in the yield in studies using ROSE (80.1%) vs those without ROSE (81.3%). Ten additional studies (including 573 combined patients) 74-83 were identi /uniFB01 ed through updated searches of the systematic review by Agarwal et al. 73 These studies combined with those previously included led to a pooled diagnostic accuracy of 78.2% (95% CI, 75.6-80.4).\nGiven the high cost and poor availability of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) in developing countries, a head-to-head comparison of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA and conventional TBNA in combination with TBLB and EBB was performed in India by Gupta et al. 78 This randomized controlled trial enrolled 130 patients and randomized them (1:1) to undergo Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA þ TBLB and EBB vs conventional TBNA þ TBLB and EBB. Although there was no difference in the two arms (92.7% for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA vs 85.5% for conventional TBNA), Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA had the highest yield of 74.5%, which was better than that of TBNA (48.4%, P ¼ .004) and EBB (36.3%, P < .0001) but not TBLB (69.9%, P ¼ .54). Addition of TBLB signi /uniFB01 cantly enhanced the yield of EBUSTBNA. However, these results must be viewed with caution because only enlarged right paratracheal and subcarinal lymph nodes typically accessible by conventional TBNA were sampled, and the authors were probably more experienced in conventional TBNA.\nCompared with conventional bronchoscopic techniques for obtaining tissue, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA provides safe and minimally invasive access to the mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes with a pooled diagnostic accuracy of 79.1%. It is therefore recommended that Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA be used for diagnosis in patients with suspected sarcoidosis with mediastinal and/or hilar adenopathy. However, /uniFB01 brotic lymph nodes may be a challenge to obtain adequate tissue for diagnosis. Conventional bronchoscopic techniques such as TBLB and EBB will enhance the yield of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA in selected patients.\n10. In patients with suspected sarcoidosis with mediastinal and/or hilar adenopathy, we recommend that Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA be used for diagnosis (Grade 1C).",

      "title": "Diagnosis of TB",
      "content": "The increasing use of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA has led to its application in the diagnosis of nonneoplastic diseases such as TB. This question focuses on the value of incorporating Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA when other modalities are not diagnostic for TB. Three studies met our inclusion criteria and assessed the diagnostic yield of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) for the diagnosis of TB, although the diagnostic accuracy of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was not always the primary outcome measure. Garcia-Olivé et al 76 and Cetinkaya et al 84 analyzed the role of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for the assessment of mediastinal adenopathy with the majority of patients having a /uniFB01 nal diagnosis of lung cancer. Both studies had a high diagnostic yield (n ¼ 10, 80%; n ¼ 48, 79.2%), but the prevalence of TB was relatively low within the study population. Madan et al 80 reported their initial 1-year experience with Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA in a TB-endemic population. In their study, TB was diagnosed in nearly one-third of the patient population. Despite the fact that it was their early experience in Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, Madan et al 80 achieved a high yield of 84.8% for the diagnosis of TB. In the /uniFB01 rst two studies, the diagnosis of TB was reached either by positive acid-fast bacilli smears on the aspirate or the presence of necrotizing granuloma in the setting of positive tuberculin skin test results and appropriate clinical context. Madan et al 80 used the same criteria plus the GeneXpert MTB-RIF test (Cepheid) for the diagnosis of TB.\nAlthough we recommend that Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA be used for diagnosis in patients with suspected TB with mediastinal and/or hilar adenopathy, it must be noted that no single study assessed the role of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for the diagnosis of TB as the primary outcome measure. New technology such as Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA may not be readily available in developing countries where the prevalence of the disease is higher. Various diagnostic techniques are available for the diagnosis of TB and should be incorporated during the diagnostic evaluation.\n11. In patients with suspected tuberculosis with mediastinal and/or hilar adenopathy who require lymph node sampling, we recommend that Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA be used for diagnosis (Grade 1C).",

      "title": "Diagnosis of Lymphoma",
      "content": "Patients with lymphoma can present with isolated mediastinal adenopathy in which mediastinoscopy, thoracoscopy, or thoracotomy may traditionally have been required to obtain tissue diagnosis. These surgical procedures require general anesthetic, and the\npotential complications cannot be ignored. Conversely, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA can sample mediastinal and/or hilar lymph nodes in a minimally invasive way. Currently available Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA needles can be used to provide only cytologic specimens. There is controversy regarding the role of small-volume specimens for establishing a diagnosis of lymphoma, with reported high discordance between cytologic specimens and histologic specimens. We therefore looked at the role of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA in establishing the diagnosis of the various subtypes of lymphoma. Five studies with a total of 212 patients met our inclusion criteria and were assessed for diagnostic yield of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) for establishing a diagnosis of lymphoma. 85-89 All studies were retrospective case reviews of patients undergoing Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for suspected lymphoma. Although the pooled diagnostic accuracy was 68.7% (95% CI, 61.975.5), there was heterogeneity across studies in the proportion of patients with de novo lymphoma vs relapsed lymphoma. More than one-half of the patients had a history of lymphoma in the studies by Iqbal et al 85 and Kennedy et al. 86 Both studies showed higher diagnostic yield for the diagnosis of relapsed lymphoma compared with de novo lymphoma. Interestingly, the study by Iqbal et al 85 had the lowest overall diagnostic accuracy (ie, 38%).\nThe de /uniFB01 nition of diagnosis of lymphoma was also not uniform across the /uniFB01 ve studies. The two studies demonstrating the highest yield (Kennedy et al 86 [91%] and Moonim et al 87 [89%]) included cases as diagnostic even when additional tissue sampling was necessary to subclassify their lymphoma necessary for clinical management. With the strict criterion of achieving a de /uniFB01 nitive diagnosis on the basis of a specimen obtained by Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA suf /uniFB01 cient for clinical management, the diagnostic yield would drop to 72.7% and 79%, respectively.\nBecause treatment regimens for both non-Hodgkin ' s and Hodgkin ' s lymphoma depend on the speci /uniFB01 c subtype and histologic grade, a de /uniFB01 nitive diagnosis of lymphoma requires the evaluation of cell morphology, immunophenotype, and the overall architecture of the tissue. Diagnosis of Hodgkin ' s lymphoma by using cytologic samples is generally challenging, as Reed-Sternberg cells within the aspirates are usually scarce and evaluation of the overall background architecture is often impossible. This may explain the lower diagnostic yield in some of the studies. 11,15\nIn some conditions, minimally invasive Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA may be the preferred modality over surgical intervention. For example, repeat mediastinoscopy or even surgical biopsy posttreatment for relapsed lymphoma can be challenging, with a lower diagnostic yield and higher complication rate. Although the diagnostic yield of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for the diagnosis of lymphoma is not as high as that known for lung cancer staging, we suggest that Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA can be used as an initial, minimally invasive diagnostic test.\n12. In patients with suspected lymphoma, we suggest that Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA is an acceptable initial, minimally invasive diagnostic test (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement).",

      "content": "This report provides an evidence-based approach to the technical aspects of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA performance. Under the guidance of the CHEST methodologists, we applied a rigorous evidence-based process and explored all available literature on the chosen topics. For questions with an acceptable level of evidence, recommendations were developed with an assigned grade based on the strength and quality of the evidence. For questions that lacked suf /uniFB01 cient data, a consensus-based statement was generated from the expert knowledge of the panelists who have extensive clinical expertise and considerable investigative research in Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA.\nIt is worthwhile to highlight a few /uniFB01 ndings of this report. First, based on our current knowledge, various procedural details surrounding Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA are unlikely to in /uniFB02 uence the diagnostic yield and are left to institutional practices and operators ' preferences. Some aspects of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA require minimal standards that should be considered by the proceduralists (eg, number of needed passes, training). Second, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA is not only valuable in the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer but also in the investigation of sarcoidosis, TB, and lymphoma. Third, additional research is needed to address some of the questions we examined and found scant investigation, as well as to answer novel intriguing questions.\nBecause Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) technology will inevitably evolve and advance, this report should serve as a starting point for seeking and summarizing knowledge about the optimal performance of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA and should be updated regularly.\n]",
