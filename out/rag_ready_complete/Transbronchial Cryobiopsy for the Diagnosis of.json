      "title": "Summary of Recommendations",
      "content": "1. In patients with suspected interstitial lung disease (ILD), we suggest that transbronchial cryobiopsy (TBC) can be used to provide histopathologic /uniFB01 ndings for multidisciplinary discussion diagnosis (Weak Recommendation, Very Low-Quality Evidence).\nRemarks: The choice between TBC and surgical lung biopsy (SLB) should be based on local availability and expertise, bene /uniFB01 t-risk assessments, and patient preference following informed consent. In some instances, a nondiagnostic TBC may be followed by SLB or repeat TBC. In other cases, an SLB may be preferred. To date, the published data on safety and diagnostic yield for TBC have largely been con /uniFB01 ned to a relatively small, but increasing, number of specialized centers with established experience, which limits their external validity.\n2. In patients with suspected ILD undergoing TBC, we suggest biopsy of at least two different sites (either different segments in the same lobe or different lobes) (Weak Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence).\nRemarks: TBC of two sites is associated with a substantially higher risk of pneumothorax compared with TBC of one site (24.6% vs 15.2%). The risk of increased pneumothorax must be weighed against the bene /uniFB01 t of improved diagnostic yield, particularly in patients with advanced structural damage in the lung parenchyma.\n3. In patients with suspected ILD undergoing TBC, we suggest biopsy with the tip of the cryoprobe located\n1 cm from the pleura (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement).\nRemarks: This recommendation is based on histological considerations and safety. In cases of suspected IPF, the histological pattern is typically predominant in the subpleural areas. The distance from the pleura for biopsies was chosen to balance histological yield with the risks of pneumothorax and bleeding.\n4. In patients with suspected ILD undergoing TBC, we suggest the use of /uniFB02 uoroscopy (Ungraded ConsensusBased Statement).\nRemarks: Distance from the cryoprobe tip to the pleura can be inferred from the resistance felt when it reaches the pleura and from the distance measured on /uniFB02 uoroscopy when the beam is perpendicular to the axis of the cryoprobe. The routine use of /uniFB02 uoroscopy is suggested, and sampling of segments which allow for a more perpendicular beam path should be favored.\n5. In patients with suspected ILD undergoing TBC, we suggest that TBC be performed with a bronchial blocker either through an endotracheal tube or rigid bronchoscope (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement).\nRemarks: In the case of endobronchial bleeding, prophylactic placement of a bronchial blocker allows for immediate tamponade without further positioning maneuver. While we acknowledge that TBC via rigid bronchoscopy without prophylactic balloon placement may be considered when performed at expert centers, the systematic use of a bronchial blocker is suggested.\n6. In patients with suspected ILD undergoing TBC, we suggest the use of a small cryoprobe (1.9 mm) rather than a larger cryoprobe (2.4 mm) (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement).\nRemarks: The smaller diameter cryoprobe is easier to maneuver in the airway and facilitates tactile feedback of when the cryoprobe reaches the pleura, which may reduce the risk of bleeding and pneumothorax.",

An UIP pattern, whether in IPF, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or rheumatoid lung disease, is often associated with a poor outcome. 3-5\nInterstitial lung diseases present with diffuse parenchymal opacities on thoracic imaging. Highresolution CT scanning in patients with interstitial pneumonias demonstrates various patterns of parenchymal abnormalities, including characteristic combinations of ground-glass opacities, reticular opacities, and sometimes honeycombing. Prior studies correlating radiologic and histopathologic features have provided data that allow recognition of some histopathologic patterns based on imaging features (types of opacities and distribution) depicted on highresolution CT scanning. For example, basal and subpleural predominant distribution of reticular opacities with traction bronchiectasis and honeycombing without other features to suggest an alternative diagnosis, allows a con /uniFB01 dent diagnosis of UIP without histopathologic con /uniFB01 rmation. 6,7\nIn many ILD patients, the etiology of disease is uncertain, and a speci /uniFB01 c diagnosis cannot be made from typical imaging features, resulting in diagnostic and management uncertainty. For such patients, the current gold standard for establishing the underlying histopathologic pattern is a surgical lung biopsy (SLB). However, there is signi /uniFB01 cant mortality and morbidity associated with SLB, particularly for patients who may have UIP, are older than 65 years, have signi /uniFB01 cant lung impairment, or are experiencing an acute exacerbation of ILD. 8,9 The largest retrospective study published to date, comprising data from 2000 to 2011 in the United States, reported an inpatient mortality rate after SLB for ILD of 1.7% for elective procedures and 16% for\nnonelective procedures. 8 The same study estimated that approximately 12,000 such SLBs were performed annually during the study period.\nAs a general rule, conventional transbronchial forceps biopsies have not been considered suf /uniFB01 cient in this context except for speci /uniFB01 c case scenarios. 10 While histopathologic features of UIP may be identi /uniFB01 ed on transbronchial forceps biopsy specimens in hindsight and appear speci /uniFB01 c, the sensitivity of conventional forceps biopsies for UIP seems relatively low, around 30%. 11,12 Conversely, transbronchial forceps biopsies are very useful in some situations, which should not generally lead to consideration of surgical lung biopsy, such as in granulomatous diseases and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, for instance. 13 In some selected cases, however, SLB is still considered. 6,7 In recent years, transbronchial cryobiopsy (TBC) has been explored as an alternative to SLB. The proposed advantage of TBC is that it might provide clinically useful histopathologic /uniFB01 ndings (as biopsies are larger than standard bronchoscopic forceps biopsies and without crush artifact which often hinders pattern recognition) while being less invasive with lower risks of morbidity and mortality compared with SLB. To be an alternative to SLB, ideally TBC should provide a comparable diagnostic yield.\nAs TBC is increasingly adopted as a potential alternative to SLB for the diagnosis of ILD, concerns have been raised over the safety and utility of the procedure. 14-17 While expert recommendations 18 have been proposed before, methodologically robust guidance is needed to provide and update on current knowledge of the utility and safety of the procedure, its potential role in the diagnostic algorithm of ILD, and technical aspects of the procedure demonstrated to affect the diagnostic yield and safety of the procedure. The expert panel acknowledges that the following recommendations are largely based on weak evidence, should not be regarded as binding, and that individual clinicians should feel free to approach this issue in the context of the particular circumstances of their patient.",

In some instances, a nondiagnostic TBC may be followed by SLB or repeat TBC. In other cases, an SLB may be preferred. To date, the published data on safety and diagnostic yield for TBC have largely been con /uniFB01 ned to a relatively small, but increasing, number of specialized centers with established experience, which limits their external validity.\nFour observational studies comparing the diagnostic yield of TBC and SLB met inclusion criteria, including two prospective studies 17,27 and two retrospective studies. 28,29 A small prospective cohort study (n ¬º 21) compared the histological diagnostic yield of TBCs and SLBs performed sequentially in the same patients. 17 TBC was diagnostic in 17/21 (81%) cases and SLB was diagnostic in 21/21 (100%) of cases. Poor concordance between TBC and SLB was reported (kappa ¬º 0.22). The concordance of TBC and SLB with multidisciplinary discussion (MDD) diagnoses was fair (kappa ¬º 0.31 [95% CI, 0.06-0.56]) and moderate (kappa ¬º 0.51 [95% CI, 0.27-0.75]), respectively. These analyses included four TBCs which were nondiagnostic, and the study has been criticized for other limitations. 30 Another prospective multicenter cohort study (n ¬º 65) also compared histological diagnostic yields of TBCs and SLBs performed sequentially in the same patients. 27 Histopathologic agreement was 70.8% with good concordance (kappa ¬º 0.7) and for TBCs with high or de /uniFB01 nite diagnostic con /uniFB01 dence at MDD (39/65, 60% of cases), the concordance with SLB was 94.9%. In this study, high con /uniFB01 dence or de /uniFB01 nite /uniFB01 nal MDD diagnoses were reached in 39 (60%) of 65 TBCs compared with 48 (74%) of 65 SLBs ( P ¬º .090).\nTwo retrospective studies from the same institution and including overlapping patient populations also analyzed diagnostic yield but assessed different diagnostic outcomes. 28,29 In the /uniFB01 rst study, assessing diagnostic con /uniFB01 dence in the MDD diagnosis of IPF, 117 patients were evaluated; 58 underwent TBC and 59 underwent SLB. 29 Histopathologic diagnoses were achieved in 91% (53/58) of the TBC cohort and in 98% (58/59) of the SLB cohort with a higher con /uniFB01 dence of diagnosis of UIP in the SLB cohort (52% [21/40] vs 85% [35/41]; P ¬º .0015). Signi /uniFB01 cant increases in diagnostic con /uniFB01 dence upon MDD were reported after adding histological information from either TBC (29 to 63%; P ¬º .0003) or SLB (30 to 65%; P ¬º .0016) (e-Table 3a).\nThe second study, with a much larger cohort, assessed the comparative histopathologic diagnostic yield and\nsafety of TBC and SLB among 447 patients with ILD. 28 In this analysis, TBC was diagnostic in 246/297 (82.8%) compared with SLB, which was diagnostic in 148/150 (98.7%). This represents a signi /uniFB01 cantly different histopathologic diagnostic rate in favor of SLB ( P ¬º .013).\nTwo meta-analyses compared the diagnostic yields of TBC and SLB. 31,32 Sharp et al 31 found a histological diagnostic yield of 84.4% (95% CI, 76-91%) for TBC compared with a 91.1% yield for SLB (95% CI, 87-93%). Iftikhar et al 32 report yields for TBC and SLB of 83.7% (95% CI, 77-89%) and 92.7% (95% CI, 88-96%), respectively. The lesser yield of TBC in this analysis is hypothesized to be related to sampling error, rather than to a lesser reliability of the biopsy histological interpretation.\nFour additional observational studies (n ¬º 19-55 patients) retrieved by our search parameters evaluated the yield of TBC in achieving a diagnosis. 33-36 Together, with the Ravaglia et al 28 and Romagnoli et al 17 studies considered above, these six studies included 457 patients (range, 19-297) undergoing TBC for ILD.

Diagnostic yield outcome data from these studies were assessed to be low-quality evidence.\nFour additional observational studies that were not retrieved by our search criteria due to lack of SLB comparator or were excluded due to inclusion of patient populations that overlap with those of studies included in our analysis include an additional 651 patients (n ¬º 40-402) undergoing TBC for ILD. 37-40 Histopathologic diagnostic yields in these studies range from 73.4% to 87.8%. Similarly, additional systematic reviews of the histopathologic diagnostic yield of TBCs have also been published recently, albeit with considerable overlap of study populations with those of the studies included in this analysis. 28,41,42 These reviews report pooled diagnostic yields for TBC between 81% and 85.9%.\nEvidence of the comparative diagnostic yield and safety of TBC and SLB provided by the observational studies included in this analysis is of low to very low quality. These data suggest the histopathologic diagnostic yield of TBC is in the range of 80% or greater, consistently below that of SLB as quoted in the studies above (91.1%98.7%) and from a meta-analysis which showed a yield from SLB approaching 95% (e-Table 3c). 43\n[\n]",

The mortality rate due to adverse events after the biopsy procedure was lower in the TBC cohort than in the SLB cohort (1/297 [0.3%] vs 4/150 [2.7%]; P ¬º .045), with a relative risk of 0.13 (95% CI, 0.011.12).

      "content": "2. In patients with suspected ILD undergoing TBC, we suggest biopsy of at least two different sites (either different segments in the same lobe or different lobes) (Weak Recommendation, Low-Quality Evidence).\nRemarks: TBC of two sites is associated with a substantially higher risk of pneumothorax compared with TBC of one site (24.6% vs 15.2%). The risk of increased pneumothorax must be weighed against the bene /uniFB01 t of improved diagnostic yield, particularly in patients with advanced structural damage in the lung parenchyma.\nThe issue of histological heterogeneity in ILD was addressed by prior research on SLB. Several studies have demonstrated that interlobar histological variability was frequent in subjects with UIP when SLBs were performed in different lobes or on analysis of explant specimens from patients with UIP. 47,48 Usual interstitial pneumonia and nonspeci /uniFB01 c interstitial pneumonia were detected in different lobes of the same lung in up to 26% of cases. It is accordingly reasonable to infer from the surgical literature that TBCs obtained from different sites may mitigate the problem of sampling error. The need to biopsy different locations in the lung may be more relevant for TBC, as TBC samples are smaller than SLB samples.\nTwo observational studies compared the diagnostic yields of TBCs sampling one site and TBCs sampling multiple sites and met inclusion criteria. 40,49 Both studies suggest that TBCs obtained from at least two different sites (different segments of the same lobe or two lobes of the same lung) increase the diagnostic yield signi /uniFB01 cantly. In a prospective study, Ravaglia et al 49 enrolled 46 patients with suspected diffuse parenchymal lung disease. All patients underwent TBC using a 2.4 mm probe and a freezing time of 5 seconds. Patients were randomly assigned to group A (four samples obtained from the same segment) or group B (two\nsamples obtained from one segment and two samples obtained from a different segment of the same lobe). Analysis of the samples was performed sequentially, and pathologists reformulated their histopathologic diagnosis with the addition of each sample. The mean diagnostic yield of the procedure combining the two groups and considering only the /uniFB01 rst sample was 69%. When a second biopsy was performed in the same segment, the mean diagnostic yield improved to 78%, but this was not statistically signi /uniFB01 cant ( P ¬º .340). Only when the two samples were obtained from two different segments did the diagnostic yield increase signi /uniFB01 cantly to 96% ( P ¬º .004) (e-Table 5a). There were more pneumothoraces in group B vs A (6/23 vs 1/22), but this difference was not statistically signi /uniFB01 cant ( P ¬º .096) (eTable 5b).\nThese results were con /uniFB01 rmed by a retrospective analysis of a large cohort of 699 patients who underwent TBC. 40 Both histological (92.5% vs 84.8%; P ¬º .001) and MDD (92.9% vs 88.4%; P ¬º .43) diagnostic yields were signi /uniFB01 cantly better when samples were obtained from two sites (n ¬º 267, different segments of the same lobe [n ¬º 166; 62%] or different lobes [n ¬º 101; 38%]) compared with sampling of one site, respectively (eTable 5c). Both 2.4 mm and 1.9 mm probes were used, with no signi /uniFB01 cant differences in terms of histological (88% vs 84.9%, respectively; P ¬º .49) or MDD (90.6% vs 98.4%, respectively; P ¬º .201) diagnostic yield (e-Table 5d). The freezing time of the 2.4 mm probe was 5 seconds, and the freezing time of the 1.9 mm probe was 7 to 8 seconds. The risk of pneumothorax was increased when samples were taken from different sites (one site: 15.2%; two sites: 24.6%; P ¬º .002) (e-Table 5e).\nWhile these prospective and retrospective studies comparing diagnostic yield provide low-quality evidence, the available data suggest that TBC sampling from two sites (two segments or two lobes) compared with one site results in a higher diagnostic yield, although at the expense of more pneumothoraces.",

The distance from the pleura for\n[\n]\nbiopsies was chosen to balance histological yield with the risks of pneumothorax and bleeding.\nThe literature search did not return any studies that addressed the impact of differential distances of the cryoprobe from the pleura during TBC on diagnostic yield or safety. A suggested distance of the cryoprobe tip to the pleura of 1 cm is based on both histological and safety considerations. Diagnosis of IPF requires sampling at the level of the secondary lobule of the lung, which is typically located in close proximity to the pleura. Samples obtained 1 cm away from the pleural lining allow for adequate histological specimens while mitigating the risk of pneumothorax associated with more distal biopsies.

In patients with suspected ILD undergoing TBC, we suggest that TBC be performed with a bronchial blocker either through an endotracheal tube or rigid bronchoscope (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement).\nRemarks: In the case of endobronchial bleeding, prophylactic placement of a bronchial blocker allows for immediate tamponade without further positioning maneuver. While we acknowledge that TBC via rigid bronchoscopy without prophylactic balloon placement may be considered when performed at expert centers, the systematic use of a bronchial blocker is suggested.\nBleeding after TBC is common, and severe bleeding may occur. 38,42,51-53 The risk of severe bleeding is increased during TBC as each sample needs to be removed en-bloc with the bronchoscope (as the larger biopsy size precludes retrieval through the working channel of the bronchoscope), with the bronchoscope reinserted in the patient airway only after the sampled tissue has been released from the cryoprobe tip after thawing. This process results in the inability to keep the bronchoscope wedged after biopsy, a technique used to contain endobronchial bleeding after conventional forceps biopsies, and signi /uniFB01 cant blind time during which substantial endobronchial bleeding may go unnoticed.\nOne observational study addressing the in /uniFB02 uence of prophylactic bronchial blocker balloon use during TBC on the incidence of bleeding met inclusion criteria. 50 Moderate to severe bleeding, de /uniFB01 ned as bleeding requiring cold saline, postoperative mechanical ventilation, transfusion, or escalation of care, occurred in /uniFB01 ve of 14 patients (35.7%) who underwent TBC without prophylactic balloon placement. The incidence of such bleeding was signi /uniFB01 cantly lower in patients who underwent TBC with prophylactic balloon placement (2/ 114 [1.8%]; P < .001) (e-Table 6b).\nThis evidence suggests prophylactic balloon placement may mitigate the risk of bleeding during TBC and increase the safety of the procedure. Preferably, the balloon is placed in the segment feeding the target area and pushed down beside the bronchoscope within the rigid bronchoscope or through an extra channel attached to the /uniFB02 exible tube. 54,55 Rigid bronchoscopy is preferred by some for its ability to control endobronchial bleeding, but when used with jet ventilation could theoretically increase the risk of\niatrogenic pneumothorax. The balloon is in /uniFB02 ated immediately after the cryoprobe and bronchoscope are retrieved en-bloc from the airway. The amount of in /uniFB02 ation needed, and the integrity of the bronchial blocker, should be established before the biopsy is obtained.",

Conversely, a substantial body of evidence suggests that SLB, with an estimated 12,000 procedures performed annually for ILD in the United States alone, is associated with signi /uniFB01 cant morbidity and mortality. 8 While the use of SLB is increasingly questioned in the ILD community, recent guidelines on IPF continue to recommend SLB as a possible option in patients with possible UIP/IPF when the diagnosis cannot be established on radiologic grounds alone. 6,7 TBC appears to be safer than SLB, and its contribution to the diagnosis following MDD is essentially equivalent to that of SLB when local expertise (clinicians, radiologists, and pathologists) is available. Our comprehensive and systematic review of the literature suggests that TBC may be considered as an alternative to SLB, provided certain precautions are exercised, such as prophylactic use of a bronchial blocker and /uniFB02 uoroscopy. These recommendations should be viewed as provisional, and contingent upon con /uniFB01 rmation of these preliminary data and the availability of clinical pathologist experts in ILD.",
