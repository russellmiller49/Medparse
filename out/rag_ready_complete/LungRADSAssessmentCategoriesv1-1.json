      "title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "content": "Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related death in the United States and worldwide. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated a 20% reduction in lung-cancer-related mortality with the use of lowdose lung cancer screening (LCS) CT in high-risk patients [1,2]. More recent data from the randomized controlled Dutch-Belgian Randomized Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NELSON) and Multicentric Italian Lung Detection trial reaf /uniFB01 rm the utility of LCS CT, reporting lung-cancerspeci /uniFB01 c mortality reductions of up to 26% and 39%, respectively [3,4]. In conjunction with the CMS approval for coverage of LCS CT in eligible patients, the ACR released the Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) v1.0 in 2014 to standardize LCS CT reporting, provide consistent management guidance, and facilitate outcomes monitoring [5].\nSpeci /uniFB01 c aspects of Lung-RADS have been validated in numerous studies with the primary bene /uniFB01 ts of survival associated with a shift to earlier-stage lung cancer detection (stage shift) and reducing false-positive screens and unnecessary follow-up [6-14]. There has been widespread adoption of Lung-RADS for LCS CT reporting throughout the United States as the only CMS-approved reporting and classi /uniFB01 cation system for LCS. Lung-RADS has also been implemented in other countries or used as a foundation for international reporting systems [15,16].\nLung-RADS was updated to v1.1 in 2019 adding classi/uniFB01 cation criteria for peri /uniFB01 ssural nodules, new size criteria for nonsolid nodules, and revised measurement criteria, among other updates [17,18]. The newest version, Lung-RADS v2022, was released in November 2022, coinciding with National Lung Cancer Awareness month [19]. This release was prepared by the ACR Lung-RADS Committee, composed of 15 content experts from the /uniFB01 elds of diagnostic radiology, thoracic surgery, and pulmonary medicine representing a range of clinical practice settings. The updates were informed by new science, questions raised by practicing radiologists, and insights from committee members. Each topic underwent a systematic review of the literature, resulting in evidence-based updates when supported, including new assessment criteria for atypical pulmonary cysts and juxtapleural nodules, as well as revised assessment criteria for\nairway nodules and potentially infectious or in /uniFB02 ammatory /uniFB01 ndings at LCS. For topics of clinical importance lacking suf /uniFB01 cient data, expert consensus was obtained through nominal group methodology to establish best practice guidance for commonly encountered clinical scenarios in LCS CT practice. This article, authored by the ACR Lung-RADS Committee, details the updates along with the evidence and rationale for changes introduced in Lung-RADS v2022 (Table 1).",

      "title": "NEW CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA Atypical Pulmonary Cysts",
      "content": "The incidence of lung cancers associated with atypical pulmonary cysts is overall low, with the largest study indicating a rate of 1.1% for new lung cancer diagnoses [20]. However, the incidence of cystic lung cancers in high-risk populations is much higher. In evaluating International Early Lung Cancer Action Program data, Farooqi et al found that of 706 patients with lung cancers, 3.6% were associated with cysts at either baseline or follow-up LCS [21]. A study of 441 patients diagnosed with primary lung cancer found that 9.3% were associated with cystic components at initial CT imaging [22]. Furthermore, cancers associated with cysts are more likely to be missed at initial screening than those presenting as isolated nodules. In a NELSON analysis, 22% of missed cancers at initial screening were associated with cystic spaces [23].\nPrecursor lesions of cystic lung cancers are often represented by unilocular thick-walled cysts, cysts with associated nodularity, or multilocular cysts [22]. A meta-analysis of eight studies evaluating lung cancers associated with cystic airspaces in 341 patients found that the most common cystic imaging features were nonuniform shape (91.2%), associated nodular component (64.0%), unilocular cyst (63.6%), wall thickening (37.4%), and irregular margins (37.3%) [24]. Over time, imaging demonstrated nodule growth (68.5%), an increase in wall thickening (48.3%), enlargement of the cystic component (40.4%), or transformation to a completely solid nodule (12.4%). When associated with lung cancer, unilocular cysts typically present with additional features, such as wall thickening or nodularity [24-26]. Multilocular cysts have a\nhigh probability of malignancy and are reported to account for up to 20% of cystic lung cancers [25]. Given these /uniFB01 ndings, Lung-RADS v2022 introduces classi /uniFB01 cation and management recommendations for atypical pulmonary cysts detected at LCS (Table 2). Key principles are as follows:\n1. Thin-walled cysts, de /uniFB01 ned as unilocular cysts with wall thickness < 2 mm, are considered benign and are not classi /uniFB01 ed or managed in Lung-RADS [27]. Multiple pulmonary cysts may indicate a diffuse cystic lung disease; however, these conditions are not classi /uniFB01 ed in Lung-RADS unless a cyst with concerning features is identi /uniFB01 ed (Fig. 1).\n2. Thick-walled cysts are unilocular with a wall thickness 2 mm or larger, which may be uniform, asymmetric, or manifest as focal wall nodularity (Fig. 2).\n3. Multilocular cysts contain internal septations and may have associated ground glass or solid components (Fig. 3).\n4. Thick-walled and multilocular cysts are classi /uniFB01 ed as Lung-RADS 4A with recommended management of 3month low-dose CT (LDCT) or PET/CT if there is a solid component of at least 8 mm.\n5. Growing wall thickness or nodularity of a thick-walled cyst, increasing loculation of a multilocular cyst, or new or increasing opacity (nodular, ground glass, or consolidation) within or adjacent to a multilocular cyst merits a 4B classi /uniFB01 cation with a recommendation for appropriate diagnostic evaluation (Fig. 3).\n6. Atypical pulmonary cysts with an associated nodule that is within the cyst lumen (endophytic) or adjacent to the wall (exophytic) are classi /uniFB01 ed and managed by the most suspicious /uniFB01 nding. It can be dif /uniFB01 cult to distinguish between a cyst with nodular wall thickening (eg, a thick-walled cyst, LungRADS 4A) and a thin-walled cyst with an adjacent nodule (managed by nodule size and composition). When in doubt, choose the higher Lung-RADS classi /uniFB01 cation (Fig. 4).\n*Refer to the complete Lung-RADS v2022 Assessment Category table and notes: https://www.acr.org/-/media/ACR/Files/RADS/Lung-RADS/ Lung-RADS-2022.pdf.\nThe precise risk of malignancy for atypical pulmonary cysts is not well de /uniFB01 ned. The ACR Lung-RADS Committee therefore chose to remove the Risk of Malignancy column from the Lung-RADS table. Risk assessment is typically lesion speci /uniFB01 c and, with the exception of category 4B lesions, is not routinely used in Lung-RADS management recommendations.",

      "title": "Juxtapleural Nodules",
      "content": "Lung-RADS v1.1 introduced new classi /uniFB01 cation and management recommendations for screen-detected peri /uniFB01 ssural nodules meeting the following size and morphologic criteria: solid; triangular, ovoid, or lentiform in shape; and measuring < 10 mm in maximum diameter. Such nodules are considered benign and likely to represent intrapulmonary lymph nodes with several studies indicating a 0% incidence of malignancy [28,29]. New studies indicate that up to 32% of solid nodules 6 to 10 mm in mean diameter are juxtapleural (peri /uniFB01 ssural, costal pleural, perimediastinal, or peridiaphragmatic) and that no juxtapleural nodules were malignant when applying similar size and morphologic criteria as those used for peri /uniFB01 ssural nodules [30-32]. Of note, some of the analyses used a 10mm mean diameter (average of longand short-axis diameters) rather than a single maximum diameter threshold; Lung-RADS v2022 criteria have been updated accordingly. Available data indicate that expanding peri /uniFB01 ssural classi /uniFB01 -cation and management recommendations to all juxtapleural nodules, regardless of location, reduces false-positive rates and increases Lung-RADS speci /uniFB01 city without a decrease in sensitivity (Fig. 5).",

      "content": "Classi /uniFB01 cation and management of potentially infectious or in /uniFB02 ammatory /uniFB01 ndings were not addressed in Lung-RADS v1.0. Lung-RADS v1.1 introduced a new management\nrecommendation of 1-month LDCT for ' new large nodules that develop on an annual repeat screening CT ' to address potentially infectious or in /uniFB02 ammatory conditions. Precise size and composition guidance were not speci /uniFB01 ed, but the management recommendation was provided under category 4B, suggesting that nodules meeting classi /uniFB01 cation criteria for new 4B nodules may apply. Lung-RADS v2022 provides new guidance on /uniFB01 ndings that are likely to be in /uniFB02 ammatory or infectious, how to classify them, and what constitutes appropriate management (Fig. 6).\nThe precise incidence of in /uniFB02 ammatory or infectious pulmonary pathology at LCS is unknown; however, one series of 3,800 patients found that 8.1% of LCS examinations had /uniFB01 ndings attributable to in /uniFB02 ammatory or infectious etiologies and that most resolved at follow-up imaging with a < 1% incidence of malignancy [33]. This same series found that in /uniFB02 ammatory or infectious /uniFB01 ndings were predominantly multifocal (78.5%) and comprised of ground glass (46.8%), clustered opacities (20.2%), tree-inbud nodules (16.9%), or consolidation (12.4%). In addition, segmental or lobar consolidation, multiple new nodules (more than six), large solid nodules ( /C21 8 mm) appearing in a short interval, and new nodules in certain clinical contexts (eg, immunocompromised patient) are likely to be infectious or in /uniFB02 ammatory [34-36]. Because the appearance of potentially infectious or in /uniFB02 ammatory pulmonary conditions is heterogeneous, the data do not dictate a single classi /uniFB01 cation and management recommendation. Lung-RADS v2022 provides the following guidance:\n1. Findings at LCS suggesting an indeterminate infectious or in /uniFB02 ammatory process, as previously noted, or /uniFB01 ndings that obscure portions of the lungs, such as segmental or lobar consolidation, should be classi /uniFB01 ed as Lung-RADS 0 with a recommendation for 1- to 3-month follow-up LDCT to allow time for resolution and to exclude an underlying suspicious nodule. At follow-up, the study\nshould be reclassi /uniFB01 ed based on the most concerning /uniFB01 nding.\n2. Findings at LCS in which malignancy seems more likely than an infectious or in /uniFB02 ammatory process should be classi /uniFB01 ed based on size and composition. Such /uniFB01 ndings are often new solid or part-solid nodules that meet LungRADS 4B size criteria with recommended management of diagnostic or clinical evaluation.\n3. Some /uniFB01 ndings at LCS indicative of an infectious process may not warrant short-term follow-up (eg, tree-in-bud nodules or new < 3-cm ground glass nodules). These nodules may be evaluated using existing size and composition criteria with a Lung-RADS classi /uniFB01 cation and management recommendation based on the most suspicious /uniFB01 nding, often corresponding to Lung-RADS 2 with a recommendation for 12-month LDCT.",

      "title": "Airway Nodules",
      "content": "Although rare, patients eligible for LCS have risk factors for developing primary airway squamous cell carcinoma. Scrutiny of the airways at LCS is an important component of a comprehensive imaging evaluation. Data characterizing airway /uniFB01 ndings at LCS are limited. In the largest study to date, Kim et al evaluated 50,036 patients undergoing LCS CT and found that only 0.6% had airway nodules [37]. The majority of endobronchial opacities resolved at repeat imaging (96.2%); of those that did not resolve, bronchoscopic evaluation found that all represented benign pathology with no cases of malignancy identi /uniFB01 ed. A smaller study found airway nodules in 0.5% of LCS examinations, and 97.8% of these were benign [38]. Although the incidence of airway malignancies at screening is very low, an analysis\nof the NELSON data found that 22% of cancers missed at initial screening presented as central endobronchial lesions, indicating that attention to airway /uniFB01 ndings is clinically important [23].\nLung-RADS v1.0 and v1.1 categorized the presence of an endobronchial nodule as category 4A with a 3month follow-up LDCT recommended; however, no additional management guidance was provided for persistent nodules at the time of follow-up imaging. In some instances, persistent nodules were being downgraded to Lung-RADS 2 as recommended for ' Category 3 or 4 nodules unchanged for /C21 3 months '-management intended for pulmonary nodules rather than airway nodules. Lung-RADS v2022 provides additional\nguidance on the classi /uniFB01 cation and management of airway /uniFB01 ndings at LCS, taking into consideration location, morphology, number, and persistence at follow-up imaging (Table 3).\n1. Location: Large airways are de /uniFB01 ned as segmental or more proximal in nature and have diameters > 3 mm [39]. Such airway nodules may be classi /uniFB01 ed as Lung-RADS 4A with a management recommendation of 3-month LDCT follow-up to assess for resolution versus persistence. Evaluation of the small airways (subsegmental and more distal) is limited at LCS but can manifest as postobstructive atelectasis or other secondary imaging /uniFB01 ndings not readily assessed on screening CT, such as air\ntrapping. Subsegmental airway nodules often represent mucous plugging or are associated with infectious or in /uniFB02 ammatory conditions and can be classi /uniFB01 ed as LungRADS 2 with a management recommendation of 12month screening LDCT (Fig. 7).\n2. Morphology: Although differentiating between airway neoplasms and secretions at initial imaging can be challenging, shape and density are important morphologic features that can be considered before assigning a Lung-RADS category. CT /uniFB01 ndings that favor secretions include complex or tubular shape, the absence of soft tissue, the presence of air, or Houns/uniFB01 eld unit < 21.7 and may be classi /uniFB01 ed as Lung-RADS 2 with a recommendation for 12-month screening LDCT [40]. Other CT features are indeterminate and may be classi /uniFB01 ed as Lung-RADS 4A with a\nrecommendation for 3-month LDCT follow-up to ensure resolution (Fig. 7).\n3. Number: Most malignant airway nodules are solitary [41]. Multiple airway opacities, such as new tree-in-bud nodules or multifocal mucoid impaction, favor a nonneoplastic process, may not necessarily warrant a LungRADS 4A classi /uniFB01 cation, and could be managed as a potentially infectious or in /uniFB02 ammatory process as previously outlined (Fig. 7).\n4. Persistence: Most benign central airway /uniFB01 ndings resolve at short-term follow-up; therefore, segmental or more proximal airway nodules that persist at 3-month LDCT follow-up are potentially concerning and should not be downgraded to a lower Lung-RADS category as is recommended for other stable 4A /uniFB01 ndings. Persistent segmental or more proximal airway nodules require\nadditional evaluation and are upgraded to category 4B for diagnostic assessment by PET/CT (if a solid component /C21 8 mm) or referral for clinical evaluation and bronchoscopy (Fig. 7).\nOf note, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network management guidelines for airway nodules found at LCS recommend a 1-month follow-up CT instead of a 3-month follow-up CT as recommended by Lung-RADS v2022 [42]. Both recommend subsequent bronchoscopy for persistent nodules. Given the low incidence of malignancy in airway lesions found at LCS and the relative minimal difference in timing, there is currently insuf /uniFB01 cient data to indicate which management recommendation may be preferable.",

Despite the potential bene /uniFB01 ts, there are currently no data to suggest that the use of volumetrics leads to improved patient outcomes over mean diameter measurement methodologies. In fact, in the only study to date comparing the performance of Lung-RADS versus the NELSON classi /uniFB01 cation and management criteria, LungRADS mean diameter assessment outperformed volumetrics at lung cancer detection [46]. Lung-RADS will appropriately evolve as new data regarding the utility and impact of volumetrics become available.",

      "content": "Nodule growth in both Lung-RADS v1.0 and 1.1 was de /uniFB01 ned as an increase in size > 1.5 mm but did not specify whether this was in any dimension, total diameter, or mean diameter, and Lung-RADS v1.0 and 1.1 did not specify a time interval (eg, growth rate) [17]. In practice, growth rate is an important consideration; for example, an increase in size of 2.0 mm over 6 months is potentially more concerning than over 2 years. Likewise, slowgrowing nodules that increase in size < 1.5 mm each year may be missed by prior Lung-RADS criteria. However, using a /uniFB01 xed dimension and time interval for assessing growth is not without limitations. For example, an increase of > 1.5 mm can represent a more signi /uniFB01 cant increase in size and volume in a small nodule than for similar growth in a large nodule; notwithstanding, growing small nodules are often still typically below the size threshold for biopsy or PET/CT characterization and may be safely managed by current Lung-RADS criteria. For larger nodules, the updated growth de /uniFB01 nition captures nodules that fall within concerning volume doubling times with 3and 6-month follow-up intervals. Volumetric analysis may more accurately detect subtle changes in nodule size than mean diameter measurements, leading to earlier intervention or diagnosis, but whether such /uniFB01 ndings lead to improved patient outcomes remain in question.\nThe ACR Lung-RADS Committee reviewed several methods and thresholds for assessing nodule growth but ultimately decided to maintain the > 1.5-mm marker while specifying a growth interval within 12 months. When modeled for nodules of varying size, this de /uniFB01 nition approximates other methodologies for quantifying\ngrowth, including those from the International Early Lung Cancer Action Program and the NELSON trial [47-49]. In addition, Lung-RADS v2022 provides\nadditional clarity for clinical application, particularly for slow-growing nodules. The following guidance is provided:\n1. Growth is de /uniFB01 ned as > 1.5-mm mean diameter increase within a /C20 12-month interval.\n2. Nodules with a /C20 1.5-mm increase in size in a > 12-month interval are de /uniFB01 ned as slow-growing, meaning they do not meet growth criteria from one annual screen to the next.\n3. Slow-growing nodules may be appropriately classi /uniFB01 ed as stable until reaching a new size threshold when they should be reclassi /uniFB01 ed and managed accordingly.\n4. Radiologists are advised to always compare the current examination with the oldest available chest CT (diagnostic or screening) to determine a nodule ' s characteristics over time.\n5. Slow-growing nonsolid (ground glass) nodules: A slowgrowing nonsolid nodule may be classi /uniFB01 ed as LungRADS 2 until the nodule meets criteria of another category, such as developing a solid component (then manage per part-solid nodule criteria).\nFig. 6. Infectious or in /uniFB02 ammatory /uniFB01 ndings. (A) Findings at lung cancer screening (LCS) that suggest an infectious or in /uniFB02 ammatory process include new segmental or lobar consolidation (A1, arrow), large new nodules ( /C21 8 mm) appearing within a short interval (A2, arrow), or multiple new nodules (A3). Such /uniFB01 ndings may be classi /uniFB01 ed as Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) 0 based on clinical suspicion of an infectious or in /uniFB02 ammatory process with a recommendation for follow-up low-dose CT (LDCT) in 1 to 3 months to ensure resolution. The study is then reclassi /uniFB01 ed at follow-up according to the most concerning /uniFB01 nding. (B) A 55-year-old patient had a baseline LCS CT classi /uniFB01 ed as Lung-RADS 3 (not shown) and presents for 6month follow-up LDCT. There is a new lobular 28-mm mean diameter soft tissue nodule in the left lower lobe (B1, arrow). Given the size and lack of an abnormality in this area on the prior examination, the study was classi /uniFB01 ed as Lung-RADS 0 for a likely infectious process. The patient returned for follow-up LDCT at 3 months, which showed a marked decrease in size but not complete resolution (B2, arrow). No new /uniFB01 ndings were identi /uniFB01 ed, and other nodules were stable. The examination was reclassi /uniFB01 ed as Lung-RADS 2 with a management recommendation of a 12-month LCS CT from the date of the current study. Had the nodule remained stable, increased, or only slightly decreased in size, an infectious or in /uniFB02 ammatory process would be less likely; the examination would be reclassi /uniFB01 ed as Lung-RADS 4B based on size and composition with a recommendation for diagnostic evaluation. (C) A 61-year-old patient presenting for annual LCS CT is found to have multiple new tree-in-bud nodules bilaterally with a basilar predominance (C2) relative to the prior annual LCS examination (C1). Although an infectious process is most likely, a Lung-RADS 0 classi /uniFB01 cation with 1- to 3-month follow-up LDCT is unnecessary. In this case, the examination may be classi /uniFB01 ed based on the size and composition of the new nodules (solid, < 4 mm), corresponding to Lung-RADS 2.\n6. Slow-growing solid or part-solid nodules: A solid or part-solid nodule demonstrating slow growth over multiple screening examinations is suspicious and may be classi /uniFB01 ed as Lung-RADS 4B. Slow-growing nodules may not have increased metabolic activity on PET/CT; therefore, biopsy, if feasible, or surgical evaluation may be the most appropriate management recommendation.",

Such /uniFB01 ndings are common with 19.6% of NLST study participants having potentially signi /uniFB01 cant pathology, although other studies have reported an incidence of 10% to 45% [33,50-52]. Unlike the highly structured classi /uniFB01 cation for lung nodules at LCS, /uniFB01 ndings that warrant an S modi /uniFB01 er and associated management are not prescribed by Lung-\nRADS and are left to the discretion of the interpreting radiologist. Although some authors have proposed more de /uniFB01 ned criteria, the classi /uniFB01 cation and management of incidental /uniFB01 ndings unrelated to lung cancer are beyond the purview of Lung-RADS [53]. Notwithstanding, LungRADS v2022 provides additional guidance and clari /uniFB01 cation for reporting signi /uniFB01 cant or potentially signi /uniFB01 cant /uniFB01 ndings.\n1. The interpreting radiologist determines which /uniFB01 ndings constitute a signi /uniFB01 cant or potentially signi /uniFB01 cant /uniFB01 nding (S modi /uniFB01 er). The reporting and communication of such /uniFB01 ndings should adhere to ACR practice standards.\n2. Management recommendations for the S modi /uniFB01 er should be included in the report impression and conform to established ACR Incidental Findings recommendations, when available. A reference guide summarizing ACR management recommendations for commonly encountered incidental /uniFB01 ndings at LCS is available [54,55].\nFig. 7. Airway nodules. (A) Airway nodules in Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) v2022 are characterized by location, morphology, number, and persistence. New segmental or more proximal airway nodules with a lack of benign features are classi /uniFB01 ed as Lung-RADS 4A with a recommendation of 3-month low-dose CT (LDCT) to assess for resolution (A1: left main stem nodule [arrow], A2: left lower lobe segmental bronchus nodule [arrow]). Subsegmental airway nodules are classi /uniFB01 ed as LungRADS 2 (A3: baseline lung cancer screening [LCS] with patent subsegmental airway [arrow], A4: annual LCS CT with new subsegmental airway nodule [arrow]). (B) The presence of air within an airway nodule, speci /uniFB01 cally in the absence of a soft tissue component, with mean attenuation < 21 Houns /uniFB01 eld units favors secretions (B1, B2, B3 [arrows]). Multiple tubular airway opacities favor mucous plugging (B4, arrows). These /uniFB01 ndings may be classi /uniFB01 ed as Lung-RADS 2. (C) A 70-year-old patient with a left main stem bronchus soft tissue nodule at annual LCS (C1, arrow) is classi /uniFB01 ed as Lung-RADS 4A and is stable at 3-month LDCT (C2, arrow). Airway nodules that persist at follow-up remain suspicious and are upgraded to Lung-RADS 4B with a recommendation for diagnostic evaluation, typically referral for clinical evaluation and bronchoscopy.\n3. Signi /uniFB01 cant or potentially signi /uniFB01 cant /uniFB01 ndings that are already known, treated, or in the process of clinical evaluation do not require an S modi /uniFB01 er (for example, a patient with severe coronary artery disease who has already undergone percutaneous coronary intervention). However, any evidence of change in a known /uniFB01 nding that is unexpected warrants an S modi /uniFB01 er, such as interval enlargement of a known ascending aortic aneurysm. It is not always evident whether a signi /uniFB01 cant or potentially signi /uniFB01 cant /uniFB01 nding is already known; therefore, radiologists should exercise judgment in reporting and communicating such /uniFB01 ndings and associated management recommendations.",

      "title": "Stepped Management",
      "content": "The concept of stepped management was /uniFB01 rst introduced in Lung-RADS v1.0 as category 3 or 4A nodules ' unchanged for /C21 3 months ' were downgraded to Lung-RADS category 2 with a management recommendation to ' continue annual screening with LDCT in 12 months ' [18]. Some radiologists interpreted this recommendation as 12 months from the current examination, but others adhered to 12 months from the baseline or annual LCS study. The\noriginal intent was for annual LCS to be performed 12 months from the date of the baseline examination, as the NLST validated this protocol in reducing lung cancer mortality with LCS CT [1]. With this approach, a baseline Lung-RADS 3 nodule stable at 6-month followup is reclassi /uniFB01 ed to category 2 with a return to annual screening in 6 months from the current examination (12 months from the baseline study). In practice, targeting follow-up recommendations from the baseline or annual screening examination can be problematic. Patients may not always comply with follow-up recommendations, and some were being imaged at later time points, such as 9 months from baseline. In such a case, a patient reclassi /uniFB01 ed as LungRADS 2 would be expected to return in 3 months for annual LCS. Similar dif /uniFB01 culties were encountered in managing category 4A (suspicious) nodules stable at 3-month follow-up CT. Such nodules were reclassi /uniFB01 ed as category 2, and patients would not return to imaging for 9 months -a longer follow-up interval than that recommended for stable probably benign category 3 nodules (return to imaging at 6 months), which was paradoxical.\nThere are limited data on the impact of screening intervals. As previously noted, the reduction in lung cancer mortality in the NLST was predicated on annual CT screening. The NELSON study examined staggered\nLDCT ¼ low-dose CT; Lung-RADS ¼ Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System.\nLDCT ¼ low-dose CT; Lung-RADS ¼ Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System. *Classi\n/uniFB01 cation and management are based on the most concerning nodule at follow-up. The classi /uniFB01 cation and management recommendations above assume no new or growing nodules are identi /uniFB01 ed.\nscreening follow-up at 1, 3, and 5.5 years from baseline (1-, 2-, and 2.5-year intervals) and found an increase in cancers at longer screening intervals, with a statistically signi /uniFB01 cant reduction in LCS ef /uniFB01 cacy at the 2.5-year interval [56]. At least two studies have been performed evaluating the Lung-RADS management follow-up intervals for 4A nodules /uniFB01 nding the initial 3-month recommendation is optimal, but downgrading stable 4A nodules to Lung-RADS 2 is potentially problematic, as previously discussed [14,57]. To address these concerns, Lung-RADS v2022 modi /uniFB01 es stepped management using the following guidelines:\n1. Nodules that are stable or decreased at follow-up are downgraded to the next lower Lung-RADS category.\n2. Nodules that completely resolve or are proven benign after an appropriate diagnostic evaluation are reclassi /uniFB01 ed based on the most concerning /uniFB01 nding.\n3. Follow-up recommendations are timed from the current examination.\nStepped management recommendations are listed in Table 4 with comparative management between LungRADS v1.1 and Lung-RADS v2022 outlined in Fig. 8. In application, a category 3 nodule that is stable or smaller at 6-month follow-up CT will be reclassi /uniFB01 ed as category 2, with a 12-month screening CT from the date of the current examination. Therefore, in Lung-RADS v2022, the patient is imaged 6 months later than in Lung-RADS v1.1 (Fig. 8A). In the small percentage of these nodules representing lung cancer, stepped management still allows for early detection and is unlikely to affect patient outcomes.\nStepped management for a category 4A nodule that is stable or smaller at 3-month follow-up CT results in reclassi /uniFB01 cation to category 3, with a 6-month LDCT from the date of the current study. If the nodule is stable or smaller at the 6-month examination, it is reclassi /uniFB01 ed as category 2 with a recommendation for 12-month screening LDCT from the date of the current examination (Fig. 8B). If the nodule resolves at the initial 3-month follow-up CT, and no new or growing nodules are identi /uniFB01 ed, then the\nstudy is reclassi /uniFB01 ed as category 1 or 2, without an intervening stepped management to category 3. Likewise, category 4B lesions that are proven benign after diagnostic evaluation can be reclassi /uniFB01 ed as category 1 or 2 depending on the presence of other stable nodules. As LCS and followup examinations are classi /uniFB01 ed in Lung-RADS according to the most concerning /uniFB01 nding, new or growing nodules supersede this approach. Stepped management in Lung-RADS v2022 provides consistent recommendations for the followup of category 3 and 4A nodules and addresses the 4A timing paradox of more concerning nodules.",

Although follow-up LDCT examinations obtained from Lung-RADS category 0 (1-3 month), 3 (6-month), and 4A (3-month) /uniFB01 ndings are considered DCTs based on current procedural terminology billing codes, for the purposes of this discussion, interval DCT refers to chest CT imaging performed outside LCS follow-up recommendations. To date, there has been no formal guidance on how to account for interval DCTs obtained in screening patients. Given that the /uniFB01 ndings on DCT are potentially relevant and may impact the timing of annual LCS, we offer the following guidance:\n1. Use of prior diagnostic CTs when evaluating a baseline LCS CT: Information from prior DCTs should be evaluated when interpreting baseline LCS and determining classi/uniFB01 cation and management recommendations. For example, an 8-mm solid nodule on baseline screening CT would typically be classi /uniFB01 ed as Lung-RADS 4A; however, if a prior diagnostic CT is available from 1 year ago documenting stability, then the baseline LCS examination can appropriately be classi /uniFB01 ed as Lung-RADS 2. Likewise, if the 8-mm nodule is new from 1 year ago, then the appropriate classi /uniFB01 cation would be Lung-RADS 4B (new /C21 8-mm solid nodule).\n2. Use of prior (interval) diagnostic CTs when evaluating an annual LCS or follow-up LDCT: Information from interval DCTs should be evaluated in conjunction with prior LCS and follow-up LDCT examinations for interpretation and determining classi /uniFB01 cation and management recommendations.\n3. Use of interval diagnostic CT as a substitute for annual LCS CT: A DCT may be used as a substitute for annual (not baseline) LCS if the examination is of suf /uniFB01 cient diagnostic quality and meets technical parameters of LCS CT with the exception of dose. If known prospectively, the DCT report should indicate that the study is also being performed as an annual LCS assessment and include a\nLung-RADS classi /uniFB01 cation and management recommendation. Alternatively, a DCT can include a Lung-RADS classi /uniFB01 cation and management recommendation as an addendum, with follow-up imaging timed from the date of the study.

CMS eligibility criteria exclude patients beyond the age of 77 [60]. Patients who initially quali /uniFB01 ed for annual LCS may eventually be ineligible as a result of age or smoking quit time longer than 15 years [60]. Patients who are no longer able or willing to receive treatment if a cancer is diagnosed, or whose life expectancy is limited, are also no longer eligible for LCS CT. Continued eligibility is best determined by the ordering provider. For patients who are no longer eligible for continued LCS, expert consensus among the ACR Lung-RADS Committee recommends the following:\n1. The interpreting radiologist should assign an appropriate Lung-RADS classi /uniFB01 cation and corresponding management recommendation based on the current examination, even if the patient may not be eligible for continued screening (eg, aging out, quit smoking > 15 years).\n2. We recommend adding a statement to LCS reporting templates indicating that the management recommendation is based on continued patient eligibility for annual LCS. This approach should avoid the need for addended reports and, more importantly, facilitate shared decision-making discussions between patients and providers in situations in which a recommendation for continued screening is made in the report, yet the patient no longer meets eligibility criteria or no longer quali /uniFB01 es for other reasons.\nThere are currently no consensus guidelines on subsequent management for patients who no longer qualify for annual LCS but have known lung nodules; however, many practices apply Fleischner Society nodule management recommendations for high-risk patients.
