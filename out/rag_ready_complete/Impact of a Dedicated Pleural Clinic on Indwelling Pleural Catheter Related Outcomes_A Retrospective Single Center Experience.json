Indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) are tunneled catheters that allow ambulatory intermittent drainage of pleural fluid without repeated thoracentesis. Despite the efficacy and safety of IPCs, data supporting postplacement follow-up is limited and variable. Our study aims to characterize the impact of a dedicated pleural clinic (PC) on patient outcomes as they relate to IPCs. METHODS: Patients who underwent IPC placement between 2015 and 2021 were included in this retrospective study. Differences in outcomes were analyzed between patients with an IPC placed and managed by Interventional Pulmonology (IP) through the PC and those placed by non-IP services (non-PC providers) before and after the PC implementation. RESULTS: In total, 371 patients received IPCs. Since the implementation of the PC, there was an increase in ambulatory IPC placement (31/133 pre-PC vs. 96/238 post-PC; P =0.001). There were fewer admissions before IPC placement (18/103 vs. 43/133; P =0.01), and fewer thoracenteses per patient (2.7±2.5 in PC cohort vs. 4±5.1 in non-PC cohort; P <0.01). The frequency of pleurodesis was higher in the PC cohort (40/103 vs. 41/268; P <0.001). A Fine and Gray competing risks model indicated higher likelihood of pleurodesis in the PC cohort (adjusted subhazard ratio 3.8, 95% CI: 2.5-5.87). CONCLUSION: Our experience suggests that the implementation of a dedicated PC can lead to improved patient outcomes including fewer procedures and admissions before IPC placement, and increased rates of pleurodesis with IPC removal.",

      "content": "All patients who underwent IPC placement between January 2015 to January 2021 were included in this retrospective study. Data were collected by the electronic health record.\nFor each patient, the /uniFB01 rst IPC placement was captured and subsequent IPCs in the same patient were excluded from the analysis. This study was approved by the institutional review board of the study institution. Individual informed consent was waived.\nIPC placement was identi /uniFB01 ed by current procedural terminology (CPT) code 32550. MPE was de /uniFB01 ned as a malignant effusion proven by cytology or a paramalignant effusion associated with a documented active malignancy and negative pleural cytology, and ICD-10 coding. Pleurodesis was identi /uniFB01 ed with a documented catheter removal by current procedural terminology code 32552 and each patient with an IPC removal was independently reviewed by the authors (K.M. and Y.B.G) to exclude patients with catheter removal for alternative indications including infection, catheter malfunction or patient request. Emergency department (ED) visits and inpatient admissions for a respiratory related chief complaint 1 year before and 1 year after IPC placement were counted.\nIPCs (PleurX, CareFusion, San Diego, CA) were either placed and followed by an interventional pulmonologist through the PC (the ' PC cohort ' ) or placed and followed by other non-IP specialties ( ' non-PC cohort ' ) (Fig. 1). The PC was established in January 2018 and the pre-PC period is de /uniFB01 ned as dates between January 2015 and December 2017 where patients received IPCs with non-IP specialists and were not followed in the dedicated PC. For the non-PC cohort, patients were included for the entirety of the study period. The pre-PC patients were used as a subgroup of the non-PC cohort for comparison analyses, the ' pre-PC cohort. '\nAll patients in the PC cohort had scheduled IPC teaching by ambulatory staff within a few days of IPC placement. During this teaching, patients received an IPC educational packet with a video link, and a phone call from the clinic to address any questions or concerns. Patients were instructed to drain their IPC with a negative pressure canister per regimen outlined with the clinician, typically thrice weekly (range daily to weekly). Outpatient drainage was performed by patients themselves or caregivers after detailed instruction with a clinic nurse or with a visiting nurse if available. Templated written instructions were provided for each patient (Supplemental Figure 1, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http:// links.lww.com/LBR/A278), and publicly available patient information sheets. 30 A post-IPC placement visit protocol was instituted with initial follow up being 2 weeks after IPC placement for needs assessment and suture removal and an additional visit after 4 months to assess ongoing drainage requirements. Pleurodesis was assumed when pleural effusion drainage decreased to < 50 ml over 3 consecutive drainages. Catheter removal took place if minimal residual /uniFB02 uid was noted on thoracic ultrasound.\nFor patients in the non-PC cohort, there was no documentation of a standardized or protocolized regimen regarding follow up intervals, frequency of drainage or teaching, and management was at the discretion of the referring provider.",

Of these IPCs, 27.8% (103/371) were placed and managed through the PC and 72.2% (268/371) were placed by non-PC providers. Before the implementation of the PC in January 2018, 35.8% of the IPCs (133/371) had been placed by non-PC providers. Baseline demographics at the time of IPC placement are shown in Table 1. Malignancy was documented in 84.1% of patients (312/371) (Supplemental Table 1, Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/LBR/ A279). Pleural cytology was positive for malignant cells in 42.6% of patients (158/371)\nData are presented as mean ± SD or number (%).\nPC indicates Pleural clinic.\n(Supplemental Table 2, Supplemental Digital Content 3, http://links.lww.com/LBR/A280). IPCs were placed for nonmalignant effusions in 15.4% of patients (57/371).\nIPC placement occurred in the inpatient setting in 65.8% of patients (244/371) and in the outpatient setting in 34.2% of patients (127/371) (Table 2). The PC placed more IPCs on an outpatient basis than non-PC providers (67% [69/103] vs. 21.6% [58/268]; P < 0.001). There were fewer thoracenteses per patient before IPC placement in the PC group when compared with the non-PC group (2.7 ± 2.5 vs. 4 ± 5.1, respectively; P < 0.01). There was no difference in chest tube placement between the groups.\nSince the implementation of the PC in January 2018, there was an increase in the overall proportion of IPC placement in the ambulatory setting (23.3% [31/133] before the implementation of the PC vs. 40.3% [96/238] after the implementation of the PC; P = 0.001). There were also fewer thoracenteses per patient before IPC placement when the PC cohort was compared with the pre-PC cohort (2.7 ± 2.5 vs. 4.5 ± 6.1, respectively; P < 0.01; Table 2).\nBefore the IPC placement, 7.6% of patients (28/371) had an ED visit, and 2.7% (10/371) had an ED visit after placement (Table 3). Before the IPC placement, 23.7% of patients (88/371) had a respiratory related admission and 10.5% of patients (39/371) were admitted after IPC placement. There were no differences in ED visits or admissions between the PC and non-PC cohorts.\nAt the end of the follow up period (January 1, 2021), 21.8% of patients (81/371) had achieved pleurodesis and 60.9% (226/371) had died (Table 4). Of the 94, the patients that had their IPC removed, 81 had their catheter removed for suspected pleurodesis. Of the remaining 13 patients, 6 were removed for documented or suspected infection, 3 were removed for pain, 2 were removed for frequent clotting, 1 was a temporary intra-op placement, and 1 was removed for patient safety related issues. Eight of the patients who achieved pleurodesis had talc poudrage during thoracoscopy, 5 of these in the PC cohort and 3 in the non-PC cohort. No patients received talc slurry.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest dataset analyzing a subset of patients followed in an IP dedicated PC with protocolized patient education and follow up.\nIn this cohort, there was a shift to ambulatory IPC placement after the implementation of the PC. In Addition, patients treated through the PC had fewer admissions before IPC placement compared with the pre-PC group. These /uniFB01 ndings are similar to that reported by Enríquez and colleagues, 32 who found that after the implementation of a pleural unit there was an increase in the number of procedures being done on an outpatient basis. 32 They also noted a decrease in readmissions for MPE from 9.3% to 2.9%, and a decrease in admission rates and length of stay for other pleural diseases, demonstrating a role for specialist pleural care. 32 Putnam and colleagues 21 described a reduction in hospitalizations, shorter duration of admissions (by as many as 7 d) and improved quality of life (QOL) when IPCs are placed on an outpatient basis. By shifting procedures to an elective ambulatory setting, patients avoid unnecessary hospital admissions. In Addition, ambulatory management of pleural effusions may reduce health care costs, as the cost for inpatient management of pleural effusions is up to 7.2 times higher than outpatient management. 33\nAligning with guidelines, patients treated through the PC underwent fewer thoracenteses before IPC placement compared with the non-PC cohort. 29 Early IPC placement with fewer thoracenteses has been associated with reduced hospital length of stay and admission rates. 20,34 Serial thoracentesis may predispose patients to procedure related risks and pleural space organization. Ost and colleagues 35 quantitatively described this when they noted the strategy of repeat thoracentesis was associated with increased future procedures, complications, and ED visits in MPE when compared with early IPC placement. Furthermore, IPC related relief of symptoms is sustained and may enhance QOL when compared with the intermittent recurrence of dyspnea with interval thoracenteses. In NMPE, the REDUCE study found no differences in initial breathlessness for patients with refractory transudative effusions treated with serial thoracentesis versus IPC. 36 In a separate\npatient cohort of recurrent NMPE, serial thoracenteses lead to longer mean hospital stays (17.39 vs. 8.36 d) and an increased frequency of admissions when compared with the IPC group. 34 Taken together, these data support early discussion of IPC placement for patients with either NMPE or MPE related symptomatic refractory effusions.\nThe overall pleurodesis rate of 21.8% in our cohort is lower than that reported in the literature, with signi /uniFB01 cantly higher rates of pleurodesis in our PC cohort (38.8%). 19 Muruganandan et al 27 and Wahidi et al 28 reported pleurodesis rates of 44% and 47%, respectively, when daily drainage regimens were used. Patients in the PC cohort were not routinely recommended to perform daily drainages and their drainage regimen was based on discussion with the patient. Typically, drainage regimens were initiated at thrice weekly and re-visited on follow up based on patient input. Detailed drainage regimens and instructions were documented in the chart and provided to the patient with additional educational material. In comparison, IPC drainage instructions for the non-PC cohort were inconsistently documented and management of the IPC was left to the referring provider. We suspect that the difference in pleurodesis rates between the PC and non-PC cohorts stems from several factors including early intervention before the development of nonreexpandable lung, and from clear management regimens communicated and taught to the patient. On average, time to pleurodesis was longer in all groups than that reported by the prior studies. Pleurodesis is a favorable side effect of IPC as the removal of the catheter liberates patients from the associated maintenance, infection risks, and costs. 37\nMedian survival after IPC placement was 2.7 months in the PC cohort and 1.1 months in the non-PC cohort. These survival estimates are within the 1-to-13-month range reported for MPE, with a 1-year mortality for NMPE between 53% and -57%. 7,9 -13 The difference in survival between the 2 cohorts may re /uniFB02 ect earlier placement of IPC in the disease course for those treated by the PC clinic. It may also re /uniFB02 ect any additional survival bene /uniFB01 t obtained through early palliation of symptoms, as early utilization of palliative measures has been shown to improve QOL and even survival. 38\nOur /uniFB01 ndings suggest that protocolized drainage regimens with scheduled follow up in a dedicated PC may confer bene /uniFB01 t through\ndecreased thoracenteses and increased rates of pleurodesis. Our post-IPC placement protocol includes an initial 2 week follow up visit to examine the insertion site and address postplacement issues. The 4-month visit assesses ongoing drainage needs. In review of the literature, scheduled follow up has varied. The AMPLE-1 study maintained follow up visits at 10 to 14 days, every 2 weeks for visits 2 to 4 and then every 4 weeks for visits 5 to 8. 26 The AMPLE-2 trial had follow-up at weeks 2 and 4 week, and thereafter monthly for 6 months by an unspeci /uniFB01 ed clinic. 28 Overall, guidelines regarding postinsertion management are scarce and cite the paucity of data. In 2018, American Thoracic Society published weak recommendations regarding IPC placement for MPEs based on the available evidence and did not address postinsertion management. 29 In Addition, the American Association for Bronchoscopy and Interventional Pulmonology and The American Academy of Chest Physicians concluded that there was insuf /uniFB01 cient evidence based on the existing data to make recommendations regarding IPC postinsertion management. 2,25 This study provides real world data outside of the context of a clinical trial and supports the role of standardized post-IPC management and follow up.\nThis study has several limitations stemming from its single center, retrospective, and nonrandomized design. The cohorts did not differ signi /uniFB01 cantly by demographic factors though there is a possibility of unmeasured variables that may confound the relationship between PC and nonPC patient cohorts. Biases related to the increased frequency of IPCs placed in the inpatient setting by the non-PC cohort were unable to be accounted for. The single center nature of this study and center-speci /uniFB01 c practice patterns may limit generalizability to other populations. Given the single center nature, we were unable to include any outside hospital variables such as catheter removal at other sites or pleurodesis if not achieved locally, which may underestimate true rates of pleurodesis for both arms of this cohort. The relatively small number of events in each group may limit the ability to achieve statistical signi /uniFB01 cance. In Addition, the teaching in the PC may lack interprovider standardization and patient ability to follow instructions (such as frequency of drainage) may vary and was not controlled for.\nDespite the limitations, this study has several strengths. We studied a relatively large cohort of\npatients with both MPE and NMPE managed with IPC. Our study was designed as a comparative analysis utilizing a speci /uniFB01 c point in time when a dedicated PC was implemented. This allowed for a comparison of IPC related outcomes in the pre-PC and post-PC implementation periods of time. We demonstrated that the implementation of a dedicated PC run by IP providers can reduce admissions and achieve more frequent pleurodesis with IPC removal and thereby reduce IPC related burden to the patients while potentially providing a cost savings bene /uniFB01 t.\nIn conclusion, this study provides a large single center retrospective analysis of pleural effusions managed with IPCs followed in a dedicated specialist PC. The data suggest that early involvement of dedicated specialists and routine follow up in a pleural clinic has a positive impact on pleural related outcomes, including lower rates of admissions with earlier IPC placement and higher rates of pleurodesis with catheter removal. Additional research is warranted on optimal post-IPC placement management.",
