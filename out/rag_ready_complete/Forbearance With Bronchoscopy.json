    "abstract": "FB is a relatively safe procedure, yet like other invasive procedures, the ability to perform should not translate into the necessity to perform. It can be considered in clinical scenarios in which a high diagnostic yield is anticipated. Alternative modalities of investigation should be sought when the pretest probability of diagnostic yield from bronchoscopy is low. The operator should be well versed with indications, contraindications, diagnostic yield alternatives, and the relative cost of the procedure. Vascular endothelial growth factor D is a biomarker that is emerging as a promising diagnostic tool for lymphangioleiomyomatosis, a destructive lung disease. 100,101 Several biomarkers are currently under study to detect various types of rejection in patients with lung transplants. Cylex Immune Cell Function Assay (ImmuKnow; Cylex, Inc) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration and is being studied for use in lung transplant rejections. 102 The utility of these biomarkers as a /uniFB01 rst-line investigation will increase exponentially for better classifying phenotypes and diagnosing several diseases, such as lymphangioleiomyomatosis and acute rejection in lung transplant.

Mehta, MD, FCCP\nAdvanced technologies such as endobronchial ultrasound and electromagnetic navigation have revolutionized the /uniFB01 eld of bronchoscopy. Its indications as a diagnostic as well as a therapeutic tool continue to expand at a rapid pace. This growth also has led to the emergence of a new subspecialty of interventional pulmonology and more than 40 fellowship training programs. However, with increasing popularity and accessibility, there is a high impetus for performing the procedure when it may be of limited value. On the basis of a literature review and our own experience, we produced a list of conditions for which bronchoscopy is of limited value yet is being performed frequently. Conditions such as idiopathic pulmonary /uniFB01 brosis, massive hemoptysis, cystic /uniFB01 brosis, smear-negative pulmonary TB, and stage I sarcoidosis may be approached best in a more prudent fashion, with the bronchoscopic approach reserved for exceptional cases. We present an overview of conditions for which the expectations for bronchoscopy exceed the evidence in the literature, and we coined the term ' forbearance with bronchoscopy ' for situations in which this popular tool may not be the most appropriate initial approach.

It can be useful in the diagnosis of malignancy (lung or metastatic), infections (TB, nontubercular Mycobacterium , fungal, Cytomegalovirus , Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia), rejection in recipients of lung\ntransplants, in /uniFB01 ltrates in patients who are immunocompromised, and certain diffuse lung diseases (sarcoidosis, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, eosinophilic pneumonia, berylliosis, amyloidosis, pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia, and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia). 3\nThe /uniFB01 eld of bronchoscopy has been revolutionized further by the introduction of\nABBREVIATIONS: CD = cluster of differentiation; CF = cystic /uniFB01 brosis; Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) = endobronchial ultrasound; FB = /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopy; FM = /uniFB01 brosing mediastinitis; HRCT = high-resolution CT; IPF = idiopathic pulmonary /uniFB01 brosis; MDCT = multidetector CT; PN = pulmonary nodule; SN-PTB = smear-negative pulmonary TB; TBBx = transbronchial biopsy; TBNA = transbronchial needle aspiration; TTNA = transthoracic needle aspiration\nAFFILIATIONS: From the Medicine Institute (Dr Deshwal), the Respiratory Institute (Drs Avasarala and Mehta), and Diagnostic Radiology (Dr Ghosh), Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.\nCORRESPONDENCE TO: Atul C.

Mucous plugging, bronchiectasis, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and recurrent lower respiratory tract infections are its common manifestations (Fig 1). Studies have\nrecommended a bronchoscopic evaluation to guide antimicrobial therapy during CF exacerbations, and there is some evidence to support this practice. 7 However, less invasive means such as sputum or throat swab cultures also can predict lung colonization with Pseudomonas aeroginosa with reasonable accuracy. Aaron et al 8 found that induced sputum was as good as BAL and reserved brushing to characterize genotype and antibiotic susceptibility in chronic P aeruginosa infection in patients with CF.\nMediastinal lymphadenopathy occurs in at least 52% of patients with CF because of chronic in /uniFB02 ammation and is usually progressive, correlating with the severity of the pulmonary disease. 9 CT scanning of the chest is a reasonable tool to follow up interval development with no role for bronchoscopy unless suspicion for malignancy or lymphoma is high.\nBronchoscopy also is performed frequently for the management of hemoptysis in patients with CF. Guidelines on massive hemoptysis state that bronchoscopy is of little value in source localization and time management in this group of patients. 10 However, bronchoscopy can be useful in patients with CF with lobar collapse because dornase alfa can be instilled precisely into the involved bronchopulmonary segment to improve outcomes. 11,12",

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation and lymphadenopathy\nhaving SN-PTB is recommended prior to performing bronchoscopy.\nThe Mycobacterium tuberculosis nucleic acid ampli /uniFB01 cation test has a 95% sensitivity and a 98% positive predictive value in diagnosing TB in patients suspected of having TB. 23 It can reduce the time from specimen collection to treatment (3 vs 14 days, P < .0001). 24 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends carrying out nucleic acid ampli /uniFB01 cation testing in at least one respiratory sample along with an acid-fast bacilli smear to improve diagnostic capabilities. 25\nThe Xpert MTB/RIF ( M tuberculosis DNA and resistance to rifampicin) assay is another highly\nsensitive and speci /uniFB01 c test that can detect Mtuberculosis within 2 hours, making it a good point-of-care testing method. In addition, it has the capability of detecting rifampin (the /uniFB01 rst-line drug for TB treatment) resistance in respiratory samples. 26 Chakravorty et al 27 developed an Xpert MTB/RIF Ultra assay that has an increased sensitivity and speci /uniFB01 city to detect M tuberculosis in smear-negative pulmonary samples as well, making it even more accurate. With the increasing utility of these rapid tests, quick and costeffective decisions to initiate treatment can be made, further bypassing the need for diagnostic bronchoscopy, given that these tests can be performed on respiratory samples from both sputum and BAL with accurate results.\n[\n]\nLocal anesthesia such as lidocaine can inhibit the growth of M tuberculosis organisms. 17,28 A concentration as low as 1 mL of 2% lidocaine is enough to inhibit the growth of Mycobacterium . 28 Because administration is operator dependent, an excess of lidocaine may be used during bronchoscopy that could inhibit the organism and lead to a lower yield for bronchoscopy and TBBx. In addition, studies have demonstrated puri /uniFB01 ed protein derivative conversion of up to 11% in pulmonary medicine trainees working in the bronchoscopy unit, suggesting a potential risk of TB transmission to health-care providers in bronchoscopy suites. 29\nIn the endemic parts of the world, if the induced sputum specimen remains negative but clinical and imaging suspicion of TB remains high, a trial of anti-TB therapy may be appropriate. The role of bronchoscopy should be limited to patients with consistently negative sputum smears, those not responding to therapy, or those in whom there is a higher suspicion for an alternate diagnosis. 30",

      "content": "The role of rigid bronchoscopy in the management of massive hemoptysis is well established; however, that of either rigid bronchoscopy or FB in diagnosing the source or the cause of mild to moderate hemoptysis is still debatable. The yield of FB in identifying the cause of hemoptysis of any severity with a negative radiograph or CT scan of the chest is only 16% to 21%. 31,32\nIn the experience of Hsiao et al 33 with 28 patients with massive hemoptysis localized by means of radiography, bronchoscopy was able to identify the source in 23 patients (82.1%). However, when the radiograph was nonlocalizing, bronchoscopy was able to identify the site in only three patients (10.7%), all of whom had bronchiectasis and none of whom had undergone CT scanning to identify the site. 33\nMultidetector CT (MDCT) scanning has an overall higher sensitivity in localizing the site of hemoptysis than does FB. 34 It can identify the source of hemoptysis in 63% to 100% of patients and is notably superior to bronchoscopy in cases of bronchiectasis, pulmonary infections, and lung cancer. 34 It also has the advantage of visualizing distal airways that may be obscured by bleeding and a sensitivity of 90% in detecting endobronchial lesions (Fig 2). 34\nPoe et al 35 identi /uniFB01 ed that the presence of two of three risk factors for malignancy (Table 3) or hemoptysis of\nmore than 30 mL identi /uniFB01 ed 100% of cases with bronchogenic carcinoma identi /uniFB01 ed with bronchoscopy. This /uniFB01 nding suggests that using risk strati /uniFB01 cation can prevent unnecessary procedures by 28%. 35 Hirshberg et al 36 also found that bronchoscopy was more effective in locating the bleeding site in moderate (64%) and severe (67%) hemoptysis than in mild (49%) hemoptysis. Consequently, the combined use of MDCT scanning and bronchoscopy may increase accuracy in detecting the source of bleeding (93%) compared with CT scanning alone (67%). 36 Nielsen et al 37 found that sensitivity in localizing the source of hemoptysis in patients with lung cancer with\nHigh yield of bronchoscopy in hemoptysis if any 2 of the 3 risk factors are present 35\n1.

It should be performed only if MDCT scanning results are unrevealing. Once the source is con /uniFB01 rmed, then therapeutic procedures such as the application of cold saline or local vasoconstrictors, balloon tamponade, electrocautery, laser ablation, or stent placement can be considered.",

Its management includes addressing the cause and noninvasive methods such as chest physiotherapy, mechanical percussion therapy, positive end-expiratory pressure support, dornase alfa instillation, and bronchodilators.\nThe utility of FB as a diagnostic or therapeutic tool for atelectasis in patients receiving mechanical ventilation long has been debated. Radiographic resolution and improvements in oxygenation and static lung compliance can be seen following bronchoscopy.\nBronchoscopy commonly is used to treat atelectasis, most often in the critical care setting. Bronchoscopy is not the cornerstone of therapy for atelectasis; aggressive noninvasive chest physiotherapy can be equally ef /uniFB01 cacious. 38,39 Prognostically, an air bronchogram portends a delayed response to any therapy for atelectasis. 38,39 Marini et al 38 conducted a randomized study comparing bronchoscopy and noninvasive respiratory therapy among patients with atelectasis receiving mechanical ventilation. Thirty-one subjects were placed into one of two groups, with one group receiving bronchoscopy followed by respiratory therapy and the other group receiving respiratory therapy alone. No difference was observed in the restoration of volume loss between the two groups within /uniFB01 rst 24 and 48 hours ( P > .20). 38 Raoof et al 39 also showed that combined kinetic and percussion therapy was a superior modality to conventional treatments and that it obviated the need\n[\n]\nfor bronchoscopy in 68% of patients (Fig 3).

Diagnosis is con /uniFB01 rmed mainly via CT scanning of the chest. Findings of mediastinal soft-tissue mass, calci /uniFB01 cation and evidence of collateral vessels from chronic obstruction, peribronchial cuf /uniFB01 ng, and interlobular septal thickening obviate the need for biopsy (Fig 4).\nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) often is attempted for diagnostic purposes; however, these specimens mostly reveal noncon /uniFB01 rmatory /uniFB01 ndings of in /uniFB02 ammation and /uniFB01 brosis without organisms. 42 Bronchoscopy also often is used for therapeutic purposes in FM. Airway stent placement and mesh repair have been conducted using a /uniFB02 exible bronchoscope, and it may result temporarily in clinical improvement. However, FM is a metabolically active disease, and self-expanding metallic stents frequently reocclude due to granuloma formation. 43 Destruction of anatomic planes further makes such interventions ineffective, with higher rates of complications such as\nbleeding due to concomitant collateral vessels and engorgement. 44 The utility of silicone stents in FM also is limited due to a higher incidence of stent migration. 45 Bronchoscopy can be considered cautiously in cases of severe symptomatic disease. However, the operator must be aware of the substantial risk of hemorrhage and should be prepared for it. Spray cryotherapy is a form of noncontact cryotherapy being used for hemoptysis in FM, with a lower rate of recurrent hemoptysis. 46",

A variety of prediction models commonly are used to estimate the risk of a PN ' s malignancy: Mayo, Brock, Herder, and Veterans Affairs. They all have been validated externally and have some commonalities regarding risk factors for malignancy: older age, current smoking or history of smoking, larger nodule, and history of lung or extrathoracic malignancy. 47\nBiopsy commonly is performed in PNs to establish a diagnosis; however, not all nodules need to be sampled. Besides, there are many sampling modalities to choose from, and the selection depends on the interaction of multiple factors: patient, operator, and institutional speci /uniFB01 cs. There a variety of bronchoscopic approaches. It is essential to remember that the decision to use a speci /uniFB01 c diagnostic modality is made on a case-by-case basis. A limited summary of the bronchoscopic modalities, their overall diagnostic accuracy, and factors that may increase diagnostic yield is presented in Table 4. 48-51\nFB often is used to obtain tissue samples from a PN. However, Zhang et al 52 found that the accuracy of\nconventional bronchoscopy in the preoperative workup for PNs was only 24.3%, with a negative predictive value of only 20.5%. This /uniFB01 nding suggests that conventional bronchoscopy should be used carefully in the evaluation of peripheral nodules in the age of high-value and costeffective care.\nThe advent of newer technologies, including radial probe Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), virtual bronchoscopy, and electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy, has resulted in increased use of bronchoscopy in the evaluation of PN. Some studies have shown that the procedure guided by these tools has a higher diagnostic yield for PNs. 53-55 A meta-analysis found the pooled diagnostic yield to be 70%. 48 However, most studies looking at electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy were uncontrolled, and further randomized trials are needed.\nDespite the advancement in bronchoscopy, its diagnostic yield remains inferior to that of transthoracic needle aspiration (TTNA). A metaanalysis of 48 studies showed a pooled diagnostic accuracy of 92.1% for CT scanning-guided TTNA and 88.7% for ultrasound-guided TTNA. 56 TTNA remains the diagnostic modality of choice for small peripheral lesions if the patient can sustain the risk of pneumothorax. If the tools for guided bronchoscopy are unavailable, FB should be reserved for large ( > 2 cm in diameter), centrally located lesions that\nhave a positive bronchus sign and for which the certainty of the yield would justify the procedure.",

At HRCT scanning, IPF is diagnosed by exclusion of other diseases and typical /uniFB01 ndings of usual interstitial pneumonia. According to revised American Thoracic Society, European Respiratory Society, Japanese Respiratory Society, and Latin American Thoracic Association guidelines, lung biopsy is not required in patients with no environmental exposure, connective tissue disease, or drug toxicities and de /uniFB01 nite usual interstitial pneumonia diagnosed on the basis of HRCT scanning /uniFB01 ndings. 61-63 In this regard, the value of TBBx performed via FB is limited. To our knowledge, the role of cryobiopsy in establishing the diagnosis of IPF still remains to be studied. BAL also may be performed to help differentiate IPF from other /uniFB01 brotic lung diseases (sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, nonspeci /uniFB01 c interstitial pneumonitis, and interstitial lung disease related to connective tissue disease). BAL demonstrating lymphocytosis ( > 30%) is postulated to suggest a non-IPF diagnosis in a patient with radiographically visible /uniFB01 brotic lung\ndisease. 64 The clinical utility of this /uniFB01 nding is still under debate. 64,65\nIn patients with IPF, bronchoscopy often is performed to assess mediastinal lymphadenopathy, which is a common /uniFB01 nding seen in approximately 60% of cases. 66 The size and the number of enlarged lymph nodes directly correlate with the severity of the IPF. 67 This lymphadenopathy is usually a sequela of chronic in /uniFB02 ammation and not a concurrent infection or neoplasm. Bronchoscopy should be avoided under such circumstances unless there is a high suspicion of malignancy (Fig 5).\nBronchoscopy also is performed in patients with IPF presenting with acute respiratory failure. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, infections, and acute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease are the common causes of such a presentation. Bronchoscopy is of low diagnostic yield in assessing the cause of respiratory failure under such circumstances. Bronchoscopy is of any therapeutic impact in < 25% of patients, and there is no mortality difference between those with and those without positive /uniFB01 ndings at bronchoscopy. 68 Besides, the procedure is associated with high rate of complications (25%). 68 BAL also leads to increased risk in patients with acute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease. 69 FB might be\nof diagnostic value in patients who are receiving immunosuppressive regimens or who have clinical concerns about diffuse alveolar hemorrhage; however, meticulous patient selection is essential. 70",

      "content": "Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disorder that commonly manifests as bilateral hilar adenopathy and pulmonary reticular opacities. More than one-half of all patients with active disease receive the diagnosis at stage I when spontaneous resolution is common.\nA tissue diagnosis is not necessary for most patients with stage I sarcoidosis. 71 The risk of missing a more sinister diagnosis such as lymphoma is a common counterargument in favor of tissue sampling. Several studies have proven that the lack of symptoms and clinical /uniFB01 ndings have a strong negative predictive value against a malignant process in patients with radiographic evidence of bilateral hilar adenopathy. 72 Statistical models that account for the incidence of sarcoidosis estimate that the likelihood of /uniFB01 nding an alternative diagnosis via invasive biopsy in a patient with stage I sarcoidosis is 5 in 10,000 (Fig 6). 73\nBAL often is performed to differentiate between sarcoidosis and hypersensitivity pneumonitis, favoring performance of FB. The most frequently assessed\nparameters in this scenario are the cell counts and proportions of lymphocyte subpopulations; a high ratio of cluster of differentiation (CD)4 to CD8 point toward sarcoidosis. In a study of 562 patients who underwent BAL for the evaluation of interstitial lung disease, both IPF and sarcoidosis had ratios of CD4 to CD8 > 1.0. 74 In another study, the lymphocyte subset ratio was assessed in patients with clinical and histologic evidence of sarcoidosis. The ratio of CD4 to CD8 of < 1 was found in less than 12% of patients. 75 However, the diagnostic value of the BAL lymphocyte subset ratio also is modi /uniFB01 ed by the radiographic stage of sarcoidosis and the patient ' s smoking status. In summary, BAL with an elevated ratio of CD4 to CD8 should be used in context with the clinicoradiologic picture and should not form the sole basis for diagnosing sarcoidosis.\nAlthough many centers rely on TBNA for diagnosing sarcoidosis, the data behind its use must be analyzed carefully. Early Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA studies used a patient population that was rich with sarcoidosis. More than 90% of patients in these studies received a /uniFB01 nal diagnosis of sarcoidosis. 76 A majority of sarcoidosis studies also originated from tertiary medical centers /uniFB02 ush with highly skilled operators and experienced pathologists. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA performed in a less experienced center yielded a nondiagnostic rate of 73%. 77 Also, most EBUSTBNA studies have never de /uniFB01 ned the entry criteria for patient selection, thereby limiting the generalizability of the results.\nThe presence of a noncaseating granuloma is an essential piece of information used to diagnose sarcoidosis. However, it is not an all-or-nothing /uniFB01 nding. Although conventional and advanced bronchoscopic methods are available for sampling purposes, the priority should be pursuing the least invasive approach. In patients who may have stage I sarcoidosis, this may be as simple as taking a careful history and performing a thorough physical examination. In summary, the clinical acumen of the operator is paramount in estimating any potential bene /uniFB01 t of bronchoscopy in this patient population.",

' To our\n[\n]\nknowledge, it was /uniFB01 rst reported in the literature in 1998 and can be found in 54% to 68% of patients with congestive heart failure. 80,81 Congestive lymphadenopathy is common in patients with acute uncompensated congestive heart failure without diastolic dysfunction and in patients with coronary artery disease without heart failure. 82 It is a maker of volume overload, not of systolic dysfunction. Occasionally, mediastinal lymphadenopathy is found among patients with uncorrected congenital heart disease. Similarly, up to 18% of patients with PAH can have mediastinal lymphadenopathy. 83 This adenopathy often resolves with appropriate treatment. Keeping in mind the clinical context and nonmalignant nature of mediastinal lymphadenopathy, an attempt to obtain tissue in such cases would be of low diagnostic value. If there is a doubt, repeat chest CT scanning should be performed to assess for regression in the size of the lymph nodes once the patient has been deemed euvolemic (Fig 7).",

      "content": "Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is a common manifestation of all types of lymphoma. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA is a valuable tool to identify several causes of mediastinal lymphadenopathy. However, its role in diagnosing lymphoma, particularly Hodgkin lymphoma, remains controversial. 86 Small sample size limits con /uniFB01 rmation of lymph node architecture, Reed-Sternberg cells, extent of sclerosis, and extent of any granulomatous component, all of which are essential to con /uniFB01 rm and plan the therapy for the condition. This dif /uniFB01 culty may lead to a high discordance between the cytologic /uniFB01 ndings at EBUSTBNA and histopathologic data obtained by more\ninvasive means. In other words, among patients with a high likelihood of having Hodgkin disease, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA may not be the ideal diagnostic test.\nSeveral studies have shown high sensitivity and speci /uniFB01 city of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for lymphomas. 87 However, most of the results have been for recurrent disease or in cases of non-Hodgkin lymphomas and ultimately required con /uniFB01 rmation with mediastinoscopy or surgical biopsy. 88 Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA has a sensitivity of only 61% to 78% for newly diagnosed non-Hodgkin lymphoma. 89,90\nImmunohistochemical and /uniFB02 ow cytometric assessment of TBBx specimens is important because these assessments determine the type of treatment required for patients with lymphoma. Patients suspected of having lymphoma for the /uniFB01 rst time ultimately require surgical biopsy to characterize the type of lymphoma further. In addition, the yield of TBBx in diagnosing lymphoma may differ signi /uniFB01 cantly in different studies because of the availability of rapid on-site microscopic examination, which may not be available at all institutions. 91 The\nutility of 19-guage needle signi /uniFB01 cantly increases the yield in lung malignancy but still falls short for diagnosing Hodgkin lymphoma because subsequent mediastinoscopy is required for further subtyping. 92 Studies also have demonstrated increased blood contamination of the sample with larger needles. 93 Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA could be reserved for recurrent lymphomas or in selected cases of high suspicion for non-Hodgkin lymphomas. 94",

Performing an invasive procedure without suspicion for an alternate diagnosis can be detrimental. There is increased risk of hypoxemia with bronchoscopy in patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and pulmonary hypertension. Towe et al 96 found that BAL in patients with severe Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with increased risk of pneumothorax, bleeding, respiratory failure, and pneumonia (Odds ratio (OR), 6.49; 95% CI, 1.68-24.3; P < .006). BAL may cause airway obstruction and disequilibration of the pressure of intraalveolar gases and, as a result, leakage into the pleural cavity, leading to pneumothorax. 97 Studies have shown that clinical presentation with selfreported sputum purulence and multiple exacerbations ( > 4 in a year) and severe airway obstruction correlates well with distal airway bacterial infection. 98 There is no indication for bronchoscopy to document lower respiratory tract infection among patients presenting with acute exacerbation of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).",

It can be considered in clinical scenarios in which a high diagnostic yield is anticipated. Alternative modalities of investigation should be sought when the pretest probability of diagnostic yield from bronchoscopy is low. The operator should be well versed with indications, contraindications, diagnostic yield alternatives, and the relative cost of the procedure. Vascular endothelial growth factor D is a biomarker that is emerging as a promising diagnostic tool for lymphangioleiomyomatosis, a destructive lung disease. 100,101 Several biomarkers are currently under study to detect various types of rejection in patients with lung transplants. Cylex Immune Cell Function Assay (ImmuKnow; Cylex, Inc) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration and is being studied for use in lung transplant rejections. 102\nThe utility of these biomarkers as a /uniFB01 rst-line investigation will increase exponentially for better classifying phenotypes and diagnosing several diseases, such as lymphangioleiomyomatosis and acute rejection in lung transplant. However, bronchoscopy and TBBx remain standard practice because of their high yield.",
