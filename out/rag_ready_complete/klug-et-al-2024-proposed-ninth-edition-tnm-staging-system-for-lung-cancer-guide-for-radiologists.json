      "content": "Lung  cancer  is  the  leading  cause  of  cancer-related  deaths worldwide, accounting for the highest mortality rates among both men and women (1). How disease in patients with newly diagnosed lung cancer is treated depends on staging. Stage classifi.ligacation  is  the  cornerstone  to  optimize  patient  stratifi.ligacation  and  predict  survival.  However, it is only one of the prognostic  factors  considered  when  selecting  a  therapeutic approach. Other factors such as performance status, medical comorbidities, tumor histologic features, and molecular analysis also aff.ligaect prognosis and determine therapy. By stratify-\ning patients into similar universal groups, stage classifi.ligacation provides  a  consistent  description  of  the  anatomic  extent  of the tumor in a patient cohort, which allows comparison of one treatment to another. Stage classifi.ligacation relies on an agreedon nomenclature of the anatomic extent of the cancer. Clear and consistent communication is vital for selecting a treatment strategy, especially in multidisciplinary discussions, in alignment with clinical  trial  data  to  predict  outcomes  a/f_t.ligaer treatment (2).\nThe staging system describes the extent of the primary tumor as T, regional lymph node involvement as N, and distant\nCancer Control and the American Joint Committee on Cancer. Although IASLC's ninth edition database has a similar number of evaluable lung cancer cases as the seventh and eighth editions  (TNM-7  and  TNM-8),  with  more  than  100 000  patients  (4),  the  collected  data  have  much  greater  granularity to address the limitations of TNM-8, which include the lack of quantifi.ligacation  of  nodal  metastatic burden, lack of granularity within the M1c category, and exclusion of patients who have  undergone  neoadjuvant  therapy  from  staging  evaluation (5). Neoadjuvant refers to treatment given as a fi.ligarst step to shrink the tumor before the main treatment, usually surgery. In terms of the staging assessments, the prefi.ligax 'y' indicates restaging and pertains to patients who have received neoadjuvant therapy. Analysis of this new database showed signifi.ligacant  diff.ligaerences  in  survival  between  patients  within subgroups of the N2 and M1c categories and a worse prognosis for patients with ypN disease (pathologic N a/f_t.ligaer neoadjuvant therapy) than for those with pN (pathologic N without neoadjuvant therapy) disease (6). General recommendations for modifi.ligacation of these descriptors and overall stage groups have been published (3), with more supporting literature yet to be published. The aim of this article is to review the proposals for TNM-9 staging for lung cancer with an emphasis on clinical staging as it pertains to imaging interpretation.",

      "content": "The  T  descriptor  delineates  distinct  attributes  of  the  primary  neoplasm,  encompassing  factors  such  as  tumor  measurements and the extent of local invasion (Table 1). Because TNM-8 introduced profound changes to the T descriptor, the goal of the analysis of TNM-9 revisions was to validate the T descriptors  of  TNM-8  and  assess  whether  further  changes were necessary. Analysis from the new database supported no change for T descriptors from TNM-8 (7). Because a major part of T staging relies on tumor size, and each 1-cm increment from 1 cm to 5 cm worsens the prognosis, care should be taken to optimize the acquisition of CT images and to perform accurate tumor measurements. For CT evaluation of the T descriptor, lung window settings with a sharp fi.ligalter are used and images should be contiguous with a section thickness of 1 mm or less (8).  This  decreases  partial  averaging  and  facilitates  accurate measurements and characterization of nodule type, whether solid,  part-solid,  or  pure  ground  glass.  For  staging  purposes, the long-axis diameter of the solid primary tumor is recorded, whether in the axial, sagittal, or coronal planes. For staging of the part-solid primary tumor, the clinical T descriptor is determined by the longest diameter of the solid component because it correlates better with the invasive component of the tumor at pathologic evaluation. In addition, recording the overall diameter (including the ground-glass component) will enable future evaluation to assess if this parameter aff.ligaects prognosis (8).\nT1 tumors are 3 cm or less in greatest dimension, surrounded by lung or visceral pleura, without bronchoscopic evidence of  invasion  more  proximal  than  the  lobar  bronchus  (ie,  not in  the  main  bronchus). T1 tumors are categorized into three subgroups based on 1-cm increments: T1a nodules are 1 cm or smaller, T1b tumors measure more than 1 cm but less than or equal to 2 cm, and T1c lesions measure more than 2 cm but less",

The  system  should  be  consistently  applied to both clinical staging and pathologic staging. Clinical staging, designated by the prefi.ligax 'c' (c-stage or cTNM), involves all  available information that refl.ligaects the anatomic extent of a tumor before the initiation of treatment. Clinical staging relies heavily on imaging, but it is not limited to imaging studies. Other data in clinical staging include patients' symptoms and results of physical examination, endoscopy, biopsies, and surgical exploration. Because imaging is the main component of  clinical  staging,  familiarity  with  the  nuances  and  clinical implications of the updates in staging is essential to provide detailed yet succinct eff.ligaective interpretations.

The uncommon superfi.ligacial spreading tumor of any size with its invasive component limited to the bronchial wall, which may extend proximal to the main bronchus, is also classifi.ligaed as T1a (9). Carcinoma in situ, a histologic descriptor, is classifi.ligaed as Tis, which applies to both squamous carcinoma (Tis[SCIS]) and adenocarcinoma (Tis[AIS]). Tis usually appears at CT as pure ground-glass opacity measuring 3 cm or less (8). Minimally invasive adenocarcinomas are designated as T1 (mi) if the invasive component is 5 mm or less and the noninvasive lepidic component is 3 cm or less (10). At CT,\nT1 (mi) tumors typically appear as part-solid nodules with a total size of 3 cm or less and a solid component of 5 mm or less, but minimally invasive adenocarcinomas may be found histologically in pure ground-glass nodules and even, in rare cases, in solid nodules (8). Although the solid component observed on CT scans correlates with the invasive nature of minimally invasive  adenocarcinoma,  CT  should  not  be  viewed  as  a  replacement for histologic evaluation for the invasive component during  pathologic  examination,  because  pure  ground-glass nodules are sometimes found to be fully invasive (11).\nT2 tumors are categorized into two subgroups: T2a tumors, which measure more than 3 cm but less than or equal to 4 cm, and T2b lesions, which measure more than 4 cm but less than or equal to 5 cm (Fig 2). The size of the lesion is determined by the longest diameter, and nonmeasurable lesions are classifi.ligaed as T2a. T2 descriptors include involvement of the main bronchus without involving  the  carina,  invasion  of  the  visceral  pleura,  and  association  with  atelectasis  or  obstructive pneumonitis extending to the hilum (9).\nT3 tumors measure more than 5 cm but are less than or equal to 7 cm. T3 may also be used to describe tumors of any size  that  exhibit  specifi.ligac  anatomic  features  such  as  involvement of the chest wall,  pericardium,  phrenic  nerve,  or  satellite tumor nodules within the same lobe as that of the primary tumor (Fig 3). Within the T3 descriptors, patients with a pathologic T3 descriptor (pT3) due to chest wall and/or parietal pleural invasion have worse overall survival than patients with pT3 due to tumor size or separate lung nodules. However, this diff.ligaerence in survival was not present for patients with clinically staged disease. Because of the inconsistency, it was decided that there was insuffi.ligacient evidence to change the chest wall portion of the T3 descriptor. The discrepancy between  the  clinical  and  pathologic  staging  of  the  parietal pleura and chest wall invasion was thought to be due to the low sensitivity of CT for identifying parietal pleural involvement and sometimes even chest wall involvement (7).\nT4 tumors measure more than 7 cm or display specifi.ligac anatomic characteristics such as invasion of the diaphragm, mediastinum, heart, great vessels, trachea, carina, recurrent laryngeal nerve, esophagus, vertebral body, or brachial plexus (superior branches C8 or above). Additional tumor nodules in the ipsilateral lung but in a diff.ligaerent lobe than that of the\nprimary tumor are also a component of the T4 category (Fig 4). A superior sulcus tumor (ie, Pancoast tumor) is classifi.ligaed as T4 when there is clear involvement of C8 or superior nerve roots, cords of the brachial plexus, subclavian vessels, vertebral bodies, lamina, or spinal canal, whereas it is categorized as T3 if it involves the thoracic nerve roots only (ie, T1 or T2 nerve roots) (9,12).",

      "title": "N Descriptor: New N2 Categories",
      "content": "Nodal disease is an important prognostic factor in lung cancer staging and has a pivotal role in determining treatment decisions. Historically, the classifi.ligacation of the N descriptor in lung cancer has been based on anatomic location and did not involve the quantifi.ligacation of aff.ligaected lymph nodes. The anatomic location is reported using the IASLC lymph node map, with 14 diff.ligaerent lymph node stations (13,14). When fi.ligandings of an imaging study are interpreted for staging lung cancer, regional node stations should be referred to by their number according to the IASLC lymph node map rather than by their word description (Fig 5). Word node station descriptions diff.ligaer from one radiologist or clinician to another, whereas the nodal station numbers are universally accepted. The use of nodal station numbers helps to ensure that sites of tissue sampling accurately correspond to specifi.ligac  nodal  groups  identifi.ligaed  at imaging.\nAnalyses  conducted  from  TNM-7  and  TNM-8  indicated that the burden of nodal metastases at the hilar and mediastinal  stations  is  linked  to  prognosis  (15).  This  prognostic burden correlation is seen with use of the IASLC lymph node map,  with  use  of  a  simplifi.ligaed  zone  system,  and  even  with enumeration  of  lymph  nodes,  without  assigning  them  an anatomic location (16). However, in TNM-9 it was decided to\ncontinue using the nodal station system because there is no clear  diff.ligaerence  between  station-level  and  zone-level  analyses. Changing defi.liganitions of the anatomic location of nodes to zones would have imposed a major shi/f_t.liga in the way nodes are recorded for staging, complicating matters unnecessarily.\nIt was also decided not to use nodal enumeration for staging  purposes because enumerating lymph nodes is less reliable  than  anatomically  locating  lymph  nodes.  Counting lymph nodes at imaging is imprecise and therefore has no role  in  clinical  staging.  It  is  also  inaccurate  to  count  lymph nodes at pathologic staging because fragmentation of lymph nodes leads to overestimation of the number of lymph nodes, which can occur with sampling of lymph nodes before surgery, at surgical resection, and at specimen handling,\nThere are important nuances in assigning the N descriptor in clinical staging. Details of these nuances tailored to the radiologist have been elaborated (14). Of particular importance is  what  constitutes  an  ipsilateral  or  a  contralateral  lymph node with respect to the primary tumor. For this purpose, the le/f_t.liga  lateral  wall  of  the trachea and not the midline serves as the boundary between the right and le/f_t.liga paratracheal lymph nodes (node stations 2 and 4). In addition, when involved, the subcarinal lymph node (station 7) is considered ipsilateral to the primary tumor, whether the primary lung cancer is in the right or le/f_t.liga lung. Thoracic lymph nodes not mentioned in the IASLC lymph node map including the internal mammary, an-\nterior diaphragmatic, middle diaphragmatic, and intercostal lymph nodes are considered distant (M) metastatic disease and not regional lymph node involvement (N) (Fig 6).\nThe  more  robust  database  of  TNM-9  allows  better  discrimination between categories and optimized stratifi.ligacation, with consideration of nodal metastatic burden (16). The new N classifi.ligacation for TNM-9 is presented in Table 2. The IASLC Staging and Prognostic Factors Committee recommends that the  previous  N0,  N1,  N2,  and  N3  descriptors  be  continued, with the addition of new subdescriptors to N2 (Fig 7) (16).\nThe N1 and N3 categories remain unchanged from TNM-8. The N1 category includes metastasis in ipsilateral peribronchial  and/or  ipsilateral  hilar  lymph  nodes  and  intrapulmonary nodes, including involvement by direct extension (Fig 8).  The  N3  category  comprises  metastasis  in  contralateral mediastinal,  contralateral  hilar,  ipsilateral  or  contralateral scalene, or supraclavicular lymph nodes (Fig 9).\nThe N2 category includes metastasis in ipsilateral mediastinal and/or subcarinal lymph nodes. In TNM-9, the N2 category  is  split  into  single-station  (N2a)  and  multiple-station (N2b) involvement. N2a disease (Fig 10) has a better prognosis  than N2b disease (Fig 11) in both clinical and pathologic classifi.ligacations,  and  the  diff.ligaerences  between  all  neighboring nodal  subcategories  are  highly  signifi.ligacant.  The  prognostic diff.ligaerences  between  N2a  and  N2b  are  robust  and  consistent across resection status, histologic type, T category, and\nA\ngeographic  region  (16).  The  proposed  N2  split  into  subsets also  makes  sense  practically.  Unlike  N1  stations,  which  are diffi.ligacult to distinguish in clinical staging, N2 nodes are readily  distinguished with imaging and invasive clinical staging procedures.  Separating  the  N2  category  better  quantifi.ligaes the burden of disease because it has long been thought that single-station N2 disease has a better prognosis than multiple-station N2 disease (16). This new N2 subset is based on the number of IASLC lymph node stations and not the number of lymph nodes because node enumeration is not reliable.\nThe N0 to N3 descriptors for both clinical and pathologic N staging refer to distinct prognostic groups. The proposed N categories  of  TNM-9  maintain  the  prognostic  discriminatory capacity in patients who received neoadjuvant therapy, including a robust diff.ligaerence between single- versus multiple-station ypN2 disease. However, stage for stage, for patients who have undergone neoadjuvant therapy, the prognosis for each ypN category  is  worse  compared  with  a  similar  pathologic  N  category in patients who did not undergo neoadjuvant therapy.\nPatients who received neoadjuvant therapy and had negative nodes at resection (ypN0) had worse survival outcomes than those with pN0 disease at resection who did not receive neoadjuvant therapy fi.ligarst (16). The same worse prognosis occurs with other N categories and subcategories. The necessity for precise ypN disease characterization is increasing in clinical practice, driven by the prognostic power of ypN descriptors and the increasing adoption of advanced neoadjuvant targeted therapies and immunotherapies. These developments substantially affect the survival outcomes of distinct biomarker-defi.liganed subgroups among patients with lung cancer (17).",

Whole-body staging with fl.ligauorine 18 fl.ligauorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT is widely used, even when metastatic disease is known, because therapy may diff.ligaer according to the metastatic  burden.  Assessments  using  the  TNM-9  database revealed that a higher quantity of metastatic lesions was associated with a poorer prognosis (18). Because this correlation appears to be a continuum, and adjustment for confounders was not possible, no specifi.ligac lesion number was deemed appropriate for stage classifi.ligacation. Among patients with multiple me-\ntastases, a worse prognosis was seen when a greater number of organ systems were involved. The new M classifi.ligacation for TNM-9 is presented in Table 3. The IASLC Staging and Prognostic Factors Committee recommends that the previous M0, M1a, M1b, and M1c descriptors be continued, with the addition of new subsets to the M1c descriptor (Fig 12).\nM1a and M1b categories remain unchanged from TNM-8. The M1a category includes one or more separate contralateral tumor nodules (pleural or pericardial metastasis) (Fig 13).\nM1b involves a single extrathoracic metastasis in a single organ system or a nonregional metastatic lymph node (Fig 14).\nIn  TNM-9,  the  multiple  extrathoracic  metastatic  lesions (M1c) are split into single organ system (M1c1) and multiple organ systems (M1c2) subcategories. M1c1 disease (Fig 15) has a better prognosis than M1c2 disease does (Fig 16). This signifi.ligacantly  better  overall  survival  is  consistent across several statistical approaches and multiple subset analyses (18). It is crucial to comprehend that an organ system can be solitary, paired, or distributed diff.ligausely throughout the body (18). This is straightforward when the area of concern is a localized single organ such as the brain or the liver. Paired organs such as the kidneys or adrenal glands represent one organ system. A diff.ligause  system,  such  as  the  skeleton,  is  also  considered  one\nFigure 8. N1 disease in a 54-year-old man with Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      "title": "Special Entities: Multifocal Lung Adenocarcinoma with Ground-Glass or Lepidic Features and Pneumonic-Type Adenocarcinoma",
      "content": "The TNM-8 staging system for lung cancer was the fi.ligarst to address lung cancers that manifest as multiple discrete nodules\nof lung cancer that show ground-glass or lepidic features. It was also the fi.ligarst to address pneumonic-type lung adenocarcinoma, manifesting as an infi.ligaltrate or consolidation involving a large region of the lung. The staging applied to these two forms of lung cancer remains unchanged in TNM-9. The rationale for applying diff.ligaerent TNM staging rules to these two entities is that they exhibit diff.ligaerent biologic behavior, including survival and recurrence patterns (19,20). These forms of lung cancer should be distinguished from the more common pulmonary metastatic disease, which typically manifests as separate solid nodules, which are assigned a staging descriptor according to their location, whether in the same lobe (T3)\nas the primary lung cancer, in the ipsilateral lung in a diff.ligaerent lobe as the primary lung cancer (T4), or in the contralateral lung (M1a).\nMultifocal  ground-glass  or  lepidic  adenocarcinoma  consists  of  a  primary  subsolid  (usually  part-solid)  adenocarcinoma and multiple separate subsolid (comprising part-solid and pure ground-glass) lung nodules. These separate discrete subsolid nodules may be in the same lobe as the primary ipsilateral  lung,  the  contralateral  lung,  or  both  (19,20).  These additional  nodules  correspond  to  adenocarcinoma  in  situ, minimally invasive adenocarcinoma, or lepidic-predominant adenocarcinoma (19,20). They are hypothesized to be diff.ligaer-\nent primary lung cancers in diff.ligaerent stages of development. In  the  clonality  studies  that  were  performed  in  this  entity, 71%-83% of those nodules studied were indeed of a diff.ligaerent clone, but such studies are few (19). These additional nodules do not need to be biopsied, and staging is applied using the accepted clinical criteria (Table 4). In terms of clinical staging, the highest T descriptor is provided by the dominant nodule. The number of subsolid lesions in both lungs is counted and designated with a number sign (#) in the T descriptor or a lower case 'm' for 'multiple' in parenthesis, with a single N and M for all tumors (highest T[#/m]NM) (Fig 17). A key feature of staging is to not count the small ground-glass nodules\nthat measure up to 5 mm because these are thought to represent atypical adenomatous hyperplasia, a precursor to lung adenocarcinoma. It is important for radiologists  to  identify multifocal lung adenocarcinoma with ground-glass features because the staging and patient treatment are diff.ligaerent from those for pulmonary metastatic disease. These patients have much longer overall survival  time  and  diff.ligaer  in  patterns  of progression. Distant recurrence is unusual, whereas local recurrence and the appearance of new primary lung lesions are more common (19). Consequently, treatment in patients with this entity involves limiting the amount of lung resected; the rest of the nodules are monitored with serial imaging and not resected, thus preserving as much lung as possible (19).\nThe pneumonic-type adenocarcinoma, a rare type of presentation, was also addressed in TNM-8, and staging of this tumor remains unchanged in TNM-9 (19). At CT, these tumors appear as consolidation with or without additional consolidative or ground-glass opacities, either confi.liganed to a segment or lobe or spread diff.ligausely in the lungs. At histologic evaluation, these  tumors  have  a  growth  pattern  with  lepidic  features, predominantly but typically showing invasive mucinous tumor foci (20). It is o/f_t.ligaen  diffi.ligacult  to  measure  the  size  of  the primary tumor accurately in pneumonic-type adenocarcinoma because of its indistinct borders and propensity for what appears as aerogenous spread. Thus, in terms of staging, the pneumonic-type adenocarcinoma is classifi.ligaed as T3 when it\ninvolves one lobe (Fig 18), T4 when it involves one lung, and M1a when it involves both lungs, with a single N and M for all lesions (5,21). Despite the diff.ligause lung involvement, patients with this entity typically do not present with nodal or distant metastases. Survival a/f_t.ligaer resection is worse than that in patients  with  multifocal  lung  adenocarcinoma  with  groundglass or lepidic features (19).",

For these patients, targeted therapy or immunotherapy can contribute to signifi.ligacant survival benefi.ligats (18).\nDespite these limitations, the anatomic staging system for patients  with  newly  diagnosed  lung  cancer  is  robust,  considering available prognostic information. TNM-9 is already available, and imaging interpretation is a key contributor to clinical staging. It is important for radiologists to understand the crucial points in the T, N, and M classifi.ligacations, more so than the fi.liganal stage group. Some of the nuances in the staging descriptors, such as the diff.ligaerence between T1b and T1c, can lead to a diff.ligaerent therapeutic approach, without a substantial change in the overall stage classifi.ligacation. For example, in two recent  randomized  trials  (23,24),  sublobar  resection,  rather than  lobectomy,  was  shown  to  be  a  valid  treatment  option for T1 lung cancers measuring 2 cm or smaller (23-25). The consistent nomenclature of staging classifi.ligacation to describe homogeneous groups of tumors, including tumor measurements, has many applications including evaluating therapy.\nThe data submitted to IASLC and Cancer Research and Biostatistics (CRAB) for the creation of the TNM-9 database were not suffi.ligaciently reliable to permit analysis of the TNM-8 proposal to use suspected invasive component size (solid component at CT) rather than total tumor size (overall size including the ground-glass component) for the T size descriptor for part-solid adenocarcinomas. A potential factor is the timing of the adoption of TNM-8 by the Union for International Cancer Control and the American Joint Committee on Cancer in 2017  (26,27).  Because  the  cases  included  in  the  IASLC  and CRAB database ranged from 2011 to 2019, most of them were submitted before the implementation of this updated tumor measurement defi.liganition (7). Because most of the submitted cases did not provide the total size in addition to the required measurements  of  the  solid-invasive  component,  this  point could not be analyzed, and the current recommendation is to use the solid component only for the T descriptor while also reporting the total size, with the ground-glass component in\nthe  radiology  report.  Application  of  this  principle  in  pathologic stage I to IIA nonmucinous lung adenocarcinomas may result in downstaging of 22% of tumors (28). In addition, the prognostic implication of lymphangitic carcinomatosis could not be evaluated because such data were sparse in the database. Data entry for the TNM database is usually performed by  research  assistants  or  clinicians  using  the  radiology  report. Awareness of the nuances of TNM-9 allows radiologists to provide accurate detailed descriptions for staging not only for individual patients but also for future staging renditions that will rely on these reports.\nThe  reporting  of  multifocal  lung  adenocarcinoma  with ground-glass features in the database was disappointing because only a few were documented in the database. Many of these cases rely heavily on clinical staging; most of these lesions are not resected or sampled until they progress. Radiologists must be aware of this entity in order to provide accurate interpretation. Use of consistent nomenclature in the radiology report allows oncologists and their research assistants to enter the data correctly to contribute to the TNM database.\nIn  terms of future directions, TNM-9 did not address an infrequent presentation of patients with primary lung cancer  featuring  air  lucency  or  cystic  components,  leaving  unresolved the question of whether to assess the cystic or solid components for staging (29). Another area of study concerns patients  who  have  received  neoadjuvant  therapy.  Although overall  survival  was  worse  for  all  patients  who  underwent neoadjuvant  treatment  (ypT)  compared  with  that  for  those who did  not  undergo  induction  therapy,  sample  sizes  were small and the fi.ligandings must be confi.ligarmed in larger patient populations (7).\nRegarding  the  M  component,  metastatic  tumor  burden analysis using the size of the largest metastasis suggested a threshold of 1.2 cm. Although this threshold correlated with a statistically signifi.ligacant  eff.ligaect  on  overall  survival,  the  sample size was too small for validation and generalizability (18). This issue remains for future staging revisions to resolve, it is hoped, with more cases in which metastatic lesion size is documented. For the defi.liganition of oligometastatic disease, multiple cutoff.liga points including three, fi.ligave, and seven extrathoracic metastatic lesions have been examined. Diff.ligaerences in survival suggest that there is a continuum of worsening prognosis with an increasing number of metastatic lesions (18). Another aspect not explored because of insuffi.ligacient data involves determining whether there should be a cap on the number of metastatic lesions within a single organ system. This issue is important because the clinical care of patients with M1c1 disease may vary according to the number of lesions. Exploratory analysis results (18) indicated variations in prognosis among M1 subsets associated with diff.ligaerent organs, particularly the brain, requiring further investigation for future revision.",

Together with other patient information, staging is the foundation to estimate prognosis and predict therapy outcome. One of the strengths of the TNM-9\nSource.-Reference 6.\nstaging system is that stage groupings for both clinical and pathologic staging maintained their statistical signifi.ligacance in  determining  prognosis.  Because  therapeutic  treatment decisions  are  made  with  clinical  staging  before  the  availability of postsurgical pathologic staging, radiologists play a vital role in staging and patient care. A comprehensive understanding of the proposed updates of the TNM-9 staging classifi.ligacation  system  and  the  potential  eff.ligaect  of  staging  on treatment options is key to providing accurate imaging interpretation.\nAuthor  affiliations.From  the  Division  of  Diagnostic  Imaging,  The  Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, 2 Derech Sheba St, Ramat Gan 5265601, Israel (M.K., Z.K., V .S., E.M.M.); Tel Aviv University Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv, Israel (M.K., Z.K., V .S., E.O., E.M.M.); Division of Cardiothoracic Imaging, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, Pa (Z.K.); Department of Thoracic Imaging, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Tex (M.T.T., R.A.); and Institute of Pathology, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Ramat Gan, Israel (E.O.).
