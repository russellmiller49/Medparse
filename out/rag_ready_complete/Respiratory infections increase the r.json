For extrinsic compression, stents are used to strengthen the bronchial wall and provide a barrier against the tumor to keep the airway open. Usually, a multimodality approach is used because fi  ndings are often mixed.\nAlthough airway stenting can be a highly effective treatment of central airway obstruction, several com-\nplications have been identifi  ed. 2-10  Immediate perioperative  complications  are  rare, 11   but  long-term complications are more common and more serious.  1,5 Long-term complications related to stenting include infection, granulation tissue, mucus plugging, stent migration, and stent fracture. 1,5  Of these, granulation tissue is the most common serious complication requiring bronchoscopic intervention.

      "content": "To our knowledge, this is the fi  rst study of airway stents to document and compare the survival and hazard functions of long-term airway complications. Our fi  ndings suggest that signifi  cant differences exist between airway stent types in terms of infection, migration, and granulation tissue risk. In particular, respiratory infections were more frequent in patients with Aero stents, migration was more common with silicone stents, and granulation tissue was associated with preceding respiratory infections and silicone stents. Stent fracture occurred rarely.\nOur fi  ndings build on those of other investigators who have studied the incidence proportions of stent complications. 2-10  An incidence proportion is defi  ned as the number of cases with complications divided by the number of cases overall and is an appropriate measure for analyzing immediate perioperative complications. However, the incidence proportion has signifi  cant limitations when used to analyze long-term complications because one of the fundamental assumptions is that the groups compared have an equivalent time at risk. 17  For example, a higher proportion of stent complications have been observed with benign\na   Extended Cox model.\nFigure 1. Kaplan-Meier plot of time to fi  rst respiratory infection by stent type. Aero stents (dashed line) had a signifi  cantly shorter time to infection than did other stents ( P 5 .043).\ndoes not signifi  cantly affect infection. Considering that silicone stent placement requires that the sterilized  stent be loaded into a nonsterile deployment device that is passed down a nonsterile rigid bronchoscope, this is not surprising.\nConversely, the fi  nding  that  the  relative  risk  of infection was persistently higher with Aero stents, rather than being higher initially and then declining, suggests that it is not sterilization that makes the difference but other factors, such as differences in design or manufacturing. It is interesting to note that the Aero stent is unique among airway stents in that it has a hydrophilic coating designed to prevent mucus\nthere was no signifi  cant difference between stent types ( P 5 .934) (e-Table 3). However, the incidence rate of Aero stent infections was more than double that of other stents ( P 5 .009). Therefore, when evaluating long-term complication rates, it is desirable to compare hazard functions. Our study adds to the body of evidence previously reported because it is the fi  rst to use survival analysis methods to quantify the incidence rates of complications by stent type. To the best of our knowledge, all previous studies used incidence proportions. 2-10\nThis type of analysis also allows us to gain insight into the mechanisms of disease by evaluating the shape of the hazard function. In the immediate perioperative period, infection rates may be high, but after that initial period, the incidence rate can be expected to decline. Thus, if sterilization is necessary to decrease postprocedural infections, we would expect the infection incidence rate in nonsterilized stents, such as the Ultrafl  ex, to be higher initially and then decrease to levels similar to those of sterilized silicone stents. However, although we found that Aero stents were associated with a higher incidence of infection, we found no difference between Ultrafl  ex and silicone stents. This fi  nding suggests that sterilization\ncancer the benefi  ts of lower migration rates may outweigh concerns regarding removal.\nWe also found higher incidence rates of granulation tissue with silicone and Aero stents than with Ultrafl  ex  stents.  Self-expanding  metal  stents  have been believed to lead to more granulation tissue than silicone stents, 20-22  but again this has been based on anecdotal evidence only.\nWe believe the observed differences in granulation tissue may be related to repetitive motion trauma and infection. Repetitive stent motion may cause trauma, with mucosal infl  ammation and granulation tissue formation. 16,23,24   Histologic  studies  of  stents  have shown a nonspecifi  c infl  ammatory response without foreign-body giant cells. 16,24,25  Presumably, stents with higher migration rates also have a higher degree of motion, putting them at increased risk for developing granulation tissue. This is consistent with our observation that silicone stents have a higher incidence of both migration and granulation.\nBacterial infection may also play a role in granulation tissue formation. The available evidence supporting this is limited, with most of the data coming from studies of laryngotracheal reconstruction, tracheal stenosis, and subglottic stenosis. 14-16,23  In a dog model, trauma alone was insuffi  cient to induce granulation tissue, but trauma and bacterial contamination led to granulation tissue. 15  Human studies have shown an association between positive cultures and the presence of granulation tissue, 14,16,23  and airway\nbuild-up. Whether this coating affects infection rates warrants further investigation. It is also important to recognize  that  subtle  but  important  differences  in causation, such as absence of sterilization vs design factors, could not be identifi  ed by simply using incidence proportions because incidence proportions do not  account  for  time  at  risk.  Future  studies  should use appropriate analysis methods.\nApplying this method to other stent complications, we found higher incidence rates of migration among silicone tube stents than among Aero and Ultrafl  ex stents. Silicone tube stents have been believed to migrate more often, 1  but this has been based on anecdotal evidence, and no prior studies have identifi  ed or quantifi  ed the risk using incidence rates. Because silicone stents are easier to remove than expandable metal stents, quantifying the magnitude of the risks and benefi  ts allows physicians to take these factors into consideration when choosing a stent. The advantages of easier removability are important when considering benign disease, but for patients with advanced\na   Extended Cox model.\nThus, for the outcome of overall survival, it may be that the associations observed are more a function of patient selection than the stents themselves. However, we did control for many patient and situational variables, such as stent location, type(s), and timing of adjunctive treatments, and type of obstruction. In  addition, although such selection bias would likely impact survival, it would not likely affect infection rates and/or granulation tissue formation. In addition, for the outcome of infection, such selection biases would favor silicone stents over metal stents, but our data did not suggest a benefi  t for silicone stents. This was also a single-center study focusing on malignant airway obstruction. We do not know if the incidence rates of complications are different in patients with benign disease or with other types of stents, so the results should be interpreted cautiously. Additional multicenter studies will be needed to evaluate stent complications in other populations. Finally, follow-up bronchoscopies were only performed when clinically signifi  cant  symptoms were present. We may have underestimated the occurrence of asymptomatic complications, such as granulation tissue. However, we reviewed all CT images performed subsequent to airway stenting. Because these patients all had malignancy, frequent chest CT imaging was performed for other reasons and did not demonstrate a signifi  cant incidence of undetected asymptomatic airway obstruction. Previous studies have shown that CT imaging can detect up to 97% of stent complications; thus, the probability that a large number of complications were missed is small. 27-29\nIn summary, our fi  ndings reveal that not all airway stents are equivalent. Rates of respiratory infections were higher in patients with Aero stents, migration rates were higher with silicone stents, and granulation  tissue  was  more  common with both of these than with Ultrafl  ex stents. Stent infection and repetitive motion may be related to the development of granulation tissue. Our fi  ndings also highlight the need for  better  postmarketing  surveillance  to  validate whether existing standards for mechanical testing and  airway  stent  manufacturing  are  truly  correlated with clinical outcomes. Registry data may be useful in this regard, but suffi  cient detail and follow-up duration must be available to capture long-term outcomes. 11,30",

      "content": "Author  contributions : Dr  Ost: contributed  to  study  concept, design, data audits, analysis, statistics, writing, and overall study supervision.\nDr Godoy: contributed to radiology reading, data collection, and revision of the manuscript.\nstenting has been found to be associated with frequent  bacterial  colonization. 26   However,  whether infections lead to granulation tissue or whether granulation  tissue  leads  to  obstruction  and  subsequent infection is less clear. This situation is termed reverse causation-when the outcome affects the exposure, rather than the reverse. Previous studies have been unable to address this issue because they correlated cultures with the concurrent presence or absence of granulation tissue. By using time-varying covariates, we were able to address the issue of reverse causation. Our results demonstrate that prior infections are a risk factor for subsequent granulation tissue formation.\nThis is consistent with our observation that Aero stents are associated with a higher incidence of both infection and granulation tissue. In the multivariable model for granulation tissue, after controlling for infection, the Aero stent was not associated with granulation tissue. This fi  nding suggests that the infections associated with the Aero stent drive granulation tissue development, rather than some other structural issue causing trauma. In contrast, silicone stents, which are associated with increased migration, are associated with granulation tissue formation even after adjusting for infection. So both repetitive motion trauma and infection play a role.\nThis study has some limitations. As with all retrospective studies, residual confounding may be present. Selection bias is also a possibility. Expandable metal stents are easier to place than silicone stents, so it may be that sicker patients with more severe airway obstruction were more likely to have metal stents. Similarly, it may be that physicians placed silicone stents in patients they believed were likely to respond to treatment, since silicone stents are easier to remove.\n13  .
