      "content": "Spread through air spaces (STAS) is a lesion where lung cancer tumor cells are identi /uniFB01 ed microscopically beyond the edge of the main tumor in the adjacent alveolar parenchyma. 1 -3 It has been reported in 20% to 40% of surgically resected lung cancers and is associated\nwith poor prognosis as reported in meta-analyses of published reports from institutions worldwide. 4 -9 This association with worse survival has been found in all major histologic types of lung cancer studied, including adenocarcinoma, 1,10 -12 squamous cell carcinoma, 13 small cell carcinoma, 14 large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, 14 , atypical carcinoid, 14 and pleomorphic carcinoma. 6,15\nMultiple investigators have suggested that STAS be incorporated in the TNM stage classi /uniFB01 cation of lung cancer in a variety of ways such as tumor size, residual tumor (R) status, or as a histologic descriptor that could upstage T1 lung cancers to T2a categories similar to visceral pleural invasion (VPI). 10,12,16 -20 Therefore, the role of STAS in lung cancer stage classi /uniFB01 cation was investigated by the Staging and Prognostic Factors Committee (SPFC) of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) in preparing the ninth edition of the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation. We report herein the results of analyses for STAS in completely resected (R0) stage I (T1/T2a N0M0) Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the IASLC ninth edition staging database. The focus of this analysis was to investigate whether STAS could be a useful additional histologic descriptor to supplement the existing ones recognized by both the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) and the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) of VPI, lymphatic/vascular invasion (LVI), and perineural invasion (Pn). 21 -23 It was not a goal of this paper to propose that STAS be used to modify overall stage groupings.",

      "content": "STAS was analyzed for cases diagnosed during the time period of 2016 to 2019, because it was /uniFB01 rst de /uniFB01 ned in 2015. All cases from the IASLC database were included if they had the following: pathologic diagnosis of Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), histologic type, survival time, overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS), surgical resection, and known pathologic stage I N0M0R0 status. 24 Data regarding the presence or absence of STAS were available in 4061 resected Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) including 2934 pathologic (p)T1 (631 pT1a, 1,523 pT1b, 780 pT1c) and 1127 pT2a, N0M0R0 resected NSCLCs. OS and RFS data were available in all patients. Patients with adenocarcinoma in situ, minimally invasive adenocarcinoma, and\nprior history of neoadjuvant therapy were excluded. Neuroendocrine tumors (carcinoids, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma) are the subject of a separate analysis. Cases in which STAS was not evaluated were excluded. If either lymphatic or vascular invasion were reported, then LVI was recorded as a positive result 21,25 ; if both reported no invasion, then LVI was recorded as a negative result. Data on Pn were insuf /uniFB01 cient for analysis. Follow-up time for patients had a range of 0.01 to 6.46 years with a median follow-up for RFS of 3.20 years (95% con /uniFB01 dence interval [CI]: 3.10 -3.23) and 3.14 years (95% CI: 3.10 -3.20) for OS. No molecular data were available for this analysis.\nGrading was provided by the contributing institution according to the Grades 1, 2, 3, and 4 recommended by the UICC and AJCC. 23,26 The IASLC grading system for nonmucinous lung adenocarcinomas could not be used because it was /uniFB01 rst reported in 2020 and the data collection was closed for lung cancers diagnosed in 2019, one year before. 27 As explained in the adenocarcinoma results section, predominant histologic subtype was not used for grading. Using the cases where predominant histologic subtype was available for nonmucinous lung adenocarcinomas, multivariate analyses were performed to determine whether STAS remained independent of histologic subtypes, particularly the poor prognostic subtypes of solid and micropapillary patterns. The not otherwise speci /uniFB01 ed (NOS) category was proposed in the data elements for the Ninth Edition IASLC lung cancer database for adenocarcinomas that did not fall into one of the major histologic subtypes. There is no established grading system for squamous cell carcinoma. 28\nContributions of cases came from Asia (China, South Korea, Taiwan, India, and Turkey) and Australia, North America (United States and Canada), Europe (Italy, Spain, Belgium, and Germany), South America (Brazil, Argentina, and Chile), and Africa (Morocco).\nThe frequency of STAS was compared by sex, age ( < 65 versus /C21 65 y), surgical procedure, histologic type, tumor grade, LVI, tumor size ( /C20 3.0 versus > 3.0 cm), VPI, and other T2 invasion descriptors which correspond to central tumors (involves main bronchus, associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis that extends to the hilar region either involving part of or the entire lung).\nThe end points analyzed were RFS, which was measured from time of surgery to disease recurrence or death from any cause, and OS, which was measured from date of surgery to death from any cause. Univariate and multivariable analysis was performed using Cox proportional hazards models. All multivariable models were adjusted for STAS (present versus absent), and then stepwise selection was used to adjust for other factors with an F statistical signi /uniFB01 cance level of 0.1 for entry and a level of 0.05 to remain in the model. A partial\nlikelihood ratio test was used to identify signi /uniFB01 cant twoway interaction terms maintained in the multivariable model. Survival curves for patients with pathologic stage I (pT1/pT2aN0M0R0) tumors were generated by a Kaplan-Meier estimator with a log-rank test comparing survival based on the presence or absence of STAS. These analyses were performed in the following patient groups: all Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), according to extent of surgical resection (lobar -lobectomy or bilobectomy; sublobar -wedge or segmentectomy), and according to histologic type (adenocarcinoma or ' other Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) ' including squamous cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma or large cell carcinoma). All survival and regression analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute).",

However, stratifying by the submitted grade 1/2 versus 3/4 revealed the expected signi /uniFB01 cant survival results.

Patients undergoing sublobar resection had a 3-year RFS of 92% without STAS compared with 73% with STAS (Fig. 5 A ) ( p < 0.0001) and a 3-year OS of 96% without STAS compared with 83% with STAS (Fig. 5 B ) ( p < 0.0001).\nSTAS remained signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with worse prognosis in both univariate ( p < 0.001/ p < 0.001) and multivariable ( p ¼ 0.001/ p ¼ 0.009) analysis for both RFS/OS, respectively (Tables 11 and 12). For RFS and OS, STAS was independent of age, sex, histology (adenocarcinoma versus other Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)), grade, and LVI. Although LVI was retained as an independent predictor of poor RFS and OS, VPI was not.\nNote : Cohort involves other Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), stage pI, R0.\nCI, 95% con /uniFB01 dence interval; Hazard ratio (HR), hazard ratio; n/N, number with the characteristic/total; STAS, spread through air spaces.\nNote : Cohort involves other Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), stage pI, R0.\nCI, 95% con /uniFB01 dence interval; Hazard ratio (HR), hazard ratio; n/N, number with the characteristic/total; STAS, spread through air spaces.\nWhen included in multivariable analysis for the sublobar resection group, there was no difference in outcome between segmentectomy versus wedge resection either by RFS or OS (Supplementary Table 10).\nOverview of Multivariable Analyses.

This was true in multivariable analysis for both RFS and OS in all patients with Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) regardless of extent of resection (lobectomy or sublobar resection) or histologic type (adenocarcinoma or other Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)). Our /uniFB01 nding that STAS has prognostic value is supported by other many studies as summarized in several meta-analyses. 4 -8 In\nour multivariable analysis, we sought to explore whether STAS was an independent prognostic factor when compared with other histologic descriptors currently recognized by the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation including VPI or LVI. 21 -23,30 Based on our results, we recommend that STAS be added as a new T histologic descriptor for the forthcoming Ninth Edition TNM Classi /uniFB01 cation 24 ;\n/C20\nNote : Cohort involves patients undergoing lobectomy for stage pI Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), R0.\nCI, 95% con /uniFB01 dence interval; Hazard ratio (HR), hazard ratio; n/N, number with the characteristic/total; STAS, spread through air spaces.\nhowever, we do not regard these data to be suf /uniFB01 cient to include STAS into stage grouping. Although this has been proposed by others, 10,12,18 STAS will not be incorporated into proposals for stage groupings in the forthcoming edition of the TNM Classi /uniFB01 cation for lung cancer. 31\nAlthough STAS was found to be consistently associated with OS and RFS in all subgroups evaluated, we were surprised to /uniFB01 nd that the association between VPI and survival outcomes was less consistent in multivariable models. VPI was either an independent predictor or effect modi /uniFB01 er in only two of the 10 RFS subgroup analyses (all Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and adenocarcinoma) and was not found to be associated with OS in any subgroup after adjustment. VPI is an established factor that has been used to upstage T1 tumors to T2 category for the past 46 years since the /uniFB01 rst AJCC TNM classi /uniFB01 cation of lung\ncancers in 1977. 23,24,32 -38 Although, STAS was /uniFB01 rst described in 2015, we were able to assess the impact of STAS in comparison with other histologic descriptors such as LVI and VPI. These analyses suggest that STAS and LVI may be stronger predictors of outcome than VPI.\nSimilar to our /uniFB01 ndings, in studies that included both STAS and VPI in multivariable analysis, STAS seemed to outperform VPI as a predictor for poor outcome. In most studies where both factors were analyzed, STAS, but not VPI, was retained as an independent factor. 9,11,39 -48 In a few studies, both STAS and VPI were independent variables for survival. 42,43 In two of these studies, the results varied between RFS and OS. 42,43 One potential explanation for why STAS might outperform VPI in predicting survival is that VPI can only be found in tumors in contact with the visceral pleura, whereas STAS can be\nNote : Cohort involves patients undergoing sublobar resection of stage pI Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), R0.\nCI, 95% con /uniFB01 dence interval; Hazard ratio (HR), hazard ratio; n/N, number with the characteristic/total; STAS, spread through air spaces.\nNote : Cohort involves patients undergoing sublobar resection of stage pI Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), R0.\nCI, 95% con /uniFB01 dence interval; Hazard ratio (HR), hazard ratio; n/N, number with the characteristic/total; STAS, spread through air spaces.\nobserved not only in tumors with VPI but also those deep within the alveolar parenchyma. Further studies are needed to con /uniFB01 rm the relative importance of STAS and LVI in relation to VPI.\nAlthough the difference was not statistically signi /uniFB01 -cant, the /uniFB01 nding that STAS was found less often in central T2 tumors is logical because tumors in this location are more likely to be endobronchial. Tumors partially or completely surrounded by a bronchus have less interface with the adjacent alveolar parenchyma, and thus they are less likely to have STAS.",

      "title": "Recommendation to Add STAS as a Histologic T Descriptor for Lung Cancer",
      "content": "Staging of cancer is the practice of classifying cancer according to the anatomic extent of tumor. 49 As the presence of STAS re /uniFB02 ects the anatomic extension of tumor into the surrounding lung parenchyma, it is appropriate to consider that it might be useful in lung cancer staging. The UICC and AJCC already recognize LVI and Pn as additional descriptors in the TNM Classi /uniFB01 cations. 22,23,25,30 VPI is an established descriptor that is typically recognized histologically, resulting in T1 tumors to be upstaged to T2a. 23,30,49 Now, based on these new data in the IASLC Lung Cancer Staging Project collected in preparation for the ninth edition of the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation for lung cancer, we reveal results that support adding STAS as a histologic descriptor along with the currently recognized VPI, LVI, and Pn. 23,30,50 It is already recommended to collect data on STAS in the lung cancer synoptic templates proposed by the College of American Pathologists and the International Collaboration on Cancer Reporting. 51,52 On the basis of the recommendations of these leading organizations, and the results of our data, the presence or absence of STAS should be documented systematically in pathology reports of resected lung cancers. Hopefully, it will become a standard element in lung cancer synoptic reports around the world.\nJust as VPI is a T descriptor speci /uniFB01 c only to lung cancer, 23,30 our recommendation is that STAS be added as a histologic descriptor only for lung cancer. This is because of the unique properties of the lung, in which, unlike any other organ system, alveolar spaces can surround the tumor thus providing a compartment of the lung into which tumor cells may spread. For clinical staging, it is not possible to consider adding STAS as a clinical descriptor, because it is a microscopic /uniFB01 nding that cannot be found on computed tomography (CT) imaging. Multiple studies have used standard imaging characteristics or radiomics attempting to preoperatively predict the probability of existence of STAS, 53 -56\nNevertheless, these studies have mainly used surrogate\nmarkers that correspond to aggressiveness of lung cancers such as pulmonary vessel convergence, spiculation, solid component, pleural indentation, mediastinal adenopathy, or pleural thickening. 57 The resolution of CT scans is not high enough to detect the small nests of tumor cells of STAS. In the absence of a way to de /uniFB01 nitively identify STAS by imaging, it cannot be recognized in clinical staging of lung cancer.\nOur study did not analyze the IASLC Lung Cancer Staging Project for STAS in neuroendocrine lung tumors including typical carcinoid, atypical carcinoid, large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, and small cell carcinoma. There is a separate subcommittee of the SPFC who will be analyzing the neuroendocrine tumors in the IASLC database. Nevertheless, previous work has revealed that STAS is an independent predictor of prognosis for large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma and small cell carcinoma. 14,58",

It may be challenging to measure the distance of STAS tumor cells that are the furthest from the tumor edge, due to the frequent collapse of peritumoral alveolar parenchyma. In some cases, the STAS cells may extend beyond the amount of nonneoplastic lung parenchyma surrounding the tumor on a given slide. When this occurs, it may be very dif /uniFB01 cult or impossible to measure the distance of furthest STAS from the tumor edge when these tumor clusters are on different histologic section. Because STAS cannot be appreciated by CT, it also could lead to greater discrepancy between clinical tumor size assessed by CT imaging and pathologic measurement of tumor size. Thus, tumor size should continue to be measured according to the gross or microscopically recognized edge of lung cancers, with adjustment for invasive size in partlepidic nonmucinous adenocarcinomas, rather than according to the maximum distance of furthest STAS.",

Histologic grade, as provided by the contributing institutions, remained an independent predictor of outcome, in the analyses of the (1) overall Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), (2) adenocarcinoma, and (3) lobectomy subgroups. Nevertheless, grade was not signi /uniFB01 cant by multivariable analysis for the other Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and sublobar resection subgroups. In adenocarcinomas, grade had a higher hazard ratio compared with STAS, although STAS remained an independent factor for both RFS and OS. Because the data for grade matched the expected patient outcome and the submitted data for grade did not correspond to current concepts of predominant adenocarcinoma histologic subtyping with almost half of lepidic adenocarcinomas being graded as 2, 3, or 4, it was decided to use grade rather than predominant histologic subtype for survival analyses. The low frequency of the micropapillary-predominant pattern, found in less than 2% of adenocarcinomas, is lower than the 6% found in a meta-analysis by Pyo et al. 60 and in other studies. 61 -63 This raises the question whether the submitted micropapillary pattern data may have been underreported, and this may have affected the survival analysis. We found that STAS was an independent prognostic marker by RFS and OS for the micropapillary-, solid-, acinar-, and papillary-predominant patterns of nonmucinous adenocarcinomas. The proposed IASLC grading system for nonmucinous lung adenocarcinomas could not be implemented because it was published in 2020 and adopted by the 2021 WHO Classi /uniFB01 cation both of which were published after the data collection was closed in 2019. 2,27 Furthermore, the IASLC SPFC database did not collect the percentages of all histologic subtypes, so we could not retrospectively reconstruct that grading system.\nHigh-grade histologic subtypes of lung adenocarcinoma such as micropapillary and solid patterns are also known to be associated with lymphatic and vascular invasion. 64 -66 So, it is no surprise that this association would also be found with another predictor of poor prognosis such as STAS. Recent data from the TRACERx lung adenocarcinoma cohort revealed that disease-free\nsurvival was shorter not only for STAS-positive tumors compared with STAS-negative tumors, but it also was associated with an increased risk only of intrathoracic but not extrathoracic recurrence. 67 Further study is needed to address the relative importance of STAS, LVI, and VPI in determining intrathoracic versus extrathoracic recurrence.",

The original de /uniFB01 nition of STAS by Kadota et al. and the 2015 WHO classi /uniFB01 cation consisted of tumor cells within the /uniFB01 rst alveolar spaces in the lung parenchyma beyond the edge of the main tumor. 1 In adenocarcinoma, it can occur as one of three morphologic patterns, including (1) micropapillary structures within air spaces, (2) solid nests or tumor islands, and (3) scattered discohesive single cells. 1 -3 An important component of the diagnostic criteria that were included in the original description of STAS is the distinction from artifacts. 1 The following features favor an artifact: (1) mechanically induced tumor /uniFB02 oaters that are randomly situated often at the edge of the tissue section or out of the plane of section; (2) jagged edges of tumor cell clusters suggesting fragmentation or edges of a knife cut during specimen processing; (3) isolated tumor clusters at a distance from the tumor rather than spreading in a continuous manner from the tumor edge; and (4) linear strips of cells lifted off alveolar walls. 1 -3 Although it is recognized that in some cases it may be challenging to separate STAS from artifacts, regardless of any debate about its mechanism, the consistent /uniFB01 nding that STAS is an independent prognostic factor in all of our analyses supports that it is a clinically useful histologic factor. 68 Recognition of STAS requires a sample of tumor with the border of the tumor, and STAS tumor cells in the surrounding lung parenchyma, so small biopsy, or cytology specimens should not be obtained to identify STAS.\nSimilar to the TNM recommendations for assessment of other histologic descriptors such as LVI, and Pn, by the AJCC and UICC, 25,69 STAS was recorded as present or absent without any grading of extent. Published data regarding the prognostic signi /uniFB01 cance of STAS focusing on the extent, rather than just positive versus negative, have used various proposed grading schemes and quanti /uniFB01 cation methods. These have not consistently revealed prognostic signi /uniFB01 cance with some revealing\ncorrelations with differences in outcome and others failing to do so. 11,39,42,70 -74 For TNM purposes, we recommend to follow the format of UICC and AJCC recommendations for the other histologic descriptors, so STAS should be recorded as present, absent, or unknown. 25,26",

In particular, the data were based on the IASLC SPFC database, so the results represented the real-world data submitted in recent years, suggesting the clinical feasibility and usefulness of histologic assessment of STAS.

This likely represents underreporting of STAS rather than a lower incidence as many of the papers published about the prognostic signi /uniFB01 cance of STAS are from Japan and China, and they have more comparable frequencies to that found in the North American and European cohorts in the IASLC Ninth Edition database. 12,39,41,77 -80 Because lung cancers submitted to the IASLC database were diagnosed beginning in 2011, 4 to 5 years before STAS was even described, this lower frequency could be due to a variety of causes including slow implementation of pathologists recording STAS in their pathology reports and/or lack of updating of the pathology /uniFB01 elds collected in the databases provided to the IASLC Lung Cancer Staging Project. Because we found that STAS is signi /uniFB01 cant in all our analyses, despite this low frequency in Asia and ROW, it is possible that the results might even be stronger if we had reporting of STAS at the higher frequency documented in the publications from Japan and China.",

To achieve this important objective, the IASLC SPFC counts on the continuous international collaboration of as many institutions as possible and wholeheartedly acknowledges their voluntary contribution of data to the IASLC Lung Cancer Staging Project.\nSeveral important issues not addressed by this manuscript are whether STAS could affect stage groupings similar to VPI, whether the identi /uniFB01 cation of STAS might in /uniFB02 uence extent of surgery, and how STAS might be incorporated into the R classi /uniFB01 cation.
