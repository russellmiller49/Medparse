      "content": "PULMONARY PROCEDURES\nG astrostomy tube placement is one of the oldest modern abdominal surgeries, having been performed for more than a century. 1  Early reports of this surgical technique indicated that it was universally fatal, and it was not until 1875 that Jones reported the fi  rst successful gastrostomy procedure. 2   Prior to 1980, the placement of feeding tubes was limited to surgeons inserting them through an open laparotomy procedure. In 1980, Gauderer et al 3  published a small series in which they described the successful and safe placement of percutaneous feeding tubes in children through endoscopic guidance. Since this initial description, placement of the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube has become the preferred\nprocedure and route for long-term delivery of enteral nutrition in critically ill patients.\nGastroenterologists and surgeons have traditionally placed PEG tubes; however, other specialists who\nhave received appropriate training and satisfi  ed credentialing  requirements  now  perform  this  procedure. In some tertiary-care centers, interventional pulmonologists (IPs) have been performing these procedures. IPs are well suited to perform this procedure  because  of  their  extensive  study  of  thoracic anatomy and the advanced endoscopic and procedural\nBackground: Prior to the 1980s, permanent feeding tube placement was limited to an open surgical procedure until Gauderer and colleagues described the safe placement of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes.

Prospective data were collected on mortality, PEG tube  removal  rate,  total  number  of  days  with  PEG  tube (PEG tube days), and complication rate (procedural and long term). Procedural complications were defi  ned as bleeding (requiring the need for suturing, packing, transfusion, or surgical intervention), inability to complete the procedure once an abdominal incision was made, unintentional abdominal organ puncture, or death (within 24 h of the procedure). Long-term PEG-related complications, such as cellulitis, peritonitis, and PEG tube malfunction, were recorded.\nThe Institutional Review Board at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center approved this study (BIDMC IRB # 2007P-000207) for data collection. For proper credentialing and to independently perform the PEG tube procedure, the institution required supervision of the fi  rst 20 procedures by surgeons and gastroenterologists who were credentialed in performing PEG tube insertion. Given that the IPs in this study practiced in a high-volume center with many years of complex endoscopic experience, there was multidisciplinary agreement that IPs could safely learn and perform esophagoscopies. After adequate volume and competency was achieved, the IP team performed all PEG tube insertions independently.\nStatistical analysis was performed with STATA version 12.1 (StataCorp) and Microsoft Excel version 14.2 (Microsoft Corp) software. Simple descriptive statistics, including mean, median, range, and percentage, were used to describe the data, including complication rates and patient characteristics. Mortality rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method.",

      "content": "We  performed a review of prospectively collected data from February 2003 to April 2007 at a single tertiary-care center. All patients were hospitalized in the medical ICU for various medical conditions. The inclusion criteria were all performed or attempted PEG tube insertions by the IP team. There were no exclusion criteria.\nConsultation for PEG tube placement came from the primary team caring for each patient, and timing depended on clinical need per the attending intensivist. All requests were reviewed by the IP team for the appropriate indication as well as the appropriateness of performing the procedure at the bedside. In most cases, a simultaneous request for bedside percutaneous tracheostomy was included; however, either one of these requests did not infl  uence the other (ie, ability to perform bedside tracheostomy did not infl  uence the ability to perform bedside PEG tube placement and vice versa). Informed consent was obtained from all patients for tracheostomy and PEG tube placement.\nAdministration of anesthesia (including IV anesthesia and muscle relaxation) was performed by an attending anesthesiologist in every case. If the procedure was scheduled as a combined tracheostomy and PEG, the PEG portion of the procedure was performed after the tracheostomy, and patients were continued on the same anesthetic plan. All patients were monitored throughout the  procedure.  All  procedures  were  performed  in  the  patient's room within the medical ICU.\nAll  patients  received preoperative prophylactic antibiotic therapy per current guidelines. 6,7  In those patients already receiving antibiotic therapy with an acceptable spectrum of coverage, no additional therapy was used. All PEG procedures were performed with the pull-through technique described by Gauderer et al. 3 During the study period, two different types of commercial PEG kits (Ponsky Pull PEG Kit; Bard Access Systems, Inc and the Kendall Entristar Safety P.E.G.

      "content": "We have demonstrated that bedside PEG tube placement in critically ill patients can be performed both safely and effectively by trained IP; no procedural complications occurred during PEG tube placement  in  this  cohort.  IPs  have  demonstrated an excellent safety and effi  ciency profi  le in the performance of percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) in critically ill patients. 10  The ability of IP teams to perform bedside PDT and PEG tube placement concurrently can potentially decrease costs, anesthesia exposure, procedural times, ventilator times, and ICU days.\nThere were no major complications recorded in the present cohort. One minor complication occurred in a patient in whom superfi  cial cellulitis developed around the PEG tube insertion site. The cellulitis did not require active intervention aside from more frequent dressing changes because the patient was already receiving antibiotics for an unrelated clinical infection. The overall procedure complication rates were favorable compared with previous studies. 11,12\nA high mortality rate in patients in a medical ICU receiving PEG tubes is not unexpected given the underlying critical illnesses of this cohort. The 30-day mortality rate of 11.94% was excellent compared with 30-day mortality rates of 25% reported in the GI literature 13 ;  the present rate relates to selecting patients who were not clinically worsening and who were anticipated to recover. The 1-year mortality rate of 76% illustrates the underlying substrate of critically ill patients who receive PEG tubes, with prior studies also showing poor long-term survival. 13,14\nmedian follow-up time was 91 days (range, 4-1,594 days). The median PEG tube days was 90 (range, 4-1,573 days). Thirty-four patients died during follow-up. Thirtyday mortality for the entire cohort was 11.94% (eight patients). There were no immediate complications or deaths attributed to PEG tube placement. The 1-year mortality rate was 75.7% (33 deaths). The median survival time from PEG tube insertion was 164 days (  Fig 1  ).\nPEG tube removal occurred in 27 patients, with a median time to removal of 76 days (range, 24-611 days). In the small subset of patients (n 5 7) remaining alive with a PEG tube in place, the median days of follow-up without complication was 255 (range, 44-1,573 days).\nProcedural time for PEG tube insertion was not recorded during the initial credentialing process but was  recorded  after  the  initial  20  cases  were  performed. The average procedural time for PEG tube insertion was 15.8 min (range, 8-25 min).\nNo procedural complications were associated with PEG tube placement. Mild cellulitis around the PEG\nData are presented as median (range) or mean Â± SD, unless otherwise indicated. See Table 1 legend for expansion of abbreviation.\nAppropriate training and supervision in both the evaluation of patients for PEG tube placement and the performance of the actual procedure are paramount in maintaining the safety and effi  cacy associated with the benefi  ts of the procedure. According to the current American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) guidelines, competence is suggested by the performance of 15 PEG procedures and 130 esophagogastroduodenoscopy procedures. The ASGE guidelines also recognize that trainees' skill levels will vary, and the acquisition of cognitive and technical skills needed to perform a specifi  c procedure will vary among trainees. These competency numbers are based on a novice learner, taking into account the acquisition of new skills needed, such as hand-eye coordination, manually handling the gastroscope dials, and intubating key structures. 17\nCurrently, no data exist to provide evidence-based recommendations with regard to the number of PEG tube insertions needed for IPs to be considered competent. Although the ASGE guidelines recommend 15 PEG tube placements, our institution (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center) requested the performance of 20 pro  ctored PEG tube insertion procedures. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education has documented that the mean number of PEG tube insertion procedures completed by general surgical residents at the end of their training is 11. 18  Although no defi  nitive numbers are available for IP performance of PEG tube insertion, many advanced endoscopy skills have been mastered during IP fellowship because of the multitude of procedures and the advanced training IP professionals receive. 4,5 In fact, numerous stud  ies have demonstrated successful IP use of endobronchial and endoscopic ultrasound-guided procedures in the investigation of hilar and mediastinal adenopathy. 19-22 The present study, however, was not intended to be a reference for establishing the number of PEG tubes procedures required to defi  ne competence.\nIn conclusion, bedside PEG tube placement in critically ill patients can be performed both safely and effectively by trained IPs within an appropriate multidisciplinary team. This team must be equipped to handle the multiple complexities that are inherent in caring for critically ill patients.",

The average procedural time for PEG tube insertion was , 16 min (range, 8-25 min). When performed at the same time as PDT, the additional anesthesia requirements to place a PEG tube were minimal.\nThe goal of PEG tube placement is to provide enteral nutrition with the hope of not only prolonging the quantity of life but also the quality of life; therefore, it is important to select patients who are most likely to benefi  t from the procedure. 15 Ideally, critically ill patients will recover their ability to swallow and have their PEG tubes removed. In the present study, the PEG tube removal rate was 38% (27 of 70) in all patients and 73% (27 of 37) in the patients who did not die during the study follow-up, suggesting appropriate patient selection with the goal of removal  .\nFor two patients within the cohort, the IP did not complete initial PEG tube placement because of technical issues. There were no complications related to these unsuccessful procedures or to the follow-up procedures performed by the surgery and gastroenterology teams. The data demonstrate a similar failure rate for PEG tube placement as documented by senior surgical residents under direct faculty supervision (3.5%). 12  We believe that the ability to work in a multidisciplinary fashion allows for the safe and effective performance of these procedures in a critically ill  population.  We  also  demonstrated  this  type  of safe and effective multidisciplinary care of critically ill patients in the performance of bedside PDT. 10\nOne limitation of the study is that we did not collect data on the number of patients who refused bedside PEG tube placement by the IP team. We did not prospectively record all consultations for PEG placement; therefore, the potential for referral to other specialties exists. Anecdotally, this would represent a minority of patients because we were unaware of any PEG tube placements being performed within the medical ICU by services other than the IP team. We believe it is important that all patients considered for bedside PEG tube placement undergo a standardized evaluation to determine whether they are appropriate candidates for the procedure. Our general practice has excluded the placement of PEG tubes by our team in the following situations: morbid obesity (BMI . 50 kg/m 2 ), signifi  cant ascites, concern for active peritonitis, prior gastric surgery (prior PEG tube placement excluded), uncorrectable coagulopathy, and known GI pathology (ie, esophageal varices, gastric outlet obstruction). Patients with these conditions are referred to our surgical or GI colleagues for feeding tube placement. Likewise, the procedure would be aborted and referred to our surgical and GI colleagues if adequate transillumination could not be visualized. 16\nDr Ernst: contributed to the collection of the initial data, data review and analysis, and writing of the manuscript.\nDr Feller-Kopman: contributed to the collection of the initial data, data review and analysis, and writing of the manuscript.\nFinancial/nonfi  nancial disclosures: The authors have reported to CHEST that no potential confl  icts of interest exist with any companies/organizations whose products or services may be discussed in this article  .\nOther contributions: All work and analyses were completed at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and The Johns Hopkins Hospital.",
