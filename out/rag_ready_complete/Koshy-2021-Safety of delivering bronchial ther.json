    "abstract": "Background: Bronchial thermoplasty (BT) is a novel endoscopic therapy for severe asthma. Traditionally it is performed in three separate treatment sessions, targeting different portions of the lung, and each requires an anaesthetic and hospital admission. Compression of treatment into 2 sessions would present a more convenient alternative for patients. In this prospective observational study, the safety of compressing BT into two treatment sessions was compared with the traditional 3 treatment approach. Methods: Sixteen patients meeting ERS/ATS criteria for severe asthma consented to participate in an accelerated treatment schedule (ABT), which treated the whole left lung followed by the right lung four weeks later. The shortterm outcomes of these patients were compared with 37 patients treated with conventional BT scheduling (CBT). The outcome measures used to assess safety were (1) the requirement to remain in hospital beyond the electively planned 24-h admission and (2) the need for re-admission for any cause within of 30 days of treatment. Results: The total number of radiofrequency activations delivered in the ABT group was similar to CBT (187 ± 21 vs 176 ± 40, p = 0.326). With ABT, 11 in 31 admissions (37.9%) required prolonged admission due to wheezing, compared to 5.4% with CBT (p = 0.0025). The mean hospital length of stay with ABT was 1.8 ± 1.3 days, compared to 1.1 ± 0.4 days (p < 0.001). ICU monitoring was required on 5 occasions with ABT (16.1%), compared to 0.9% with CBT (p = 0.002). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that females were more likely to require prolonged admission (Odds ratio (OR) 11.6, p = 0.0025). The 30-day hospital readmission rate was similar for both groups (6.4% vs 5.4%, p = 0.67). All patients made a complete recovery after treatment with similar outcomes at the 6-month follow-up reassessment. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that ABT results in greater short-term deterioration in lung function associated with a greater risk of prolonged hospital and ICU stay, predominantly affecting females. Therefore, in females, these risks need to be balanced against the convenience of fewer treatment sessions. In males, it may be an advantage to compress treatment. © The Author(s) 2021.

      "content": "Bronchial  thermoplasty  (BT)  is  a  bronchoscopic,  nonpharmacological  intervention  for  the  management  of asthma.  It  offers  an  alternative  therapeutic  option  for those with severe asthma, defined by the Global Initiative\nfor  Asthma  (GINA)  as  those  with  persistent  symptoms requiring step 5 of controller treatment [1]. BT involves the delivery of radiofrequency energy to distal airways of 2-10 mm in diameter, using a catheter electrode introduced by a flexible bronchoscope [2]. The goal of treatment is to induce atrophy in the airway smooth muscle layer,  which  is  known  to  be  hypertrophied  in  severe asthma  [3,  4].  Treatment  benefits  have  been  established  in  three  randomised  controlled  trials,  and  three real-world  registries,  which  have  each  demonstrated\n2 Hastings Road, Frankston, VIC 3199, Australia\nFull list of author information is available at the end of the article\nimproved symptom control and quality of life scores, and reduced exacerbation frequency [5-10].\nThe  major  adverse  effect  of  bronchial  thermoplasty is  short-term  aggravation  of  asthma  in  the  immediate post-operative  period  [2].  Following  BT,  an  average  fall in post-bronchodilator Forced Expiratory Volume in 1-s (FEV1)  of  9%  has  been  reported  [11].  This  is  maximal 24 h post procedure, after which there is steady recovery. The degree of fall in FEV1 is proportional to the quantum of  radiofrequency  treatment  applied  [11].  Historically, BT has been divided into 3 treatment sessions, separated by 3-4 weeks, each treating different portions of the lung [2]. However, this treatment plan does mean that patients require  three  separate  hospital  admissions  with  three separate  anaesthetics  to  complete  their  treatment.  This adds to the cost and the inconvenience of the treatment, particularly when patients live remotely to the treatment centre. If patients could be safely treated in two sessions rather than three, this would be a more attractive proposition for patients, doctors, hospitals and health funds.\nTherefore,  the  aim  of  this  study  was  to  investigate whether BT could be safely  compressed  into  two  treatment sessions.",

These events were established by medical record  review  and  by  direct  patient  enquiry.  The  frequency  of  adverse  events  were  compared  between  the accelerated  treatment  group  and  the  cohort  of  patients who  had  received  conventional  BT.  In  addition,  a  calibrated portable spirometer (Jaeger Vyntus  Pneumo, Carefusion, Germany) was used to record the post bronchodilator  FEV1  immediately  preoperatively  in  theatre, and then again, in the ward 24 h later, in order to quantify the fall in FEV1 post procedure. This data was available for all 16 patients treated with the accelerated treatment plan, but only available for 20 of the 37 patients treated with standard BT.\nSecondary outcome measurements related to the therapeutic effects of BT. All patients were evaluated at baseline,  4  weeks  prior  to  the  initial  BT  procedure,  by  age, gender, BMI, medication history, exacerbation frequency, spirometry and the Asthma  Control Questionnaire, 5-item  version  [13].  Permission  to  use  this  instrument had been specifically  granted  to  us  by  its  author,  Elizabeth Juniper. Exacerbations were defined by the need for an increase in oral corticosteroids for 3 days. Evaluations were  repeated  6  months  after  the  completion  of  all  BT procedures.\nSpirometry  was  undertaken  in  an  accredited  laboratory  by  experienced  respiratory  scientists,  and  to  ERS/ ATS  standards,  using  the  Jaeger  Vyntus  Body  (Carefusion,  Germany)  calibrated  on  the  day  of  patient  testing [14].

This was expected because many of the  conventionally  treated  patients  underwent  BT  prior to the availability of anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody  therapy  in  Australia  (January  2017).  As  a  result, those patients undergoing BT in the latter years, and by the accelerated treatment approach, were more likely to be already being treated with biological therapy, and yet,\ndespite this, still severely symptomatic.

This particular patient was average for the group in terms of baseline FEV1% predicted, ACQ, prednisolone dose and requirement for bronchodilators. However, they were of a  particularly anxious predisposition, which the authors believe to be the main reason treatment was not continued. The 37 patients treated with conventional BT completed all 111 treatments.\nThe total  number of radiofrequency activations delivered  was  similar  in  both  patient  groups -187 ± 21  in the  accelerated  treatment  group,  compared  to  176 ± 40 in the conventional treatment approach (p = 0.326). Thus,  both  groups  received  a  similar  quantum  of  treatment  independent  of  the  scheduling.  In  practice,  this meant that when the whole left lung was treated in the accelerated  treatment  group,  100 ± 17  activations  were administered in one session, by comparison with 49 ± 14 activations  when  just  the  left  lower  lobe  was  treated  in the  conventional  approach  (p < 0.001).  Similarly,  on  the right side, 89 ± 21  activations were delivered in one session  to  the  right  lung  in  the  accelerated  protocol,  compared  with  48 ± 17  activations  to  the  right  lower  lobe with the conventional approach (p < 0.001). In our centre, we allow 45 min of theatre time for each booked BT case. Although the operating time was 10 min longer when a whole lung was treated by BT, every case was completed within the allowed usual theatre time, and without altering subsequent theatre scheduling.\nThe mean fall in post bronchodilator FEV1 24 h after BT  was  403 ± 352  ml,  or  22.6 ± 16.4%  with  accelerated treatment. This was significantly greater than when either the  right  or  left  lower  lobes  were  treated  with  conventional scheduling, where the fall after treatment in FEV1 was 114 ± 243 ml Odds ratio (or) 5.0 ± 15.0% (p = 0.001). However, the fall in FEV1 after conventional upper lobe treatment was not  statistically  different  from  treating  either  the  whole left Odds ratio (or) right lung (p = 0.203) (Table 2).",

The  mean hospital length of stay for patients receiving accelerated treatment was 1.8 ± 1.3 days, compared to 1.1 ± 0.4 days in  the  standard  group  (p < 0.001).  No  patient  required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, but there were 5 occasions in the accelerated treatment group (16.1%) when patients required monitoring in the Intensive Care Unit, compared to 1 occasion (0.9%) in the standard treatment group (p = 0.002).\nTwo patients (6.4%) in the accelerated treatment group were readmitted within 30 days of a BT procedure, one for  pneumonia  and  one  for  non-ischaemic  chest  pain. Both made a full recovery. This readmission rate was similar in the standard treatment group (5.4%, p = 0.670).\nIn the accelerated treatment group, a subgroup analysis was conducted to compare the baseline characteristics of those patients who remained in hospital longer than 24 h with those who were discharged within 24 h as originally planned. These results are shown in Table 3. Across most parameters,  there  were  no  distinguishing  differences. However, there appeared to be a gender difference. For males,  there  was  a  1  in  14  admissions  chance  (7.1%)  of\nremaining  in  hospital  after  24  h  with  accelerated  treatment, whilst in females this chance was 6 in 17 admissions  (35.2%)  (p = 0.090).  Interestingly,  in  our  standard treatment group, all 6 instances of prolonged admission were also all females. Hence, for the pooled group of 53 patients  undergoing  142  BT  procedures,  there  was  one male admission (1.4%) and 12 female admissions (16.2%) longer than 24 h, resulting in an odds ratio for prolonged hospital stay of 11.6 females to males (p = 0.0025).\nTo explore why there was a higher adverse event rate in  females,  two  further  comparisons  were  made.  The baseline characteristics of the 28 females were compared with 25 males (Table 4). Overall, both groups of patients were  found  to  be  very  similar,  but,  as  expected,  males had larger lungs. Therefore, the fall in lung capacity following  BT  treatment  was  compared  by  gender  for  the pooled group of 36 patients (19 female, 17 male) where FEV1 had been measured routinely 24 h post procedure. This comparison is shown in Table 5. The data suggests that the percentage fall in FEV1 post BT is significantly less in males, who are protected by higher baseline lung volumes.\nMean ± standard deviation p compares the FEV1 on day 1 with day 0 by paired t test\nFEV1: Forced Expiratory Volume in 1-s (litre)\nMedian (Interquartile range), p: Mann-Whitney U test a : Fisher's exact test.

      "content": "This is the first study to examine the delivery of BT in two treatment sessions, and make comparisons with conventional  treatment  in  three  sessions.  Whilst  both  groups of  patients  experienced favourable and comparable outcomes at  six  months,  a  higher  prevalence  of  prolonged admission was observed in the accelerated group immediately post-procedure (37.9% vs 5.4%). The implications of this will be explored.\nThis was a cohort of patients with very severe asthma. They  had  a  high  symptom  burden  despite  biological therapies and oral steroids, and the mean FEV1 of 45.9% predicted was considerably lower than participants in the AIR  and  AIR  2  trials  (whose  participants  had  an  FEV1 of > 60% predicted), and RISA of > 50% predicted [16-18]. It  is  common  for  asthma  symptoms  to  initially  worsen as  the  result  of  acute  airway  inflammation  and  oedema from BT [19]. Those in the accelerated group had a larger number  of  airways  treated  in  each  session,  and  previous  studies  have  demonstrated  a  relationship  between higher activations delivered and a greater decline in FEV1 [11].  This  finding  is  supported  by  the  greater  decline  in FEV1 observed 24 h post-procedure with the accelerated treatment  in  this  study.  Therefore,  it  is  not  surprising that these patients took longer to recover. Nevertheless, the effects seen in the accelerated group were transient. The mean hospital stay was 1.8 ± 1.3 days, and, following\nMean ± standard deviation, median (Interquartile range) p: t-test a : Mann Whitney U test\nBMI body mass index, ACQ Asthma control Questionnaire, FEV1 forced expiratory volume 1-s, SABA short acting beta agonist Inhaled steroids; beclomethasone equivalent dose in micrograms\np = Wilcoxon signed rank test ACQ: Asthma Control Questionnaire, SABA short acting beta agonist, FEV1 forced expiratory volume 1 s\nhospital discharge, the readmission rate was low and similar between the two treatment groups.\nThe  subgroup  analysis  suggests  that  the  risk  of  prolonged  hospital  admission  following  BT  pertained  predominantly to females, and this occurred irrespective of the treatment regimen delivered. This has not been previously noted. The three randomized controlled trials of BT did  not  present  a  breakdown  of  adverse  effects  by  gender. The odds ratio of 11.6 for prolonged hospital stay in females is so strong in this study it seems unlikely to have occurred by chance. Table 4 demonstrates the similarity in  clinical  characteristics  here  between  the  females  and males, save for the expected anthropomorphic difference of  a  lower  absolute  FEV1  in  females.  We  postulate  that this may be a factor in the higher post-operative adverse event rate in females. The volume change in FEV1 after BT appears to be at least as great in females as males, but with females starting from a lower baseline, the impact of the deterioration becomes substantially greater (Table 5).\nThere  are  attractions  to  performing  BT  in  fewer  sessions. Hospital admission and post-operative recovery  are  disruptive  to  a  patient's  life.  Patients  in  this study  were  generally  enthusiastic  about  the  concept  of compressing  treatment  into  two  sessions,  even  when informed of a potential risk of a longer hospital stay. This became a particularly strong advantage for patients who lived interstate or remotely to the treatment centre. Some patients  also  felt  it  was  a  significant  advantage  in  having two anaesthetics rather than three. This study demonstrates that there is obviously a trade-off between the convenience of two treatments and the inconvenience of greater short-term post-operative deterioration.\nThere are also differing economic implications depending on the drivers in health services. In a country where access to theatre is a major constraint in the delivery of surgery, such as in a publicly funded healthcare system, the  ability  to  perform  BT  in  two  treatments  is  a  significant  step  forward,  and  would  reduce  surgical  wait times.  On the other hand, in areas where the high cost of an overnight hospital bed is the predominant driver in healthcare delivery, such as the United States of America, bronchoscopists may be better to continue to offer traditional 3 session BT on a day-case basis. In such a country, an alternative approach to improve patient convenience, may  be  to  offer  single  treatment,  limited  BT,  targeted by  preprocedural  hyperpolarized  Magnetic  Resonance Imaging (MRI) [20]. This technique shows great promise, but is currently severely limited by the lack of availability of hyperpolarized MRI in most centres.\nBeing a feasibility study, the numbers of patients studied here were deliberately small, as we were concentrating  on  establishing  patient  safety  in  the  first  instance.\nThe technique would need repeating on a larger scale before firm recommendations could be made. We must acknowledge that this study was non-randomized, and  that  time  dependent  differences  between  the  two patient  groups  are  evident.  However,  given  that  the accelerated treatment group were a more severe group of asthmatics, this would serve to exaggerate any differences in safety between the two techniques rather than provide false reassurance. In that sense, this is unlikely to  be  a  limitation  and  the  results  presented  are  more akin to a worst-case scenario.\nThis  study  shows  that  it  is  possible  to  compress  BT into  two  treatments,  and  it  appears  particularly  safe to  do  so  in  males.  However,  there  is  a  penalty  to  pay by taking this approach, namely a greater fall in FEV1 in  the  immediate  postoperative  period.  Therefore,  at our centre, we are not offering this approach to those patients  whose  baseline  FEV1  is  less  than  50%  predicted, until further data becomes available.\nImproving and refining treatment procedures to minimise  patient  discomfort  and  maximise  efficiency is a natural development in the evolution of any medical  procedure.  Further  research  on  a  larger  scale  is required  to  confirm  our  results,  but  accelerating  the delivery of BT appears to be safe in some patients without compromising clinical outcomes.",
