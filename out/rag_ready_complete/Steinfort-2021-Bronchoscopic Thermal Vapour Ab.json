      "title": "Introduction",
      "content": "Surgical resection with lobectomy is currently the recommended therapy for management of localized (Stage I) non-small cell lung cancer (Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)) [1]; however, surgery is precluded in many patients by the presence of significant  comorbidities  or  frailty  [2].  Targeted  ablation techniques may be used for such patients with curative intent and may be non-invasive (e.g., stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy) [3] or invasive (varied percutaneous techniques) [4, 5]. These techniques may be limited in many patients due to anatomic location of tumour or to clinical features such as multifocal disease, ground glass lesions, or underlying pulmonary disease (e.g., fibrosis) [6-8].\nBronchoscopic thermal vapour ablation (BTVA) is an established and approved modality for minimally invasive lung volume reduction in severe emphysema. Targeted delivery of thermal energy induces an inflammatory reaction within treated pulmonary segments resulting  in  fibrosis  and  shrinkage  of  the  segment,  and consequent lung volume reduction [9].\nSubsequent modification of the emphysema treatment catheter  allowed  for  delivery  of  thermal  energy  from  a point beyond sub-segmental level. Greater energy delivery (per volume of lung) could be delivered and in an in vivo porcine model was shown to achieve a uniform field of necrosis which followed the sub-segmental anatomical boundary  [10].  Subsequent  ex  vivo  studies  in  human lungs demonstrated that with sufficient energy delivery, uniform ablation was achieved [11], indicating a potential role  for  BTVA  in  the  minimally  invasive  treatment  of lung cancer.\nThis study aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of a novel BTVA for lung cancer (BTVA-C) system for minimally  invasive  treatment  of  peripheral  pulmonary tumours  in  this  treat-and-resect  study.  Secondary  end points regarding distribution of thermal injury and uniformity of necrosis following BTVA-C are also presented in detail to examine potential efficacy of the treatment.",

      "content": "Study Design and End Points\nThis prospective, single-arm, treat-and-resect study was conducted at a single tertiary centre (Royal Melbourne Hospital) in Victoria, Australia, between December 2018 and August 2019. Patients with microscopic proof of malignancy suitable for resection via lobectomy were considered for inclusion in the study. Lesions were required to be ≤20 mm and positioned within the outer third\nof the lung. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are recorded in online suppl. File 1; for all online suppl. material, see www.karger.com/doi/10.1159/000514109.\nPre-procedure planning of treatment was established based on analysis of the patient's diagnostic CT chest by commercially available  quantitative  pulmonary image analysis software - Apollo ® Software (VIDA, Coralville, IA, USA) and by a commercially available virtual bronchoscopy navigation system - Archimedes ® Planner (Broncus Medical Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). Details are presented in online suppl. File 2.\nBronchoscopic Thermal Vapour Ablation for Lung Cancer Device\nThe BTVA-C system is comprised of 3 components: (i) a sterile, disposable vapour delivery catheter (shown in Fig. 1), (ii) generator with attached handpiece, and (iii) water line kit. The generator consists of a graphic user interface to enter control parameters, an electronically controlled syringe pump for controlled delivery of sterile water to its handpiece, and a flow-based technology which creates resistive heating to convert sterile water into thermal vapour. The BTVA-C catheter is connected to the generator's handpiece and delivers the vapour to the patient. Sterile water is delivered via the water line kit to the handpiece where resistive heating converts sterile water into thermal vapour.\nThe catheter is a sterile, disposable, non-reusable device used to deliver vapour from the generator handpiece to the targeted airway. The catheter is very similar in design, construction, and use of the InterVapor catheter used for the treatment of emphysema.\nAblation Procedure and Post-Ablation Assessment\nProcedures were performed under general anaesthesia. Bronchoscopic  navigation  to  the  target  airway  was  performed  using\nstandard videobronchoscopy (BF-P190, Olympus. Tokyo, Japan). Bronchoscopic navigation to target segment was aided by Archimedes planning software, as previously described [12]. Confirmation of position 'on-target' with radial Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) was confirmed where possible. Patients receiving 'on-target' treatments received a single treatment in this safety/feasibility study. In patients where ontarget treatment could not be confirmed with radial Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), 2 treatments were used to maximized likelihood that the tumour would be included within the treatment volume.\nThe BTVA-C system was programmed to deliver 330 calories per treatment of thermal energy over 8 s. Prophylactic broad-spectrum  antibiotics  were  administered  during  the  procedure  (1  g amoxycillin IV). Following the procedure, participants were electively admitted overnight for routine observation following their BTVA-C procedures. Oral antibiotics (amoxycillin 1 g tds) was prescribed on discharge and continued until day of surgery.\nPost-ablation CT chest was performed 1 day prior to plan surgical resection to visualize the area of localized inflammatory response (LIR) in relation to the original tumour location. Thoracoscopic lobectomy together with systematic nodal dissection was performed by a dedicated thoracic surgeon. All patients were followed until 30 days post-resection.",

Size of ablation size was measured in the axial and lateral directions based  on  the  gross  pathological  pictures  (with  scale)  combined with the estimated slice depth. The axial and lateral measurements were aided by the histological examination to assure that structures and observations in the gross pathology pictures correlated to histological features.\nGlass  slides  were  reviewed  using  an  Olympus  BX41  microscope, and microscopic photographs were obtained with an Olympus DP27 camera and Olympus cellSens Entry software. Microscopic measurements were made using an eyepiece reticule for lesions confined to 1 glass slide or using a ruler after outlining areas of interest with a dotting pen and reconstructing the anatomy for lesions that bridged multiple glass slides. Pathologic review was performed blinded to any clinical information including diagnosis, imaging, treatment details, or surgical findings.\nParenchymal  necrosis  was  identified  as  non-neoplastic  lung that  demonstrated  pneumocyte  and  interstitial  necrosis,  often with accompanying haemorrhage. Tumour necrosis was identified\nas  neoplastic  tissue  exhibiting  cytoplasmic  hyper-eosinophilia, loss of cellular borders, and nuclear changes of cell death (karryorhexis,  karryolysis,  or  pyknosis);  these  changes  were  typically seen in both the malignant cells and tumour stroma.

His  BTVA-C was complicated by pleuritic chest pain, managed electively with intravenous antibiotics, resulting in an extra day  admission  in  hospital.  A  brief  inflammatory  response was observed, with CRP and neutrophil count peaking at day 4 (220 mg/mL) and day 2 (16.8 × 10 9 ), respectively. At planned resection, he tolerated singlelung ventilation poorly, and planned anatomic resection was abandoned.\nThe remaining 5 patients who proceeded to surgical lobectomy of their tumours form the basis of this report and are presented in detail below. Radiologic details and treatment parameters are recorded in Table 1. Median size of solid component of tumour was 1.32±0.36 cm. Patient 2 reported moderate pleuritic chest pain requiring oral opioids on day 1 post-BTVA-C. This had resolved by the time of resection.

      "title": "Discussion",
      "content": "Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of BTVA for ablation of peripheral parenchymal cancers. Four patients with  confirmation  of  'on-target'  treatment  by  radial Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) achieved large uniform ablation zones, even where a single treatment was delivered, provided thermal dose exceeded 3 Cal/mL. In 2 participants, BTVA-C achieved complete/near-complete necrosis (100 and 98%) of target lesions. Median procedure duration was just 12 min.\nSafety also appears consistent with known safety profile of BTVA for treatment of emphysema. No infection, pneumothorax, or haemoptysis were reported within the\nshort  post-interventional  observation  period.  Two  patients experienced post-ablation chest pain, likely reflecting exuberant pleural inflammation secondary to thermal ablation, reflected in changes on CT chest (Fig. 3). This was not a noted complication of BTVA and possibly reflects the higher dose per treated volume received in these patients (50.6 cal/g, compared to 8.5 cal/g in emphysema therapy [9]). Importantly, these events were self-limiting. Major complications observed were assessed as not related  to  the  treatment  or  device,  instead  reflecting  the known complications of surgical lobectomy (persistent air leak is reported in 10% of patients following VATS lobectomy [13], major vascular injury in 3-8% [14, 15]).\nOur findings indicate the potential for effective bronchoscopic ablation of peripheral tumours using readily available tools of radial Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and virtual bronchoscopy for treatment planning. The intervention was well tolerated with minor self-limiting complication observed in 1 patient who experienced pleuritic chest pain, associated with a small pleural effusion, suggesting pleural inflammation. This did not warrant intervention beyond oral analgesia and did not complicate surgery or post-operative recovery. Our findings are, therefore, reassuring regarding tolerability of the treatment in patients with compromised physiology. Radial Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) is demonstrated safe even in patients with advanced Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [16], and BTVA is established for use in patients with advanced emphysema [9], suggesting this technique will be feasible in patients\nwith compromised physiology, which is the group this modality is likely to be applied to.\nThermal doses used in this study are significantly lower  than  for  BTVA  for  treatment  of  emphysema  (target dose 330 Cal vs. average dose in STEP-UP study of 399 Cal [9]), though at higher concentrations (cal/mL). Ablation zones  were  well  demarcated  both  on  post-ablation  CT chest and on histologic examination. Tumour positioned within ablation zones demonstrated necrosis in >99% of cross-sectional area examined. The only viable area within an ablation zone appeared to be in an area of pleural invasion deep to a central scar. Fibrosis and central scars in the other patients did not appear to diminish the efficacy of the vapour ablation. It may be that some combination  of  the  pleural  invasion,  central  scar,  and  distance from the ablation catheter led to this result. As this was the only patient with pleural invasion in this cohort, it will be important to evaluate areas of pleural invasion in future patients to determine whether pleural vessels exert a heatsink effect, if pleural tissue is intrinsically heat-resistant, or if a large distance from catheter tip to pleura allows significant dissipation of thermal energy by the time vapour reaches the pleura, compromising ablative efficacy.\nPersistence of viable tumour in resection specimens was most frequently noted outside the parenchymal ablation zone. Ensuring treatments fully encompass the target lesion  will  be  important  in  future  studies  of  this  technique, either via more accurate targeting of treatments or use  of  multiple  treatments.  Intra-procedural  imaging may also aid in ensuring target is fully encompassed in ablation zones [17].\nGreater extent of tumour necrosis may have been observed within treatment zone with a longer interval from ablation to resection (median in this cohort 5 days). Cells receiving lower, but still lethal, thermal injury may have progressed to histologically evident necrotic cell death. Similarly, damage to blood vessels following thermal injury within and around the zone of parenchymal necrosis may produce delayed thrombosis and avascular/hypoxic death of tumour initially appearing viable. Further studies  with  longer  ablation-to-resection  intervals  are  required to address this finding.\nFrom this limited experience, we identify some significant findings regarding the efficacy of BTVA-C. Treatment volume appears to be significant. If treatment volume is too large, thermal injury is limited to main airways and adjacent parenchyma. Reducing treatment volumes (likely through more distal delivery of BTVA-C) and ensuring sufficient energy per mL parenchyma are likely to be important in future work.\nSurgical  resection  has  remained  standard  of  care  for treatment of early stage Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) since the 1950s. Lobectomy is clearly preferred to sub-lobar resection, based on superior survival outcomes, however, may be problematic in patients with limited functional reserve. Perioperative mortality following lobectomy exceeds 1.5% and does not appear to be smaller following sub-lobar resection [18]. Stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy has proven efficacy, however, is  limited  in  patients  with  underlying pulmonary disease (e.g., fibrosis) [7, 8], tumours positioned proximal to central airways [19], or previous radiation treatment.\nBronchoscopic ablation is likely to be significantly safer than current percutaneous techniques, which are associated with pneumothorax rates up to 60% [4] and intercostal  drain  requirement  in  up  to  38%  [5],  which  is clearly problematic for a modality likely to be applied in multiply comorbid patients. Haemorrhage, haemoptysis, and effusion are also frequently reported complications following percutaneous tumour ablation [20]. In physiologically frail patients, bronchoscopic ablation may allow diagnosis (using rapid on-site evaluation [21]), staging [22], and treatment to be completed in a single procedure.  In  addition  to  an  improved  safety  profile,  this  is likely to be more cost-effective than existing modalities [23], especially in older patients who experience higher rates of morbidity and mortality following resection [24].\nNumerous  clinical  studies  are  underway  examining multiple novel devices for bronchoscopic tumour ablation, with  a  recently  published  review  summarizing  the  published  evidence  for  individual  modalities  [20].  Radiofrequency ablation and photodynamic therapy remain, prior to this study, the only modalities where bronchoscopic experience in ablation of peripheral tumours in clinical settings has been reported [20]. Studies examining bronchoscopically delivered microwave ablation, bronchoscopic laser interstitial thermal therapy, and cryoablation are limited to preclinical settings. All of these techniques require direct localization of target lesions to ensure accurate delivery of ablative energy, which may limit their utility.\nIn contrast, BTVA is an established technique with a known safety profile following its use in emphysema, and multiple treatments may be delivered within a single procedure [9]. This could be used to ensure treatment zones fully encompass a target lesion. BTVA-C may not necessitate bronchoscopic localization, as treatment need only be  delivered  via  a  'feeding'  airway.  Ablation  zones  are likely  to  be  larger  than  achievable  by  localized  ablative technologies.  Additional  treatments,  perhaps  following intra-procedural  cone-beam  CT  imaging  [17],  may  be possible,  to  ensure  a  margin  around  the  tumour  is  achieved.\nFuture studies are required to optimize lesion targeting and to ensure tumours are encompassed by treatment zones. Efficacy for larger lesions should be established. 'Dose' optimization will also be necessary, and establishing a safety profile in less physiologically robust patients will be required to allow this modality to proceed to definitive 'treat-and-leave' studies. Intriguing translational research suggests that thermal ablation of Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) may up-regulate an antitumour immune response [25, 26], increasing  responsiveness  to  immunotherapy which may also expand the application of BVTA-C, though this requires further study.",

      "content": "BTVA of lung tumours is feasible and well tolerated, with preliminary evidence suggesting high potential for effective ablation of tumours. Thermal injury is well demarcated, and uniform tissue necrosis is observed within ablation zones receiving sufficient thermal dose per volume of lung. Treatment of smaller volumes and ensuring adequate thermal dose may be important for ablative efficacy. Further studies are required to optimize targeting of BTVA-C as well as thermal dose and to establish the impact of intra-tumoural scarring and pleural contact on ablative efficacy of BTVA-C.",
