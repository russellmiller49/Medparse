      "title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "content": "Air leak is one of the most common complications following lung surgery, occurring in up to 20% of cases. 1,2 A multitude of preventive measures are employed intraoperatively including staples, glues, and fissure last surgery. 3-6 Approximately 5-10% of patients continue to have an air leak after 5 days, at which point it is classified as being persistent or prolonged. 7 Prolonged air leaks are the most common cause of extended hospitalizations and can contribute significantly to cost. 8 A prolonged air leak may also develop following spontaneous pneumothorax. Surgery is recommended in the vast majority of patients with spontaneous pneumothorax if an air leak persists for more than a few days following chest tube insertion. Patients with unfavorable anatomy or medical comorbidities that make them high risk for surgery, however, may develop prolonged air leak.\nAn ongoing air leak of any origin typically necessitates continued chest drainage, which may be accomplished using either analog or digital drainage systems. 9,10 A novel digital drainage system was first introduced in 2007. 11 Since then, other models have been developed. 12 These new digital systems have been used to develop standardized algorithms for chest tube management based on objective data. 13\nAnalog drainage systems contain a sequentially numbered series of columns in the water seal chamber. The degree of air leak is assessed by observing the highest numbered column in which bubbling occurs. This provides a qualitative assessment at a specific point in time. The standardized assessment developed by Cerfolio can be used to document air leak severity. 14 This assessment, however, is subject to interobserver variability and does not account for variation over time. Digital drainage systems use electronic sensors to measure changes in pressure and thus may allow for quantification of the degree of air leak continuously and provide a graphical representation of the trend over time. 11 Data on intrapleural pressure are also provided by some units. Together, these data may lead to expedited chest tube removal and hospital discharge with obvious financial implications.\nIt is unclear if digital drainage systems are superior to their analog counterparts in terms of managing post-operative and spontaneous air leaks. Individual studies have been limited by small sample size. Trials have demonstrated decreased chest tube duration and hospital length of stay (LOS) with the digital systems. 8,13,15,16 Two systematic reviews with meta-analysis on the subject have been performed. 17,18 One review only included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), while the other also included observational studies. Both only included postoperative air leaks. To improve generalizability, we included RCTs, cohort studies, and case series of patients with air leaks of either post-surgical or spontaneous pneumothorax origin. In each patient population, we focused on whether use of a digital versus an analog drainage system reduced chest tube duration and hospital LOS.",

This validated tool provides an overall score of study quality based on quality of reporting, external validity, internal validity (based on bias and confounding), and power. The checklist consists of 27 items distributed between five sub-scales: (1) Reporting (10 items, 0-11 points), (2) External validity (3 items, 0-3 points), (3) Bias (7 items, 0-7 points), (4) Confounding (6 items, 0-6 points), and (5) Power (1 item, 0-1 points). Answers were scored 0 or 1, except for one item in the reporting subscale, which scored 0 to 2. The total maximum score is therefore 28.  Score ranges were\nassigned corresponding quality levels as previously reported: excellent (26-28), good (20-25), fair (1519), and poor ( ≤ 14). 21\nOdds ratios (OR), median values, and ranges for summary statistics are reported, when available, based on information provided in each of the original studies.

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "content": "Air leak remains one of the most common complications after pulmonary resections. 1,2 Postoperative air leaks often necessitate extended hospitalization periods and inevitably increase costs. Air leaks may also complicate spontaneous pneumothorax in patients with comorbidities or unfavorable anatomy that precludes surgery. The advent of digital drainage systems over the past decade has the potential to alter the framework of chest tube management. This systematic review demonstrated inconsistent benefits in chest tube duration and hospital LOS with digital drainage systems. In the post-operative setting, 44% of studies identified a statistically significantly shorter chest tube duration with the digital drainage system.  This value increased to 66% in the post-pneumothorax setting.  Hospital LOS was statistically significantly shorter in 42% of studies in the post-operative setting.  This value increased slightly to 50% in the post-pneumothorax population.\nPrior studies have suggested that digital drainage systems permit a shorter chest tube duration and LOS, but definitive conclusions have been limited by small sample size. 8,13,15,16 Only two systematic reviews with metanalysis has been performed for digital drainage systems, and only RCTs and observational studies involving postoperative air leaks were included. 17,18\nThis systematic review of digital drainage systems is the largest to date and is the first to include postpneumothorax air leaks. Our analysis included RCTs, cohort studies, and case series involving both postoperative and post-pneumothorax air leaks in order to improve generalizability and applicability in clinical practice. Prior metanalyses only included RCTs and observation studies. The strength of our conclusions was impacted by the results of our quality index assessment.\nWell defined PICO questions were designed to address these two unique clinical problems. A total of 23 articles are included, and the results are stratified by etiology. Most articles focused on postoperative air leaks, where the digital drainage system sometimes resulted in shorter chest tube duration and shorter hospital LOS. With post-pneumothorax air leak, digital drainage systems resulted in a shorter chest tube duration in two of three studies and a shorter hospital LOS in one of two studies. 33,34\nDigital drainage systems may result in a shorter chest tube duration and hospital LOS for several reasons.  First, by tracking the intrapleural pressure, digital systems may be able to distinguish a true\nair leak from an obligatory space.  Second, by quantifying the degree of air flow over a period of time, providers may feel more comfortable with earlier removal of a chest tube.\nAlthough earlier chest tube removal is an admirable goal, it is only beneficial if re-insertion is not required. Data on chest tube re-insertion rate or pneumothorax recurrence rate were provided in 11 of the 23 studies (Supplement 4).  The rate was not statistically significantly different between the digital and analog drainage groups in the post-operative cohort in any study. In the one study that included these data in the post-pneumothorax group, however, there was a statistically significant difference favoring the digital drainage group (4.4% vs 14.%, p=0.041). 35\nOur study has multiple limitations. First, while its inclusivity improves generalizability, the heterogeneity of the studies precludes metanalysis. Second, numerous factors, such as FEV1, which lobe is resected, and the type of resection (segmentectomy, lobectomy, bi-lobectomy, etc.) impact chest tube duration and hospital LOS.  These variables were selected because they are the most commonly studied variables in the literature on this topic. It is possible, however that changes in chest tube duration and hospital LOS may not be solely attributable to a particular drainage system. Early mobilization is safe and may reduce postoperative complications following pulmonary resection. 45,46 Third, only a limited number of studies include post-pneumothorax patients so the data in this scenario are less robust. Fourth, the LOS metric is potentially problematic because some surgeons will discharge a patient the same day a chest tube is removed, while others will wait until the following day. Some patients may even be discharged with a chest tube in place. Fifth, published data may be skewed by a negative outcomes publication bias.  Thus, studies demonstrating equivocal or inferior outcomes with digital drainage systems may be underrepresented.\nCost effectiveness is an essential concern for an ideal chest drainage system. Our analysis did not address cost effectiveness of the two drainage systems. Cost data for post-operative air leak was provided in three studies. 25,33,36 In two of these studies, there was a statistically significant difference in cost between the digital and analog systems. 38 The digital system resulted in a significant reduction in hospital costs, with average savings of €476 to €751. Data on cost were available in one study involving patients with air leak following spontaneous pneumothorax and also showed significant cost savings. 33 Mean treatment cost was lower by 22.34%, which saved roughly €430 per patient. Given the decrease in chest tube duration and hospital LOS, we suspect that the use of digital systems could be costeffective in the long-term, despite the high initial expenditure. However, the vast majority of patients undergoing lung resection do not develop an air leak, so the use of digital systems in those patients adds cost without benefit. If there is a clear advantage of digital systems in selected patients, the next task is to identify those patients before the more expensive system is selected for drainage and routinely implemented in clinical practice.",
