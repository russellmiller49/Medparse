One such method is the insertion of unidirectional endobronchial valves (EBV) that aim to collapse hyperinflated lung regions by allowing trapped gas to escape from the targeted lobe while preventing gas refill during inhalation.\nIn  the  first  multicenter,  international,  randomized, controlled trial with EBV (Pulmonx, Redwood City, Calif., USA)   [5]  , modest improvements in the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1  )  and the 6-min walk test were observed in patients treated with valves compared to controls. In a subgroup of patients, those with complete fissures on chest CT scans (a surrogate for the absence of interlobar  collaterals)  and  optimal  valve  positioning, however, dramatically improved clinical outcomes were recorded. This group showed a 712-ml reduction in target lobar volume, which was inversely correlated with the increase in FEV 1  . These observations were confirmed by the European cohort of the trial   [6]  , where at 12 months subjects in the EBV group with complete fissure and complete lobar occlusion had a 28 ± 32% improvement in FEV 1 and a 22 ± 40% improvement on the 6-min walk test.\nLike all interventional procedures, however, EBV therapy for emphysema is associated with a number of adverse events, such as postprocedural pneumothorax. This paper recommends an approach to pneumothorax management after valve placement to inform physicians and patients of the risk-benefit profile and to assist them in decision making. A more detailed evaluation of the staging and management of these patients is warranted and outlined below.",

      "title": "Mechanism of Action of Valve Therapy-Related Pneumothorax in Emphysema",
      "content": "Endobronchial one-way valves are designed to be placed unilaterally in the segments of a hyperinflated target lobe that has little or no collateral ventilation (  fig. 1  ). The aim is to induce lobar volume reduction and improve the respiratory mechanics and thereby the underlying clinical symptoms   [7]  . Brown et al.   [8] showed that a part of the volume reduction in the target lobe is redistributed to the ipsilateral lobe, with only a small portion redistributed to the contralateral lung. This result explains why the net reduction in total lung capacity in these patients is modest even with large reductions in the target lobe. In this patient population, the target lobe for volume reduction is usually the one with the most emphysematous destruction and the most severe hyperinflation. The occurrence\nof  a  pneumothorax  following  EBV  therapy  usually  involves  the  untreated  ipsilateral  lobe  and/or  a  collapsed target lobe that is unable to reexpand due to the presence of the one-way valves. It is hypothesized that postprocedurally the untreated ipsilateral lobe expands to occupy the newly created space in the thoracic cavity. The subsequent shifting of volumes on one side of the lung, which could be rapid in some cases, may be associated with tensioning and in some cases tearing of the already compromised lung tissue. The magnitude of the lobar volume shift, i.e. the proportional size of the target lobe reduction that is shifted to the nontreated ipsilateral lobe, might be a greater risk factor for pneumothorax; however, this hypothesis has not yet been formally tested. Rupture of blebs or bullae in the ipsilateral nontreated lobe is considered the most frequent cause of a pneumothorax   [9] (  fig. 2  ). Another mechanism could be parenchymal rupture as the lobes shift volumes due to preexisting pleural adhesion (  fig. 3  ). All of the above conditions describe a pneumothorax  that  may  result  in  a  bronchopleural  fistula  that could  cause  pneumothorax  expansion  over  time  if  not treated by chest tube insertion. Another less common but potential  manifestation  is  pneumothorax  ex  vacuo.  In this  condition,  acute  lobar  collapse  results  in  a  sudden increase in the negative intrapleural pressure surrounding the collapsed lobe (  fig. 4  ). As a result, gas originating\nfrom the ambient tissues and blood are drawn into the pleural  space  surrounding the collapsed lobe while the seal between the visceral and parietal pleura of the adjacent lobe or lobes remains intact   [10]  . In this latter condition, a bronchopleural fistula is not present and the pleural air would resolve spontaneously over time without the need  for  tube  thoracostomy.  Finally,  a  pneumothorax might theoretically also originate from the barotrauma response  to  the  acute  volume  reduction  in  the  treated lobe. The absence of a bronchopleural fistula might be due to the valves closing the originating bronchi. These cases of pneumothorax are expected to be associated with a lower volume on X-ray. A 'wait-and-see' policy might be successful in these patients.",

      "title": "Pneumothorax Rate and Outcomes in Emphysema Patients Treated with Valves",
      "content": "Pneumothorax is a common unintended consequence of numerous thoracic procedures. For example, the estimated risks of a pneumothorax during a CT-guided biopsy are highly variable; published reports range from 4% [11] to 42%   [12]  . In a large observational study   [13] of patients undergoing transthoracic needle lung biopsy of a pulmonary nodule, the risk of any pneumothorax was\n15%, and 6.6% of all biopsies resulted in pneumothorax requiring  a  chest  tube.  Compared  to  patients  without complications,  those  who  experienced  hemorrhage  or pneumothorax requiring a chest tube had longer lengths of hospital stay and were more likely to develop respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Similarly, within 30 days of LVRS, 90% of patients developed air leaks   [14]  . Although the median duration of the air leaks was 7 days, 13% of the patients (66/496) had air leaks lasting 30 days or longer postoperatively   [15]  .\nColor version available online\nThe relationship between atelectasis and postinterventional pneumothorax was demonstrated in a case series of patients  with  emphysema  using  intrabronchial  valves (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan)   [16]  . In that trial the overall incidence of pneumothorax was 12% during a 12-month period. Analysis of those patients who underwent complete  lobar  exclusion  (of  the  left  upper  lobe),  however, revealed  a  pneumothorax  rate  of  29%.  Subsequently, studies using intrabronchial valves were designed to minimize the risk of pneumothorax with incomplete occlusion of the targeted upper lobes   [17]  . This approach resulted in higher safety, with no adverse events attributed\nto pneumothorax, but an overall lower efficacy and only a mild volume reduction of the treated lobe (7 ± 9%).\nIn the VENT trial, the pneumothorax rates within the first 90 days were unremarkable, i.e. 4.2% in the US cohort [5] and 4.5% in the European cohort   [6]  . These low rates are not surprising given that 43.8% of the patients had incomplete lobar  isolation  due  to  suboptimal  valve  placement, and only 33% had complete fissures in the targeted lobes.  Thus,  only  a  small  percentage  of  patients  experienced significant target lobar volume reduction. The introduction of the Chartis pulmonary assessment system (Pulmonx)   [18] enabled real-time assessment of the presence\nof collateral ventilation, and it has shown 75% accuracy in predicting which patients would respond to EBV therapy. Using this tool, there is an increased likelihood of response and the low pneumothorax rate from earlier reports is expected to rise. In fact, the authors of this report observe a pneumothorax rate of up to 30% in patients with lobar exclusion and no collateral ventilation in clinical practice.\nIn the current edition of Respiration, Gompelmann et al.   [19]  , using controlled studies with EBV therapy both with and without use of the Chartis system, describe the occurrence of pneumothoraces that typically developed within the first 90 days of valve insertion. The median onset of a pneumothorax was 2 days after the procedure, with a median duration of 11.5 days. The majority of cases resolved either with observation or with the insertion of a chest tube. Importantly, these patients showed substantial reductions in the target lobar volume (65 ± 36%) at follow-up. This is of particular clinical importance as patients with a greater than 50% reduction in target lobar volume demonstrate clinically significant benefits in hyperinflation, exercise capacity, quality of life, and airflow obstruction   [20]  .  The latter report further indicates results comparable to those of LVRS in these patients, with an expected lower morbidity and mortality. Therefore, in terms of patient outcomes, an approach with complete lobar occlusion and a higher risk of pneumothorax appears to be superior to incomplete lobar occlusion   [21]  .",

      "title": "Pneumothorax Management after Valve Treatment for Emphysema",
      "content": "By definition, patients who are candidates for endoscopic valve therapy have severe emphysema with hyperinflation and impaired gas exchange and exercise capacity. Thus, these patients are less likely to tolerate a pneumothorax  than  patients  with  a  primary  spontaneous pneumothorax.  Skilled  and  aggressive  pneumothorax management is therefore warranted in this patient population and every pneumothorax, in particular a tension pneumothorax, can be life threatening   [16]  . The authors of this report introduce a management recommendation which  is  intended  to  provide  guidance  for  physicians dealing with these cases in clinical practice (  fig. 5  ). By following  these  recommendations,  traumatic  scenarios, prolonged drainage, extended hospital stays, and/or surgery might be avoidable in many cases.\nBased  on  clinical  signs,  symptoms,  and  imaging  results,  the  pneumothorax  is  classified  as  small  or  large (pneumothorax rim size between the lung and chest wall\n<2 cm or ≥ 2 cm, respectively)   [22] and as symptomatic or asymptomatic:\n· If the pneumothorax is small and asymptomatic, clinical observation may be sufficient and a repeat X-ray is recommended within 4 h after the diagnosis and after 24 h (  fig. 6  ).\n· If clinical symptoms deteriorate or the size of the pneumothorax is enlarging, immediate insertion of a chest drain is required. Aspiration is less likely to be successful in patients with emphysema and severe airflow obstruction but can be considered in symptomatic patients  with  small  pneumothoraces  in  an  attempt  to avoid chest drain insertion.\n· The insertion  of  a  small-bore  chest  drain  is  recommended by the British Thoracic Society   [22]  ; however, patients may develop a tension pneumothorax, respiratory failure, and/or massive soft tissue emphysema and a large-bore chest tube may be necessary in these cases (  fig. 7  ).\n· While the diagnosis is usually confirmed on a chest radiograph, a chest CT scan may be necessary in order to  confirm the localization (e.g. interlobar pneumothorax, see   fig. 8  a, b) and/or extent (e.g. complete or partial) of the pneumothorax. Furthermore, a CT scan is  recommended  to  guide  treatment  options  and/or rule out aberrant chest tube placement.\n· General measures: oxygen is indicated but caution is required  for  patients  with  carbon  dioxide  retention [22]  . In addition, physicians should make sure that patients receive appropriate bronchodilator therapy and consider  systemic  steroid  and  antibiotic  therapy  (a treatment course of 5-7 days is recommended).\nAs the pneumothorax usually occurs in the untreated ipsilateral lobe, the decision of whether or not to remove one or all of the inserted valves must be made, as the chest drain and suction cannot inflate the treated lobe due to the presence of the valves. This decision must be made taking the clinical symptoms, the amount of air leak vol-\nume, and the existence or absence of soft tissue emphysema into account:\n· Removing one or more valves might return the target lobe to its (hyperinflated) pretreatment state and promote pneumothorax healing by reestablishing pleural contact. The lack of full expansion and pleural sealing of the untreated lobe might, however, also be due to endobronchial  mucus  plugging  requiring  bronchoscopic suction.\n· If the air leak stops after valve removal and does not reappear after discontinuation of the chest drain, valve replacement can be considered 6-8 weeks after chest tube removal. This recommendation is based on the data presented by Gompelman et al.   [19]  , in which patients  with  a  pneumothorax  experienced  substantial functional improvements. However, despite evidence of  atelectasis  and  subsequent  pneumothorax  after valve treatment, the initial volume reduction may disappear after pneumothorax resolution. In these cases, repeat bronchoscopy to check for proper valve placement  may  be  recommendable.  If  the  valves  are  in proper placement, no further action is required and the patient needs to be informed about the potential risk of a repeat pneumothorax.\n· The likelihood of a repeat pneumothorax appears to be very low in clinical practice, most likely due to pleural adhesion after the first occurrence; however, there is no scientific data to support this hypothesis.",

      "title": "Prolonged Air Leakage after Pneumothorax",
      "content": "In cases with a persistent air leak for at least 1 week despite  valve  removal,  the  following  treatment  options for a prolonged air leak need to be considered: mechanical or chemical pleurodesis, use of a Heimlich valve, or surgery.  The  timing  and  choice  of  the  therapeutic  approach may largely depend on the patient's condition and the  experience  with  and  availability  of  these  treatment options at the respective institution. In patients with severe  heterogeneous  emphysema,  the  surgical  approach might be conducted with the intent of volume reduction, though  high  rates  of  cardiopulmonary  morbidity  and mortality need to be taken into consideration   [23]  .\nThe majority of patients with a valve-associated pneumothorax, however, do not require surgical interventions and can be safely treated with a chest tube with or without a Heimlich valve in the presence of a prolonged air leak.\nNotably, recent case series have demonstrated the efficacy of valve insertion in reducing and eliminating air\nleaks   [24, 25]  . Thus, valve insertion in targeted airways leading to the region of parenchymal air leakage might be a potential alternative treatment approach if isolation of the 'responsible' airways is feasible.",

      "title": "Postprocedural Detection of Pneumothorax",
      "content": "A chest X-ray examination is strongly recommended within the first 4 h and then 24 h after the procedure as routine clinical practice. As the majority of pneumothoraces following valve placement occur within 48 h   [19]  , the authors of this report recommend that patients stay in hospital for at least 2 nights after the procedure for surveillance. It has to be acknowledged, however, that institutional  practices  may  substantially  vary  and  patients might be discharged earlier if stable after the procedure. Thus,  importantly,  physicians  should  inform  their  patients of the potential risk of a pneumothorax after discharge, the symptoms to be aware of, and the information to provide to emergency responders. Patients requiring air travel immediately after discharge might require a longer period of postprocedural observation (up to 5 days).\nA  late  occurrence  of  pneumothorax,  i.e.  after  discharge, could be especially serious depending on the patient's circumstances and the clinical development of the pneumothorax. Since the valves cause gradual shrinkage of the treated lobe and thereafter only maintain the collapse,  they  may not increase the risk of pneumothorax when the process of lobar volume shift has been completed. Hence, a pneumothorax occurring 3 months after endoscopic  valve  therapy  is  less  likely  to  be  due  to  valve placement. There is limited experience in this category; however, any pneumothorax in patients with emphysema and limited respiratory reserves needs to be considered an  emergency  and  patients  should  be  informed  of  the need to seek medical help when presenting with any signs or symptoms of a pneumothorax regardless of the timing of valve therapy. Ideally, written information sheets with details of the signs and symptoms of a pneumothorax and guidance on how and when to seek medical help should be provided.",
