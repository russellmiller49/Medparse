Informed consent or a waiver of consent was obtained in accordance with institutional guidelines. Data were entered through the AQuIRE Web-based interface using standardized defi  nitions, quality control checks, and protocols as previously described. 19\nInformation extracted from AQuIRE included patient demographics, clinical characteristics, physician and hospital information, sedation information, procedural information, pathology results, complications, and outcomes of complications. The use of rapid onsite cytologic evaluation (ROSE) was recorded, but the results of the onsite reading were not entered; only the fi  nal reading by the pathologist was recorded.\nThe primary outcome was procedural morbidity, defi  ned as any of the following events within 24 h: bleeding that required additional intervention, pneumothorax, clinically signifi  cant airway injury (defi  ned as airway injury requiring either escalation of care or additional intervention), sustained hypoxia (defi  ned as oxygen saturation , 90% for . 1 min), hypotension, cardiac arrest, arrhythmia, or respiratory failure requiring positive pressure ventilation. Secondary outcomes were the clinical consequences of complications as measured by the need for an escalation in level of care, the need for further interventions to manage these complications, or death. An escalation in level of care was defi  ned as admission to the hospital if the patient was an outpatient or transfer to the ICU if the patient was an inpatient.\nCategorical data were compared using the Fisher exact test. Stratifi  ed analysis was done using the Cochrane Mantel-Haenszel test. Logistic regression was used to examine the association of outcomes with patient and clinical characteristics. Hierarchical models, with patients nested within hospitals, were compared with ordinary logistic regression models by removing the hospital variance component. Hospital experience was modeled by using annual hospital volume of TBNA procedures as a hospital-level variable; all other variables were considered patient-level variables. We decided a priori that variables with P ≤ .20 on univariate analysis would be candidate variables for the multivariate models. A backward elimination strategy was used, and factors were retained if P , .05. P , .05  was  considered signifi  cant;  all  tests  were  two sided.

Hospital-specifi  c 24-h complication rates ranged from 0.50% to 3.26% ( P 5 .37) (e-Table 1). Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that only TBBx was associated with an increased risk of complications, which occurred in 3.21% of patients who underwent TBBx compared with 1.15% of those who\nthe hilar nodes, and one randomized trial found EBUSTBNA to be superior to mediastinoscopy for lung cancer staging. 12  As a result, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA is becoming widely adopted as the standard of care for sampling mediastinal lymph nodes.\nAlthough the initial studies of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA focused on evaluating diagnostic performance, many of these studies conducted at centers of excellence also reported impressively low complication rates. 6,11-17  Whether these results can be generalized to everyday clinical practice is unknown because the study sample sizes were too small for a formal analysis of complications. Additional outcomes data on Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA complications in everyday clinical practice are, therefore, needed to establish benchmarks for quality improvement and clinical effectiveness.\nBronchoscopy registries are well suited for this purpose because they provide a more generalized snapshot of outcomes and clinical effectiveness than do clinical trials, which by their nature are more selective and not necessarily refl  ective of everyday practice. 13,18,19 We used the American College of Chest Physicians Quality Improvement Registry, Evaluation, and Education (AQuIRE) program to evaluate Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA complications, their clinical consequences, and the relationship between complications and practice patterns. The primary objective was to quantify the incidence of and risk factors for complications in patients undergoing Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA. The secondary objectives were to quantify the incidence and risk factors for pneumothorax, to evaluate the consequences of complications as measured by escalation in the level of care, and to assess differences in complication rates among hospitals and the impact of practice pattern variations, such as the use of transbronchial biopsy (TBBx).\nManuscript  received  February  28,  2012;  revision  accepted September 18, 2012.\nAffi  liations: From the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Drs Eapen, Lei, Jimenez, Morice, Sarkiss, Rice, and Ost), Houston, TX; Kaiser Permanente South Sacramento (Dr Shah), Sacramento, CA; Johns Hopkins Hospital (Dr Yarmus), Baltimore, MD; Kaiser Permanente Sunnyside Medical Center (Dr Filner), Clackamas, OR; Henry Ford Hospital (Dr Ray), Detroit, MI; Yale School of Medicine (Dr Michaud), New Haven, CT; Chicago Chest Center (Dr Greenhill), Elk Grove, IL; and Baylor College of Medicine (Dr Casal), Houston, TX.\nFunding/Support: This research was supported in part by the National Institutes of Health through a Cancer Center Support Grant [CA016672] to The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center  .

The use of ROSE for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was associated with less use of TBBx, which was performed in 12.6% of patients when ROSE was used compared with 19.1% of patients when ROSE was not used ( P 5 .006), indicating that one TBBx was avoided for each 16 ROSEs performed (e-Tables 4, 5).\nThe effect of ROSE on TBBx use depended on whether a specifi  c diagnosis was made by EBUSTBNA (Mantel-Haenszel P 5 .049). Among patients for whom a specifi  c diagnosis was made by Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, TBBx was performed in 6.4% when ROSE was used compared with 14.8% when ROSE was not used (Odds ratio (OR), 0.39; 95% CI, 0.22-0.70; P 5 .001).

In contrast to diagnostic yield, 19  there was less variance among hospitals in terms of safety. There was signifi  cant interhospital variation in the use of ROSE as well as TBBx with Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA. This fi  nding is important because\nData are presented as No. (%). See Table 1 for expansion of abbreviation. a\nThe present fi  ndings are directly relevant to the ongoing debate over sedation techniques for EBUSTBNA.  19,35-38   Currently,  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA is routinely performed under moderate sedation or general anesthesia, depending on local preferences and resources. Advocates of moderate sedation frequently cite the lower risk of complications, particularly pneumothorax, as a potential benefi  t. 38  Advocates of deep sedation or general anesthesia cite patient comfort, ability to sam  ple more lymph node stations, higher diagnostic yield, and educational benefi  ts for trainees as potential advantages. 19  However, few data confi  rm or refute most of these claims. In general, use of deep or general anesthesia was associated with a longer bronchoscopy time and procedure time, but these did not affect the incidence of complications. The longer bronchoscopy and procedure time associated with general anesthesia may be refl  ective of procedure planning where full mediastinal staging may skew the bronchoscopist toward requesting anesthesia support, whereas a single-station diagnostic Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA is more likely to be done under moderate sedation. The present fi  ndings suggest that the type of sedation and the method of ventilation do not affect the incidence of complications in patients without preexisting lung injury. However, when complications do occur, the consequence may be more serious and require an escalation in level of care for patients with limited physiologic reserve. It is important to recognize, however, that the absolute risks of both complications and escalation in care from complications are very low. Overall, the 1.44% incidence of complications demonstrates the safety of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA and should encourage wider adoption of this technology.\nWe found no other patient-level predictors of complications. TBNA of high paratracheal lymph nodes (2R and 2L) has been anecdotally reported to be associated with increased risk of pneumothorax, but in this study, there was no association. Similarly, smaller lymph nodes and trainee involvement in the procedure did not affect outcomes. These fi  ndings support the standard use of complete mediastinal lymph node staging for non-small cell lung cancer with Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) regardless of lymph node size or location because previous reports suggested that sampling more lymph nodes is associated with an increase in diagnostic yield. 39\nThis study adds to the growing body of evidence evaluating the impact of hospital variables on bronchoscopic  outcomes.  In  contrast  to  the  previous AQuIRE report on diagnostic yield, 19  hospital volume was not associated with any differences in complication rates.\nWe  did  identify  wide interhospital variations in the use of ROSE and the frequency of concurrent TBBx. Of course, in a registry study, it is impossible\ncame from concurrent TBBx procedures rather than from the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA itself. TBBx was performed under fl  uoroscopy in most cases, but this was left to the individual centers. Because the rate of TBBx and associated pneumothorax was low, no signifi  cant difference could be ascertained regarding the impact of fl  uoroscopy. The incidence of pneumothorax when TBBxs were performed in addition to Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was 2.7%, which is similar to previous reports. 13,26-32 However, in contrast to previous investigations, 33,34 we found that the use of positive pressure ventilation in patients undergoing TBBx was not associated with increased pneumothorax risk. This contrast likely refl  ects differences in patient populations; previous studies included patients receiving positive pressure ventilation for respiratory failure, whereas patients in this study received positive pressure ventilation only for the procedure. The difference in complications between these patient populations suggests that there is an interaction among lung injury, positive pressure ventilation, and pneumothorax when TBBx is performed. The results of the present study suggest that positive pressure ventilation during TBBx is low risk in the absence of acute lung injury.\nThe present study is one of a few that evaluated the consequences of the complications associated with Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS). Although physiologic status, comorbidities, anesthesia, and hospital variables may not affect the frequency of complications, they do affect the consequences of complications, as refl  ected by the need for an escalation in level of care. Older age, inpatient status, and the use of deep sedation or general anesthesia were all associated with an increased probability of escalation of care. These factors probably refl  ect  decreased physiologic reserve and become relevant only when a complication occurs, meaning that they have an impact on the consequences of complications, not the incidence  . It is probable that other factors are also relevant, such as comorbidities and functional status, although the low frequency of complications limited our ability to demonstrate the effect of these variables, which did not reach statistical signifi  cance.\nwith Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA are so rare that the power of the study to identify particular risk factors is limited. Thus, the single reported death could not be analyzed meaningfully, but it reminds us that even a procedure as safe as Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA can be associated with catastrophic complications. In addition, because AQuIRE includes only complications occurring within 24 h, late complications such as infections, which have rarely been reported, would have been missed. 48-50  AQuIRE is still relatively small, and most of the data are from major academic centers. The safety profi  le, therefore, is more refl  ective of highly experienced centers, suggesting that efforts should be made to enroll additional centers from a variety of practice settings. It will be important to revisit the data when more centers are included.\nIn conclusion, this report from the AQuIRE registry represents the fi  rst multicenter prospective observational study to evaluate patient and hospital predictors of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA complications. The only patient variable that affected the incidence of complications was concurrent TBBx. When complications did occur, escalations in level of care were more likely to be required in older patients, inpatients, and patients who received deep sedation or general anesthesia. The use of ROSE was associated with a reduced use of TBBx, but there was signifi  cant interhospital variation in the use of ROSE and TBBx. Future studies should expand this registry to other hospitals of varying sizes and more diverse practice patterns to verify these fi  ndings and to explore the interactions between hospital-level and physician-level variations on complications and their consequences.",

From the data available, we demonstrated that TBBx was more frequently performed when ROSE was not available. Previous studies of ROSE in bronchoscopy have focused primarily on the ability of ROSE to decrease the percentage of cases with inadequate specimens. 40-45  Those studies often included mixed populations, including patients with parenchymal lesions as well as patients with mediastinal lesions, and focused on conventional TBNA rather than on Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA.  41  However, few studies have looked at the impact of ROSE with EBUSTBNA on use of TBBx. One single-center randomized controlled trial using conventional TBNA found that  ROSE  reduced  the  number  of  parenchymal biopsies and complications (most of which consisted of minor bleeding). 40  The investigators speculated that the impact of ROSE on diagnostic adequacy might decrease as Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA replaces conventional TBNA.  40  A second study found only a trend in favor of a reduced need for biopsies with ROSE. 46  The present fi  nding that the use of ROSE with EBUSTBNA can help to limit the number of TBBxs is consistent with and builds on the work of these previous investigators. 40-46\nWe found that TBBx use varied signifi  cantly among hospitals ( P , .001). Although variations in disease prevalence among hospitals are certainly possible, TBBx use varied even in cases when ROSE was used and a diagnosis was established through Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, suggesting that the quality of ROSE was a factor. This suggestion is further supported by the fi  nding that a fi  nal diagnosis of sarcoidosis was associated with a higher probability of TBBx ( P 5 .003) because it is far more diffi  cult to identify granulomas than cancer on Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA.  6\nThe present fi  ndings also highlight the value of registry data as a quality improvement tool. Measurement of outcomes is a necessary element for all quality improvement programs. 47  Registry data can provide direct feedback to participants about their performance regarding not only diagnostic yield and complications but also the impact of their processes (eg, use of ROSE) and structures (eg, availability, organization, quality of ROSE) on outcomes.\nOne of the strengths of AQuIRE is that data are collected prospectively from multiple hospitals and physicians. The data, therefore, are more generalizable than that from prior single-center clinical trials, 40,46 and the insights gained can be viewed as complementary to those obtained from randomized trials.\nAlthough these fi  ndings are useful, it is important to recognize their limitations.
