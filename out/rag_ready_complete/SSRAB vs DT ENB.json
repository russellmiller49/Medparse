Diagnostic yield was 77% for ssRAB (110 of 143 PPLs) and 80% (158 of 197 PPLs) for DT-ENB (OR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.5-1.4; P = .4). Median lesion diameters were 17 and 19 mm, respectively.

Digital tomosynthesis uses a standard C-arm /uniFB02 uoroscope to produce an intraprocedural three-dimensional image of the target lesion, allowing its location to be updated in the ENB targeting system. DT-ENB (superDimension; Medtronic) was introduced in February 2018 and has been reported to improve the diagnostic yield substantially over conventional ENB without DT. 8-10\nThe Food and Drug Administration recently approved two robotic-assisted navigational bronchoscopy platforms. These systems, in which the bronchoscopist controls the insertion and articulation of a robotic bronchoscope with a controller or console near the patient, offer improved stability and visualization into more distal airways than standard bronchoscopes. One of these systems, the ION endoluminal platform (Intuitive Surgical, Inc.), uses a novel shape-sensing technology to track the position of its catheter, referred to as shape-sensing robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (ssRAB). Initial studies suggest ssRAB has a diagnostic yield of approximately 80%. 11,12 However, it currently does not offer near-real-time PPL localization for correction of CT scan-body divergence.\nData comparing ssRAB and DT-ENB are needed. Existing studies are noncomparative, use different diagnostic yield de /uniFB01 nitions, and include different patient populations, hindering comparisons across studies. 8-10,12-15 Speci /uniFB01 cally, as of June 2022, only four studies with > 30 patients reported on robotic-assisted bronchoscopy diagnostic yield, all using different yield de /uniFB01 nitions, limiting comparisons across studies. 12-15 Nonetheless, enthusiasm for these new technologies rapidly has outpaced available evidence, and these platforms increasingly are adopted in clinical practice. Comparative effectiveness data on the relative performance of these systems are needed urgently to provide crucial insight into optimal invasive sampling methods to inform patient care and hospital system capital investments. We hypothesized that the diagnostic yield of ssRAB and DT-ENB platforms for PPLs would be similar.",

All procedures were conducted in a dedicated bronchoscopy operating room under general anesthesia provided by a certi /uniFB01 ed registered nurse anesthetist supervised by an anesthesiologist. Anesthetic care in all procedures consisted of total IV anesthesia with neuromuscular blockade, endotracheal intubation with an 8.5-mm endotracheal tube, a recruitment maneuver (40 cm H2O pressure for 40 s) immediately after intubation followed by application of positive end-expiratory pressure of 15 cm H2O throughout the procedure and minimization of the FIO 2 to limit atelectasis while maintaining oxygen saturation of at least 90%.\nDT-ENB procedures were performed as described previously. 8,9 For ssRAB, planning based on a preprocedure CT scan of the chest was performed in PlanPoint (Intuitive Surgical). After an initial airway inspection and clearance of any secretions using a standard /uniFB02 exible bronchoscope (BF-Q190; Olympus), the ssRAB arm was docked to the endotracheal tube and the robotic catheter with a vision probe was inserted into the airway. Registration was performed by maneuvering through airways in all lobes. After navigation to the target PPL, the vision probe was removed to permit a biopsy.\nRadial endobronchial ultrasonography (UM-S20-17S; Olympus) was used in all patients for both platforms, and all biopsies were performed under /uniFB02 uoroscopic guidance (GE 9800 or OEC 9900 Elite; GE Healthcare System). Transbronchial needle aspiration was the initial biopsy method in all patients using the 21-gauge Arcpoint pulmonary needle (Medtronic) in DT-ENB procedures and 19-gauge, 21-gauge, or 23-gauge Flexision needles (Ion; Intuitive Surgical, Inc.) in ssRAB procedures. Initial passes were submitted for rapid on-site\ncytologic examination (ROSE) in all cases. Additional sampling methods (forceps, cytology brush, focused peripheral wash) were performed after transbronchial needle aspiration at the operator ' s discretion.\nProcedural data and complications were recorded prospectively. Final cytologic and surgical pathologic results and delayed complications were recorded 1 week after each procedure.",

A total of 197 PPLs were biopsied in 170 patients with DTENB and 143 PPLs were biopsied in 133 patients with ssRAB in the 6 months after each was introduced. An additional 22 nodules biopsied in the latter 6-month window using DT-ENB instead of ssRAB as part of a randomized controlled trial requiring DT-ENB (VERITAS; NCT04250194) were excluded.\nDT-ENB and ssRAB groups were well balanced regarding most demographic and radiographic features (Table 1, 2). The median size of lesions biopsied in the DT-ENB and ssRAB cohorts were similar, at 19 mm (interquartile range, 14-28 mm) vs 17 mm (interquartile range, 12-27 mm), respectively. The size range of lesions biopsied via ssRAB was 0.5 to 7.9 cm (28 of 143 lesions were $ 3 cm) and 0.6 to 9.1 cm for DT-ENB (40 of 197 lesions were $ 3 cm). More women (59.4% vs 45.1%; P ¼ . 013) were in the DT-ENB group compared with the\nssRAB group and more nodules were located in the peripheral one-third of the lung in the DT-ENB group (67% [132 of 197]) compared with the ssRAB group (48% [69 of 143]; P < . 001). Nodule densities and prevalence of bronchus signs were similar between groups (Table 2).\nThe primary outcome of diagnostic yield was similar with ssRAB (77% [110 of 143]) and DT-ENB (80% [158 of 197]; Odds ratio (OR), 0.8; 95% CI, 0.5-1.4; P ¼ . 4) (Table 3).

Among patients undergoing ssRAB, 55% of PPLs (78 of 143) were malignant and 22% of PPLs (32 of 143) showed speci /uniFB01 c benign histopathologic features (Table 3). A multivariate logistic regression analysis of the primary outcome adjusting for nodule size, presence of bronchus sign, peripheral one-third vs middle one-third location, and sex did not differ from the unadjusted analysis (Odds ratio (OR), 0.87; 95% CI, 0.49-1.6; P ¼ . 6). In a post hoc sensitivity analysis including only the /uniFB01 rst nodule biopsied per patient, the diagnostic yield was similar with ssRAB (80% [106 of 133]) and DT-ENB (81% [138 of 170]; Odds ratio (OR), 0.9; 95% CI, 0.5 -1.6; P ¼ . 7); multivariate logistic regression adjusting for the same factors listed above did not differ from the unadjusted sensitivity analysis (Odds ratio (OR), 1.0; 95% CI, 0.5-1.8; P ¼ . 9).\nThe overall diagnostic yield (including PPLs biopsied by both platforms) was affected positively by nodule size, concentric radial endobronchial ultrasonography image acquisition, and solid nodule density (Table 4).

      "content": "In this comparative cohort study of prospectively collected data, no difference was found in diagnostic yield between ssRAB and DT-ENB. This is the /uniFB01 rst study that permitted a meaningful comparison of the diagnostic performance of these two novel platforms given similar cohorts drawn from the same patient population with the same operators performing procedures within the same 6-month window from platform introduction using the same conservative de /uniFB01 nition of diagnostic yield. No signi /uniFB01 cant difference remained between platforms after adjustment for possible confounders, including PPL size, presence of a bronchus sign, location in the peripheral one-third of the lung, and sex.\nExisting literature suggests that the diagnostic yield of ENB ranges from 47% to 94%, whereas studies to date on robotic-assisted bronchoscopy have reported diagnostic yields ranging from 69% to 86%. 8-10,12-15,19 -21 Despite these and many additional studies reporting on the diagnostic performance of various technologies to biopsy PPLs, no unifying de /uniFB01 nition of diagnostic yield\nData are presented as No. (%) or mean /C6 SD, unless otherwise indicated.

However, many studies have not required speci /uniFB01 c /uniFB01 ndings to be present to declare a biopsy diagnostic. NAVIGATE, for example, considered any biopsy results not diagnostic of malignancy (including a /uniFB01 nding of normal lung tissue, clearly indicating an inadequate sampling of a PPL) to be diagnostic (true negative) if the lesion regressed over time. 19 The de /uniFB01 nitions used in Robotic Bronchoscopy for Peripheral Pulmonary Lesions: A Multicenter Pilot and Feasibility Study (BENEFIT) 15 and the study by Kalchiem-Dekel 12 of ssRAB considered nonspeci /uniFB01 c\nin /uniFB02 ammation with subsequent regression (BENEFIT) or regression or stability for 12 months (the latter study) to be diagnostic, whereas biopsy results of only normal lung or airway were not, representing a middle ground between the AQuIRE and Clinical Evaluation of superDimension Navigation System for Electromagnetic Navigation Bronchoscopy (NAVIGATE) de /uniFB01 nitions. Overall, these divergent de /uniFB01 nitions result in incommensurable study results.\nAdditional factors beyond diagnostic yield de /uniFB01 nitions, including varying cancer prevalence and biases inherent in retrospective single-center investigations, also introduce variability and limit generalizability and comparisons across studies. Such concerns motivated the current study, in which the same conservative diagnostic yield de /uniFB01 nition is used across all procedures performed. Other sources of interstudy variation, including variable operator experience with a given platform and institutional difference, were minimized by the design of the current work. Although this limits the generalizability of the diagnostic yield estimates presented, it also controls for these other relevant\nData are presented as No. (%) or median (interquartile range), unless otherwise indicated.

The false negative case was organizing pneumonia, which was later found to be lymphoma.\nb Additional speci /uniFB01 c benign diagnoses established by DT-ENB: respiratory bronchiolitis (n ¼ 1), /uniFB01 broelastotic scar (n ¼ 3), organizing /uniFB01 brin with atypical stromal cells consistent with radiation effect (n ¼ 1), and hamartoma (n ¼ 2).

This high yield despite the lack of integrated three-dimensional intraprocedural imaging might be the result of enhanced stability, visualbased navigation through the peripheral airways guided by accurate shape-sensing navigational technology, and the ability to adjust catheter articulation /uniFB01 nely during target lesion biopsy. Digital tomosynthesis integration with ENB was shown in prior work to increase the diagnostic yield from 54% to 79%, 8 and preliminary data on the combination of ssRAB with other real-time intraprocedural 3D imaging methods report higher diagnostic yields of 86% to 93% (using cone-beam CT scan imaging and three-dimensional /uniFB02 uoroscopy, respectively), suggesting that digital tomosynthesis integration with ssRAB may improve yields further. 13,23 Conversely, DT-ENB diagnostic yields may improve further with articulating catheters instead of current catheters with /uniFB01 xed distal curvatures.\nThis study has several limitations. It is derived from a single high-volume center where navigational bronchoscopy is performed or supervised by experienced interventional pulmonologists, which may limit the generalizability of our /uniFB01 ndings. However, as discussed previously, this design also allows for a more reliable comparison of the technical aspects of ssRAB and DT-ENB. As in all nonrandomized studies, unbalanced unmeasured confounders between groups may have biased the results presented, although logistic regression was used to adjust for known confounders and prospective collection of all data reduced the risk of bias during data abstraction. Some baseline differences\nwere found between study groups (sex, proportion of PPLs in the peripheral one-third of the lung), adjustments for which did not change the primary outcome. It is possible some of the difference in PPL proportion in the outer one-third of the lung was the result of inconsistent classi /uniFB01 cation in the absence of formal radiologic segmentation. Finally, we report diagnostic performance using diagnostic yield, rather than diagnostic accuracy, the latter of which requires a prolonged follow-up period to ensure that speci /uniFB01 c benign /uniFB01 ndings in fact were true-negative (benign) nodules. In the DT-ENB cohort for which complete 2year follow-up is available, only 1 of 51 nodules (1.9%) with speci /uniFB01 c benign pathologic features ultimately was determined to be malignant, suggesting that this conservative de /uniFB01 nition of yield used in both cohorts is unlikely to deviate signi /uniFB01 cantly from diagnostic accuracy.",
