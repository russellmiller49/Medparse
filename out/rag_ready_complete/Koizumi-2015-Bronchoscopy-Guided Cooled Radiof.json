The electrode catheters were attached to a monopolar radiofrequency generator (Shinshu University). Tissue impedance  was  monitored  continuously  by  the  generator,  and  an impedance-controlled radiofrequency algorithm was used. During the RFA procedure, a thermometer embedded within the electrode  catheter  tip  continuously  measured  the  temperature.  The output power of the monopolar radiofrequency generator and the upper limit of temperature were set at 20 W and 60 ° C until Sep-\ntember 2009, and then at 30 W and 70 ° C, respectively. Grounding was  achieved  by  attaching  standard  steel  mesh  dispersive  electrodes to the patient's abdomen. A peristaltic pump (Shinshu University) was used to infuse cold water (4 ° C) into the internal lumen of the electrode catheter at 50 ml/min to avoid the pop phenomenon in which coagulated necrotic tissue is formed around the electrode tip and tissue impedance increases rapidly. The cooled RFA enables a greater power output for a longer time compared with standard noncooled RFA, resulting in a larger area of coagulation necrosis due to the ablation effect reaching deeper and wider areas. RFA was continued for 50 s under spontaneous breathing. When the desired power output could not be applied as a result of the increase in impedance due to tissue boiling, the generator automatically switched off the electrode. Current pulsing was also performed manually to avoid charring of local tissue caused by the rapid increase in impedance, which limited further heat diffusion.",

      "content": "We report our clinical experience of CT-guided bronchoscopy  cooled  RFA  for  medically  inoperable  stage  I Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (T1-2aN0M0). The local control rate after the RFA was 82.6%, and the 5-year survival was 61.5%. Based on the review by Bilal et al.   [11]  , the 5-year survival rate in early stage medically inoperable Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was 47% with SBRT and 20.1-27% with percutaneous RFA therapy, respectively. Palma et al.   [8] also described 28% of the 5-year survival rate in stage I Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with GOLD III-IV Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) when treated with SBRT. Clinical outcomes in the present study do not appear to be inferior to those reports   [7-12]  . Although CT-guided bronchoscopy cooled RFA is indicated only in highly selected subjects, our trial indicated that  this  is  a  safe  and  useful  therapeutic  approach  for medically inoperable patients with stage I Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This is the first report showing clinical efficacy of bronchoscopyguided cooled RFA.\nRFA is suitable for use on lung tumor because the radiofrequency energy to a tumor relies on the insulation effect by the existence of normal surrounding lungs   [18]  . It is well known that percutaneous RFA has found clinical applications for medically inoperable patients with lung tumors with good reported results   [19, 20]  . Since the electrode is placed percutaneously directly into the tumor under cross-sectional imaging guidance such as chest CT, pneumothorax requiring a placement of a chest catheter occurs with frequency   [19, 20]  . As an alternative therapy to percutaneously guided RFA, SBRT has been applied for medically inoperable lung tumors. Even in SBRT, half of the patients received SBRT reported to have grade 1-2 radiation pneumonitis   [13]  . SBRT pulmonary complications include radiation pneumonitis, bacterial pneumonia, or atelectasis over grade 3   [8, 10]  . The pneumothorax in  percutaneous RFA and pulmonary complications in SBRT  are  certainly  undesirable  adverse  events  for  patients with respiratory impairment. In the present study,\nthere  were  several  patients  with  impaired  pulmonary function including Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), postthoracic surgery or prior pleuritis, etc. However, no major complications, such as bronchial  bleeding  or  pneumothorax,  were  observed. Thus, CT-guided bronchoscopy cooled RFA could avoid or minimize injury to lung tissues and is suitable for use in  patients  with  medical  comorbidities,  especially  impaired pulmonary function.\nIn our series, retreatment by CT-guided bronchoscopy cooled RFA was performed in 5 progressive lesions. The repeat attempts could be applied in certain cases. We emphasize that safety and repeatability are the greatest advantage  of  our  cooled  electrode-using  bronchoscopy. When pretreatment is necessary, it is important to evaluate regional lymph node involvement or distant metastasis, since the goal of this approach was only focused on local control of the primary lesion in patients without distant and/or regional lymph node metastasis.\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may be an important comorbidity in patients with medically inoperable early Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Severe Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) increases the risk of postoperative complications and reduces the extent of the lung that can be safely resected [21-23]  . In studies focusing on resected patients with early Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), coexisting Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was associated with poorer survival outcome in comparison to those without Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [23, 24]  . In addition, it is well known that the prevalence rates of lung cancer and Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) increase with age   [21, 25]  . Furthermore,  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  is  an  independent  risk  factor  for lung cancer, and an inverse correlation between the degree of airflow obstruction and lung cancer risk was clearly demonstrated   [26]  . Thus, aging of the population will likely be accompanied by an increase in the number of patients with a high risk of postoperative complications and/or unsuitable for surgical treatment in the field of lung cancer. In these clinical situations, our approach using bronchoscopy-guided cooled RFA provides clinical benefits in certain selected patients among medically inoperable patients with early stage Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).\nWe encountered 2 patients who developed chest pain during  the  RFA  procedure.  We  speculated  that  these symptoms were related to the location of the catheter in the peripheral target tumor near the pleura. In addition, as shown in   figure 4  , 3 patients showed enlarged consolidation in the ablated lesion just after bronchoscopy-guided cooled RFA. We believe that the response is reflected as acute ablation-induced inflammation. Three patients were treated with a generator power of 30 W and a temperature of 70 ° C. We have previously shown that the size of the ablated area could be affected by the ablation time [16]  , but the relationship between the response and tem-\nperature  or  power  remains  unclear.  Further  trials  are needed  to  achieve  more  suitable  and  appropriate  RFA conditions.\nThe efficacy of CT-guided bronchoscopy cooled RFA is dependent on the location of the nearest bronchus to the target tumor on CT findings, especially thin-slice CT. Indeed, CT-guided bronchoscopy for diagnosis was performed in each patient, and all patients enrolled in the present study were histologically diagnosed with Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The location of the probe within the tumor on CT images was carefully evaluated at diagnosis. Several investigators indicated that the bronchus sign identified on CT scan was important for the endobronchial approach   [27, 28]  . The bronchus sign is related to the rate of navigation success and the diagnosis of peripheral nodules. We believe that this sign on thin-slice CT is a key variable as an indication  for  our  CT-guided  bronchoscopy  cooled  RFA therapy. Conversely, we speculate that peripheral tumors without an endobronchial route, such as metastatic tumors,  are  unsuitable  for  bronchoscopy-guided  cooled RFA.\nThe difficulty in the accurate response evaluation after bronchoscopy-guided cooled RFA may be a clinical concern. We used RECIST criteria for evaluation in the pres-\nent study, because scant changes on CT images after RFA could correspond to partial response in RESIST criteria. However, the remaining opacity on chest CT after RFA may include viable malignant cells and RFA-induced inflammation, necrosis or fibrosis.  Thus,  it  is  difficult  to distinguish remaining viable tissue from the ablated area after RFA therapy, which was similar to the problems in percutaneous RFA or SBRT   [29]  . Thus, serial CT findings during follow-up may only be available to provide information regarding the response or local progression after RFA.\nIn conclusion, CT-guided bronchoscopy cooled RFA is a safe and effective procedure that could become a useful therapeutic tool for local control in medically inoperable patients with stage I Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This technique could be an alternative strategy, especially in patients with the bronchus sign on CT findings.",
