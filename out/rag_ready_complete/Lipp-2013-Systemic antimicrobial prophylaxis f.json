    "abstract": "Background Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is a surgical procedure performed to maintain nutrition in the short- or long-term. During the procedure, a feeding tube that delivers either a liquid diet, or medication, via a clean or sterile delivery system, is placed surgically through the anterior abdominal wall. Those undergoing PEG tube placement are often vulnerable to infection because of age, compromised nutritional intake, immunosuppression, or underlying disease processes such as malignancy and diabetes mellitus. The increasing incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) contributes both an additional risk to the placement procedure, and to the debate surrounding antibiotic prophylaxis for PEG tube placement. The aim of surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis is to establish a bactericidal concentration of an antimicrobial drug in the patient's serum and tissues, via a brief course of an appropriate agent, by the time of PEG tube placement in order to prevent any peristomal infections that might result from the procedure.",

      "content": "Percutaneous  endoscopic  gastrostomy  (PEG)  is  an  endoscopic technique used to surgically place a feeding tube into the stomach (Geeganage 2012). PEG tubes are used to maintain adequate nutrition in the short- or long-term. PEG placement was first described over 20 years ago (Gauderer 1980), and has since become a convenient, relatively safe and simple procedure. PEG tubes can be used to deliver a liquid diet, as well as medication, via a clean, or sterile, delivery system.\nPEG tube placement may be required when patients have:\n· an altered level of consciousness;\n· dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing);\n· tumour(s);\n· had a neurological event;\n· tracheal-oesophageal fistula; or\n· chronic reflux problems.\n(Tham 1997) suggested that PEG tube placement was contraindicated in patients with rapidly-progressing, incurable disease, and in those who were likely to recover from their swallowing difficulties  quickly,  for  example,  some  stroke  patients.  Similarly,  Skelly 2002 did not recommend PEG tube placement in patients who were in a permanent vegetative state, and produced a decision-making algorithm which stated that patients with anorexia-cachexia syndromes should not be offered them either.\nPlacement of a PEG tube is usually undertaken by a doctor with the aid of an assistant (often a nurse) - although the changing role of the nurse may mean that nurses could undertake this procedure at some point in the future. A choice of techniques is available. These include pushing, or pulling, through an introducer, with the pull through technique being the most widely used. The 'pull' technique involves the use of an endoscope to guide placement of the tube, which is pulled through the mouth, oesophagus, stomach and abdominal wall to the outside. The 'push' technique uses an endoscope to illuminate and insufflate the stomach in order to guide placement of the tube, then a trocar is pushed through the abdominal wall from the outside and the PEG tube is fed into the abdominal wall over a guide-wire.\nThose undergoing PEG tube placement are often vulnerable to infection for a variety of reasons including old age, compromised nutritional intake, immunosuppression and underlying disease such as malignancy and diabetes mellitus (Lee 2002). As the increase in the incidence of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) poses  an  additional  risk  for  the  procedure,  there  is  debate  concerning the merits of antibiotic prophylaxis (Ogundipe 2004), and whether MRSA naso-pharyngeal colonisation may be a predictor of peristomal infection in PEG tube placement by means of the pull technique (Hull 2001). Infection associated with PEG tube placement accounts for many of the minor, major and fatal complications incurred by patients with PEG tubes (Calton 1992; Nicholson 2000). Superficial surgical site infections (i.e. peristomal) caused by PEG tube placement involve skin, or subcutaneous tissue, and at least one of the following: pus; a swab with more than 10 6  colony forming units (cfu) per mm$^{3} tissue; pain; localised swelling; redness and heat; as diagnosed by the attending clinician (Mangram 1999). The procedure has a mortality rate  of  approximately  2%  (Skelly 2002).\nAntimicrobial agents destroy or inhibit the multiplication of bacteria, fungi, protozoa or viruses (Perry 2002). Antimicrobial prophylaxis for surgery comprises a very brief course of an antimicrobial agent, often initiated intravenously just before the operation begins, which may continue for a set period of time post-operatively. Delivery of the initial dose of an antimicrobial agent ensures that a  prophylactic,  bactericidal  concentration  of  the  drug  is  present in the serum and tissues by the time the skin is incised (Mangram 1999).\nA systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of prophylactic antibiotics for PEG tube placement was published in 2000 (Sharma 2000). This review supported the use of prophylactic antibiotics for the procedure, and, currently, both national and international guidelines advocate the use of antibiotic prophylaxis (BSG 2001; Rey 1998). One US study performed a cost analysis of antibiotic prophylaxis for PEG tube placement, which was based on seven randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and found it a cost-effective strategy in the prevention of infection (Kulling 2000).\nA  Cochrane  systematic  review  on  the  subject  was  originally  justified,  as  the  review by Sharma 2000 has not been updated, and contained methodological weaknesses; specifically, it was limited to  published studies, with no attempts made to retrieve unpublished work. For the updated Cochrane review (this is the third update) we undertook new searches and attempted to retrieve unpublished studies as well as any newly-published studies. Before the first update was published in 2008, another systematic review was  published  that  confirmed  the  need  for  prophylactic  antibiotics  (Jafri  2007),  and  calculated  on  the  basis  of  numbers-needed-to-treat  that  penicillin-based  prophylaxis  was  more  effective than cephalosporin-based prophylaxis.",

Following personal correspondence, Dormann 2000 was identified as the primary study report, when confirmed by the author as being the largest and latest study. Of the 13 included trials, 12 involved both males and females, while one comprised men only (Jonas 1985). Trial sizes ranged from 37 patients (Jonas 1985), to 347 patients (Gossner 1999). The trials included hospitalised and nursing-home patients referred for PEG tube placement, mainly for malignancy or neurological reasons that caused dysphagia. All trials took place in industrial countries, namely Germany (four trials), USA (three trials), Netherlands (one trial), Sweden (one trial) and the UK (four trials).",

In  one  trial,  patients  were randomised into groups that received penicillin (piperacillin with tazobactam), or cephalosporin (cefotaxime), or no antibiotic (Gossner  1999).  One  trial  compared  co-trimoxazole  with  cefuroxime (Blomberg 2010). In one study, patients were given co-amoxiclav,\nor  cephalosporin  (cefotaxime)  if  they  were  allergic  to  penicillin (Saadeddin 2005).\nIn all trials but one antibiotics were administered intravenously (IV) either by bolus (Ahmad 2003; Akkersdijk 1995; Dormann 2000; Jain 1987; Jonas 1985; Panigrahi 2002; Radhakrishnan 2006; Saadeddin 2005; Shastri 2008; Sturgis 1996), or infusion (Gossner 1999; Preclik 1999).

In the trial by Preclik 1999, a sample size of 180 patients was calculated to detect a reduction in peristomal and other infections from 20% to 5% in the antibiotic group. An interim calculation was performed part way through because the reduction in infection had been achieved, and the study was prematurely terminated with 106 patients in two groups.

We could not determine which treatment group these patients had been in for either trial.\nCare of the peristomal site after PEG tube placement was described in seven trials, all of which used dry dressing without topical products (Ahmad 2003; Dormann 2000; Gossner 1999; Jain 1987; Preclik 1999; Saadeddin 2005; Sturgis 1996).

      "content": "The results of this review support the use of systemic antibiotics and show that broad spectrum antibiotics are effective against peristomal infection in PEG tube placement. This supports current UK, European and USA guidelines (BSG 2001; Locke 2000; Rey 1998), and two previous systematic reviews (Jafri 2007; Sharma 2000).\nThe  included  trials  were  of  a  reasonable  quality,  and,  although based on relatively small numbers, power calculations (where performed) suggested adequate sample sizes had been used (Ahmad 2003; Blomberg 2010; Dormann 2000; Jain 1987; Preclik 1999). The trials with inadequate allocation concealment showed fewer infections in the antibiotic groups than the trials with adequate allocation concealment.\nThe push method was used in at least two studies. Shastri 2008 used the push method alone, Akkersdijk 1995 compared push and pull methods and one study did not specify the method (Sturgis 1996). It is possible that pushing the PEG device through the abdominal wall, rather than pulling it though the nasopharynx and gastrointestinal tract, could avoid the risk of contamination by naso-pharyngeal organisms including MRSA. This route may therefore negate the need for systemic prophylactic antibiotics. Further robust studies using the push method are needed to establish the evidence base.\nPooled  analysis  of  twelve  trials  included  in  the  review,  comparing  antibiotics  with  antibiotics  or  placebo  or  no  intervention  or skin antiseptic, showed a consistently beneficial effect for antibiotics. In one trial antibiotics plus a skin antiseptic were employed with more favourable results than antibiotic alone (Radhakrishnan 2006), however, this finding should be interpreted with caution because of the small numbers involved.\nFollow-up  was  insufficient  in  some  trials  (3-30  days)  which  may have reduced the statistical power of the studies, particularly in the light of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) recommendation for a 30-day follow-up period to ensure that all surgical site infections are captured (Mangram 1999). Blinding in two trials may have been compromised, as PEG delivery of antibiotics (Blomberg 2010) and the use of the skin antiseptic could not be disguised (Radhakrishnan 2006).\nBroad-spectrum bactericidal antibiotics were used in all the trials reviewed. The type of antibiotics used depended on the origin of\nthe study, as the recommendations given by UK, European and USA societies of gastroenterology cited different evidence available at the times of publication. Much of the current guidance is based on the trials included in this review. For example, one German study (Gossner  1999)  used  piperacillin  and  tazobactam  in  comparison with  cefotaxime.  Both  these  drugs  are  recommended  as  part  of the European Society guidance (Rey 1998). One systematic review found that only six patients needed to be treated to prevent one peristomal infection when penicillin-based antibiotics were administered, compared to 10 patients for cephalosporin-based antibiotics (Jafri 2007).\nThere were prescribing differences between trials with regard to method of delivery, dose, and timing of antibiotics. The method of delivery was intravenous, by bolus or infusion, or by bolus via PEG catheter in all trials. Intravenous delivery is the UK standard for systemic antibiotic prophylaxis (BMA and RPS 2004). The dose of antibiotics given for prophylaxis was generally in accordance with routine formulary prescribing guidance for each drug used. Timing and length of administration of the systemic antibiotics varied between trials. The aim of antibiotics is to establish a bactericidal concentration in the tissues prior to PEG tube placement. This may have been compromised in the trials in which administration was not completed until immediately before PEG tube placement.\nIn summary, prophylactic antibiotics in PEG tube placement using the 'pull' method result in a statistically significant reduction in the number of peristomal infections.",
