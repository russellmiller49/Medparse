The pathway for clinical workup of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA patients in this study is shown in   Figure 2  .\nFor NPs, collections (not charges) were obtained from both professional and technical billing. Collections were calculated from 30 days prior to 180 days after the procedure. The 30 days prior to the procedure were included because part of the initial NP consultation for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA could include ordering additional  studies,  such  as  CT  scans,  PET  scans,  or  pulmonary function tests. Other diagnostic tools used at MUSC to diagnose lung cancer (eg, CT scan-guided biopsy, other bronchoscopies including navigational procedures, and EUS fi  ne-needle aspiration) were included. To avoid counting collections unrelated to the initial Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, 180 days after the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA procedure was felt to be a conservative time period to allow for the measurement  of  downstream  revenue  from  the  procedure, though  clearly  patients  with  a  cancer  diagnosis  could  produce considerable downstream revenue past 180 days. Professional collections  were  recorded  according  to  departments  within  the hospital system, and technical collections were recorded according to the diagnosis-related group (DRG) charge. Our institution's payer mix is shown in   Figure 3  . Both professional and technical fee collections were included for all services lines that were part of the revenue analysis.\nSince EPs are expected to continue care at our institution, only the downstream services directly related to the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA were  recorded.  Collections  were  not  determined  for  these patients. Services were considered directly related to Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA when  a  diagnosis  was  made  using  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA  that  led  to further  diagnostic  workup  or  treatment  within  the  system. These services were counted for a 180-day period following the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA. The majority of the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA procedures are  outpatient  procedures,  so  these  situations  were  rare,  but when patients who were hospitalized underwent Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, they were considered EPs even when they had no prior encounters with the system. These hospitalizations were not included in the count of the number of hospitalizations since the reason for hospitalization was not directly associated with the EBUSTBNA.

      "content": "Three hundred and sixty-seven Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA procedures were performed at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) during 2008 and 2009, of which 200 consecutive Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA cases were reviewed for this study. A start date of June 30, 2008, was chosen at random. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the MUSC.\nAdditional devices were required for these procedures to be used in  conjunction  with  preexisting  standard  bronchoscopic video monitors. All Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA procedures were performed with a BF-UC160F-OL8 bronchoscope, NA-201SX-4022 singleuse aspiration needles, and an EU-C60 ultrasound processor (Olympus America). All physician faculty members at MUSC are members of our physician practice plan and are either salaried employees or have a base salary with built-in clinical productivity incentives.\nA medical records review was performed, and patients were categorized as either established patients (EPs) or new patients (NPs) to the health-care system within 30 days of the EBUSTBNA. The NPs were referred by physicians not affi  liated with MUSC. The NPs were subdivided into those who had a brief interaction of less than six visits and no hospitalizations (NPBIs) and those who remained in the system for continued care (NPCCs) (  Fig 1  ). Revenue was divided based on EPs and NPs to clarify how many patients entered the system because of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA. We concentrated this evaluation on the NPs so that the economic benefi  t  analysis  would  be  conservative.  If  EPs  were  included,  it could be argued that the additional fi  nancial impact from the procedure  in  this  subset  would  have  occurred  anyway.  Another reason to subdivide NPs was to further differentiate revenue based on referrals for patients who returned to their health-care system of origin (NPBIs) and those who stayed for continued care (NPCCs) and were thus responsible for the greatest downstream revenue.\nOnce each patient's category was determined, the chart was abstracted. Patient demographics, distance from our institution, and diagnosis (cancer vs other) were recorded (  Table 1  ). Medical records were reviewed to identify and abstract the services used by each patient that were directly related to Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA. Variables collected for revenue analysis included the number of radiologic  studies,  consults  to  other  specialties  (eg,  thoracic  surgery, medical oncology, etc), pathology consults, hospitalizations, procedures,  and  treatments  related  to  the  diagnosis  made  using Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA. Data from chart abstraction were collected in the\nments  and  almost  identical  numbers  of  consults and hospitalizations.\nThe payer  mix  at  this  institution  was  composed primarily of Medicare, Medicaid, and indigent care. Private insurance only made up 31% of the payer mix (  Fig  3  ).  The  collections  received  by  the  hospital  that  were  attributable  to  NPs  who  underwent Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA were $2.4 million. Of this, $1.97 million was  generated  from  technical  fees  and  $440,000 from professional fees. Therefore, the downstream collections  from  technical  fees  per  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA were $19,174. The rate of collections was approximately 25% of billed charges, which corresponds with  the  known  collection  rates  in  our  hospital system.\ngreatest percentage of cancer diagnoses (75% diagnosed with lung or metastatic cancer) by Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA.\nThe  diagnostic  and  therapeutic  encounters  with the hospital system as a result of the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA referrals are listed in   Table 2 for the NPs and EPs. Additionally,  in  the  30  days  prior  to  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, the NPs underwent 30 radiologic studies, 94 consults, and  28  procedures  that  were  done  as  part  of  the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA referral.\nWhile the EPs accounted for the majority of the encounters following Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, the NPs who continued  care  at  the  institution  (NPCCs)  had  a very  similar  number  of  encounters  following  the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA  procedure  (  Table  2  ).  Both  groups underwent identical numbers of chemotherapy treat-\nData shown as No. (%) unless otherwise indicated.

In  the  US health-care system, the fi  nancial bottom line remains a critical issue to hospital systems, so relying on cost savings as a selling point to hospitals in the United States may not work.

      "content": "This  study  has  several  important  fi  ndings:  First, over  a  13-month  time  frame,  97  NPs  generated $2.4  million in collections. Were we to estimate the collections  generated  by  the  procedure  alone,  it would be $70,131 (97 patients times a $723 Medicare national average hospital outpatient payment for Current Procedural Terminology code 31629).  10 This  is  a  conservative  estimate  that  only  includes this payment and not any ancillary charges, such as anesthesia, which were not used for any of these procedures. Second, when the NPs were referred and remained in the system, their use of hospital services was similar to that of the EPs. Third, patients\nperiods  when  the  bronchoscope  was  damaged  and procedures had to be postponed (typically , 1 week turnaround  for  repairs).  A  different  way  to  calculate this would be based on collections per patient ($2.4 million per 97 patients). Both are conservative estimates but further validate the point that investing in  this  technology  was  worth  the  cost.  These  calculations are based on the payer mix from a state-supported academic medical center that likely has a lower percentage of private insurance coverage compared with private health-care institutions. In an employment arrangement like this one, where physicians are fully employed by a hospital system, there is more likely to be a collaborative atmosphere among employed physicians  and  the  hospital  fi  nancial  department.  In  a private hospital system, where physician employment is  separate  from  the  hospital  system,  there  may  be more  barriers  to  obtaining  fi  nancial  information  to make estimates of profi  t from a new procedure. Relatively speaking, the fi  nancial benefi  t to pulmonologists is modest. The technical fee is the same as that for a traditional blind TBNA, and the professional fee is only slightly more. These reimbursement rates are low relative to the procedural time, especially for complete  mediastinal  staging  procedures.  This  represents time away from potentially higher paying endeavors by the pulmonologist, such as critical care time, outpatient collections, or polysomnography interpretation.  In  striking  comparison,  the  fi  nancial  gain  to other services such as medical oncology, radiology, and radiation oncology from an Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA program is large. To reimburse physicians performing Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA in a more equitable way, a future direction may entail revenue sharing, where physicians receive  compensation  in  whole  or  in  part  based on the economic benefi  t of their services (eg, cancer care) to the hospital. Alternatively, local centers of excellence in Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA may develop that maintain the necessary procedural volume to justify purchase of the necessary equipment and avoid duplication of expenses by smaller hospitals.\nHaving an Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA program led to the referral of NPs to our health-care system (52% of EBUSTBNA referrals),  of  which  a  signifi  cant  proportion (43%) stayed in our system. We found that providing an Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA service captured patients statewide and  from  neighboring  states,  thus  expanding  the catchment area of the hospital system. As evidenced by  advertisement  campaigns,  health-care  systems are interested in the potential of new technology, particularly minimally invasive techniques, to attract patients who otherwise would have been treated by other systems. The NPs who stayed for care in our system  (NPCCs) used hospital  resources  like  the EPs did. This key fi  nding supports a very broad fi  nancial  benefi  t  of  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA  to  a  hospital  system:\nknowledge,  this  is  the  fi  rst  study  to  examine  the downstream  fi  nancial  benefi  t  of  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA  to  a hospital system. A similar technology, EUS, has been shown to generate downstream procedures and professional charges that attenuate the lower reimbursement for a half day of EUS compared with a half day of colonoscopy. 15  It should be noted that unlike Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA,  which  lost  an  additional  technical fee relative to traditional bronchoscopy with TBNA, EUS  still  commands  an  additional  technical  fee reimbursement.\nOn the surface, a capital investment of $90,000 to $130,000 plus ongoing maintenance costs of as much as $100 per procedure 16  seem particularly high, especially if the calculation is made using only the reimbursement for that procedure when making decisions about capital investment. By calculating downstream revenue  to  a  health-care  system,  we  were  able  to demonstrate that for a capital investment of approximately  $100,000,  the  health-care  system  could generate $2.4 million in collections after 13 months of having an Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA service (based on revenue generated from all 97 NPs, each followed for 7  months).  This  calculation  was  based  on  the  purchase of only 1 Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscope and allowed for\nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA 5 endobronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle aspiration. See Table 1 legend for expansion of other abbreviations.\ntypically a point of contention to referring physicians when thoracic oncology services were unique to this institution  relative  to  our  surrounding  region.  This may not be the case at other institutions that are far less  likely  to  retain  NPs  referred  for  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA due to the presence of comprehensive medical centers in the close vicinity.\nWhen introducing Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, loss of revenue from existing procedures was excluded from our calculation. Hospital systems could argue that revenue was  lost  from  procedures  such  as  mediastinoscopy, which  has  greater  fi  nancial  reimbursement  than Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA.  Although  this  procedure  carries  a higher risk, it remains an acceptable alternative, and there may be important economic incentives to physicians and hospital systems performing it.\nThe strengths of the study included the use of conservative economic estimates to avoid bias. While we  tracked  the  services  used  by  EPs  related  to Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, we purposely did not include their downstream collections in our revenue analysis. By excluding this downstream revenue, we underestimated  the  overall  revenue  because  some  of  the profi  ts (eg, radiologic, pathologic, consultations) can be cost accounted to the procedure. NPs were divided into NPBIs and NPCCs to demonstrate the proportion  of  patients  who  remained  in  the  system  after Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA. In addition, collections rather than charges were used, which provided a more conservative estimate of revenue, especially considering the payer mix at a state-supported institution.\nHow should physicians proceed when considering introducing new technology? First, perform a needs assessment. Second, perform an environmental scan of  resources  such  as  the  availability  of  space  and ancillary support. Third, the physician must address issues such as the need and availability of training and the effect of local competition on estimates of procedural volume. One must realize that a gain in referrals from one sector of the referral base could lead to a loss in referrals from another if it is perceived that new technology threatens existing  approaches  used by other physicians. Physicians must assess their own\nPatients, even from a signifi  cant distance, can continue  their  medical  care  in  the  institution  where the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA is performed.\nSubtle benefi  ts may also be realized by expanding the referral pattern of a hospital. Satisfaction with the  services  that  were  downstream  from  the  initial Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA is a likely source of positive advertisement and future referrals. Of patients undergoing Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, cancer was the most common diagnosis, accounting for nearly half of the patients undergoing this procedure. To the extent that some hospitals market comprehensive cancer care, the high proportion of patients who undergo Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for cancer would be attractive to hospital administrators. Routine use of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA may also help galvanize together a multidisciplinary oncologic approach including pulmonologists, radiologists, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and thoracic surgeons. Having multidisciplinary cancer clinics has been shown to increase patient satisfaction, 17  and it may have led to the continuity of care between the NPCC group and the hospital system that was seen in this study. A potential strategy to gain funding from hospital administrators may be to partner with other specialties that treat patients with cancer and that would stand to benefi  t from the introduction of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA.\nWeaknesses of this study include its retrospective method: the fact that it was performed at a tertiary care  center  with  pulmonologists  trained  in  EBUSTBNA and with a large multidisciplinary thoracic oncology program with high volumes. This may make it  less  reproducible  in  the  community  hospital  setting. In addition, it could be argued that some NPs who were referred for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA could have been referred anyway by virtue of our institution being a tertiary referral center with extended resources. This referral center is the only comprehensive university medical center in the state and is a National Cancer Center-designated center, so many services or clinical trials are not available elsewhere in the state. The institution  enjoys  opportunities  to  retain  patients even  after  procedures  such  as  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA  are performed. In our case, retention of patients was not\n2  .    Gomez   M  ,    Silvestri    GA  .    Endobronchial  ultrasound  for  the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer  .

In order to capitalize on a hospital system's resources to acquire data on local health-care needs, the hospital administration should be involved early. Hospital administrators provide a specifi  c and important set of skills (eg, fi  nancial  analysis,  hospital  budgeting  processes,  development of business pro forma  , identifi  cation of barriers, etc) that can improve a physician's chance of success. Presenting your plan to those making purchasing decisions is best done in tandem with the physician extolling the clinical need and the administrator supporting the fi  nancial viability of the technology. Identify  stakeholders  who  stand  to  gain  and  those  who stand to lose from the introduction of the new technology (eg, cancer center director, division chief, members of the thoracic oncology working group). Engage these individuals early in the process to use their resources and advice (  Table 3  ).\nTo  summarize,  while  this  calculation  of  downstream  revenue  may  not  be  reproducible  in  all medical  centers,  there  is  value  in  applying  it  to health-care  systems  contemplating  the  purchase  of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA. Modest reimbursement for valuable diagnostic  tools  should  not  dissuade  hospitals  from purchasing  when  downstream  revenue  has  been shown to justify the capital investment. The presence of new and effective technology drew patients to  our  hospital  system  from  outside  the  typical referral base, many of whom stayed in the system and generated  downstream  revenue  similar  to  that  of EPs. We propose that there are also intangible benefi  ts  such  as  marketing for the institution and capturing patients into the system who would otherwise have been treated elsewhere.",
