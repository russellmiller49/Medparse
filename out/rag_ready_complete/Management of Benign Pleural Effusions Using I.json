All patients in the included studies underwent IPC placement for refractory BPE after being considered to have received optimal medical management.\nThe secondary outcomes included the time to pleurodesis, complication rates, and the number of patients requiring additional pleural procedures such as injection of a thrombolytic agent to treat a clogged IPC, antibiotic use, and replacement of the IPC. The safety of the IPC was assessed by the rate of complications. The complications were further divided into major and minor categories. Major complications were de /uniFB01 ned as ones that (1) required premature removal or replacement of the IPC, (2) produced serious infections such as empyema or sepsis, (3) produced pneumothorax, and (4) required additional invasive pleural procedures. Minor complications were de /uniFB01 ned as ones that did not require catheter removal and were managed conservatively without any invasive pleural intervention. The use of thrombolytic therapy to treat IPC blockage was considered a minor complication.",

The results of the studies were combined in a meta-analysis using standard random-effects models, from which estimates of the average rates were obtained with 95% CIs. The models were also used to obtain 95% prediction intervals, which represent the range within which we would expect the rate of the new study to occur. The heterogeneity of the study outcomes was assessed using Q and I 2 statistics. The Q statistic evaluates the homogeneity assumption (ie, all studies have the same common rate), whereas the I 2 statistic represents the amount of variability in the meta-analysis attributed to study heterogeneity. There is a clear difference among the studies included in the analyses with multiple uncontrolled variables. The random-effects model was used because of the obvious heterogeneity.\nForest plots were presented to summarize the results. Every study that was included in the analysis represented a horizontal line. The center square represented the estimated effect, and the line represented the 95% CI. The combined effect of all the studies was similarly represented. Funnel plots were used to look for publication bias with the Egger test, which is a useful tool when conducting a metaanalysis.

Two studies were excluded because IPC was used in the management of cases with underlying hematologic malignancies and after lung transplantation. 17-19 Although the post-lung-transplantation pleural effusions were benign in nature, pleurodesis would be signi /uniFB01 cantly affected by the thoracic surgery, and the role of the IPC in achieving pleurodesis is questionable. Therefore, we excluded this study from the analysis to avoid selection bias. We also excluded a study by Schneider et al 19 in which the IPCs were placed in malignant and nonmalignant effusions. In this study, the majority of nonmalignant effusions were of unclear cause, as 10 of the 12 patients were diagnosed with chronic in /uniFB02 ammatory pleurisy. Additionally, the authors did not clearly de /uniFB01 ne the complication rate of IPC placement between malignant and nonmalignant effusions, and therefore it was not possible to analyze the outcome. Also, most patients in this study underwent IPC placement as part of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, which can by itself affect the rate of spontaneous pleurodesis and complications. 19\nOne abstract was excluded, as the same authors subsequently published a case series on a subset of their patients. 20 Another abstract by Imler et al 21 was excluded, as the authors described the placement of indwelling catheters in patients with refractory ascites or HH, but most catheters were placed in the peritoneal cavity, and the abstract did not reveal any IPC placement details such as pleurodesis and complication\nrates. 21 Three reports were found to be case reports and were excluded (Fig 1). 22-24\nThirteen studies totaling 325 patients were included in the analysis. Eight of the 13 studies were published after 2010, 8-13,24-26 and seven of these were published as case series.

The majority of patients were men (175 patients [53.8%]). In all included studies, the IPC was used for BPE that was refractory despite optimal medical therapy. The causes of underlying effusion were cardiac causes (49.8%), hepatic disease (12.3%), chylothorax (3.4%), empyema (2.8%), in /uniFB02 ammatory pleurisy (6.5%), renal disease (4.0%), yellow nail syndrome (1.5%), and others (19.7%), as shown in Table 2. Three hundred /uniFB01 fty IPCs were placed in 325 patients. Based on the available studies, it was dif /uniFB01 cult to estimate the duration of IPC in situ in all patients, because most of the included studies did not describe the mean time from IPC placement to a complication that required catheter removal. IPCs were inserted for symptom management, as a bridge to cardiac or liver transplantation, or for palliative purposes.",

Overall, there were nine reported cases of empyema, and all were treated medically without any surgical intervention.

      "content": "The results of our analysis show that IPCs can be used effectively in the management of BPEs, with an estimated spontaneous pleurodesis rate of 51.3%, and could be considered in patients with refractory BPE for palliation. These results are similar to the meta-analysis conducted in a MPE population, which reported a spontaneous pleurodesis rate of 45%. 33 To our knowledge, this is the /uniFB01 rst meta-analysis that addresses the use of IPC in the management of BPE. We acknowledge that the major limitation of our study is that the reports included in this meta-analysis are non-randomized-controlled trials with low quality of evidence, but this is currently the best available data on this topic.\nAbout 70% of patients with CHF have pleural effusion at some stage of their disease, 34 whereas 5% to 10% of patients with portal hypertension and 20% of patients receiving hemodialysis experience pleural effusion. 35,36 A small proportion of patients with heart failure experience pleural effusion despite receiving optimal medical care for their CHF. The treatment options for these patients are serial thoracenteses or surgical or chemical pleurodesis. Repeating thoracentesis entails multiple clinic or hospital visits, and this is challenging in cases in which the /uniFB02 uid is rapidly reaccumulating and in patients receiving anticoagulation therapy. Surgical or thoracoscopic pleurodesis has emerged as an option, but\nDescription of Readmission Rates and Placement\nTP ¼ thoracoscopic pleurodesis. See Table 1 legend for expansion of other abbreviations.\n]\nregardless of the type of chemical used in pleurodesis, there is a potential risk of respiratory complications associated with sclerosing agents and the longer need for hospital stay due to the amount of /uniFB02 uid drainage and management of postpleurodesis pain. 25,37,38 Patients with HH are particularly dif /uniFB01 cult to manage. The treatment options for refractory HH are serial thoracenteses, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, pleurodesis, thoracoscopic diaphragmatic defect repair, and liver transplantation. Some patients do not qualify for the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt procedure, and surgical pleurodesis for treatment in HH was disappointing and is currently limited to patients with no other treatment options. 39-41\nThe rate of spontaneous pleurodesis was our primary ef /uniFB01 cacy outcome. The estimated average rate of spontaneous pleurodesis was 51.3% for all benign conditions. Although CHF was the most common cause of BPE (49.8%) in our study, the estimated average rate of spontaneous pleurodesis in the cardiac cases was lower (42.1%) than in the noncardiac cases (61.4%), but the difference was not statistically signi /uniFB01 cant. The exact mechanism of how IPC insertion leads to spontaneous pleurodesis is not known, 42 so it is hard to explain the difference in the rate of spontaneous pleurodesis among cardiac and noncardiac pleural effusions. One possible mechanism could be a low-grade in /uniFB02 ammatory reaction that develops in response to the catheter acting as a foreign body in the pleural space. 9 However, the placement of IPCs for MPE was not associated with any changes in systemic in /uniFB02 ammatory markers. 43\nConcerning symptomatic improvement, Srour et al 13 and Potechin et al 12 showed an improvement in dyspnea using the transitional dyspnea index score, whereas other studies reported a subjective improvement in\ndyspnea among the majority of the patients. 20,31 Along with symptomatic improvement, IPC use produced a reduced length of hospital stay and a reduction in readmission rates, which are relevant clinical outcomes. These results indicate that patients with IPCs had less dyspnea as well as improved symptoms; they also stayed out of the hospital. Thus, IPC is a viable option for palliation in selected patients with refractory BPE.\nBased on our systematic review, our results concur with a previous study by Chalhoub et al 9 that showed a longer IPC duration (110 days vs 36 days) in patients with BPE when compared with MPE. The longer duration of IPC in benign effusions may be because patients with benign effusion have a longer survival compared with patients with MPE, many of whom die with an IPC in place. Despite a longer IPC duration in BPE, the estimated average rate of all complications was 17.2%, which is similar to the overall complication rate in MPE. 44 There was only one death related to IPC use in the study by Herlihy et al, 27 which also showed a signi /uniFB01 cantly higher complication rate compared with other studies performed in patients with CHF. A possible explanation for the lower complication rate in subsequent studies and our analysis could be better patient selection and the fact that the studies were conducted in centers experienced in the management of patients with chronic IPC. 8,10,11,13,20,25,34 Two cases of renal failure with IPC use were reported by Bhatnagar et al. 8 Both these patients had IPC drainage of more than 3 L per week while receiving oral diuretic agents and experiencing concomitant diarrhea. Thus, it is unclear whether the renal failure could be solely attributed to IPC. Although none of the other studies reported any signi /uniFB01 cant electrolyte abnormalities with IPC use for BPE, it would be prudent to monitor electrolyte and serum protein levels in these patients.\nThe major limitation of our study is that none of the included studies is a high-quality randomized controlled trial, as none have been published on this topic. There is a signi /uniFB01 cant heterogeneity among the studies included in clinical outcomes ( I 2 ¼ 87.2%) and complications ( I 2 ¼ 74.7%). Heterogeneity was related to differences in underlying cause, patient selection, follow-up period, and handling of outcome measures. We used a randomeffects model to minimize the effect of heterogeneity. Another signi /uniFB01 cant limitation is the effect of missing data on the results. For example, from 38 IPCs that were removed secondary to complications, detailed information about the complications was reported in only /uniFB01 ve cases. We assumed that the missing\ninformation was at random but do acknowledge that a signi /uniFB01 cant number of minor complications could have been severe enough to have led to catheter removal.",

Studies of higher quality are required further to evaluate the use of IPC in the treatment of BPE.",
