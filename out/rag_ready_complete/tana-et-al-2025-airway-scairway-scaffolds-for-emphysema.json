    "abstract": "Rationale: Despite advancements in emphysema treatment, high morbidity and mortality rates highlight the need for innovative therapies. A novel self-expanding nitinol airway scaffold was designed to alleviate lung hyperinflation by connecting emphysematous parenchyma with central bronchi, releasing trapped air. Objectives: To assess the feasibility, safety, and initial outcomes of airway scaffolds in treating emphysema-related hyperinflation. Methods: We conducted a pooled analysis of two first-in-human studies (NCT05949645, NCT05854550) involving patients with heterogeneous or homogeneous emphysema treated bronchoscopically with up to three permanent airway scaffolds per lung. Measurements and Main Results: The primary outcome was safety, measured by procedure- and/or device-related serious adverse events over 6 months. Secondary outcomes were technical feasibility, pulmonary function, quality of life, symptoms, exercise capacity at 3 and 6 months, and airway patency assessment by high-resolution computed tomography. Sixty severe emphysema patients (33 female, 27 male; mean age, 66 6 8 yr; mean residual volume percent predicted, 255 6 47%) were included. Ninety-eight procedures were performed, and 328 airway scaffolds were successfully placed. A proportion of 21.7% of patients experienced at least one related serious adverse event within 6 months, including pneumonia (10.0%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation (5.0%), but no pneumothoraxes occurred. Residual volume improved (decreased) from baseline by a mean [95% con /uniFB01 dence interval] of 866 [626, 1,106] ml at 3 months and 753 [512, 994] ml at 6 months. Clinically meaningful improvements were further observed in spirometry, quality of life, symptoms, and exercise capacity. Conclusions: This study provides the first clinical evidence of the feasibility, safety, and initial outcomes after treatment with airway scaffolds in patients with emphysema-related hyperinflation. The BREATHE study (Study to Assess Safety, Feasibility, and Preliminary Ef /uniFB01 cacy of the Apreo Implant for Severe Emphysema) comprised two prospective, multicenter, single-arm clinical trials: BREATHE-1 (NCT05854550) in Australia and BREATHE-2 (NCT05949645) in Europe. Both studies followed very similar protocols with minor differences in study procedures and eligibility criteria. Procedures differed with BREATHE-1 patients undergoing one fewer computed tomographic (CT) scan and BREATHE-2 patients undergoing one fewer bronchoscopy during the follow-up interval. Eligibility differed with respect to inclusion criteria (baseline FEV1, 20 -50% predicted for patients enrolled in BREATHE-1 vs. 15 -50% predicted for those enrolled in BREATHE-2) and exclusion criteria (three or more acute exacerbations of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the prior year, history of excessive dynamic collapse of the trachea or main bronchi, and coronary artery disease with angina were exclusionary for BREATHE-1 patients). BREATHE-1 also complied with Australian regulations, whereas BREATHE-2 followed European Union Medical Device Reporting and U.K. Medical Device Reporting requirements.

Hyperin /uniFB02 ation is associated with poor exercise capacity, impaired pulmonary function, and diminished quality of life and can contribute to appetite loss, depression, cardiac issues, and increased mortality (17 -18). Many COPDtreatments fail because they do not address the root cause of hyperin /uniFB02 ation: air trapping due to expiratory airway collapse.\nThe EASE (Exhale Airway Stents for Emphysema) trial (5), which addressed hyperin /uniFB02 ation by the creation of transbronchial passages supported with paclitaxel-eluting stents directly connecting emphysematous lung tissue with central airways, evaluated whether airway bypass could improve pulmonary function and symptoms in patients with homogeneous emphysema and severe hyperin /uniFB02 ation. Although this trial did demonstrate proof of principle in that air trapping was reduced and pulmonary function was improved in patients immediately after treatment, it failed to show sustained long-term bene /uniFB01 ts. The loss of the initial bene /uniFB01 ts was believed to be caused by the loss of airway bypass patency (obstruction due to mucus and granulation tissue) and stent dislodgment (13% at stents were lost by 6 mo).\nTo address this, a novel, helix-shaped, self-expanding nitinol airway scaffold was developed. Designed to be bronchoscopically placed with one end positioned in emphysematous lung tissue and the other in more central bronchi, the scaffolds reinforce and expand the collapsible native bronchial tree, allowing trapped air to escape during exhalation. These airway scaffolds are also designed to prevent occlusion and migration, offering a durable, effective solution for releasing trapped air and improving patient symptoms.\nThe main goal of this study was to evaluate the safety of the airway scaffolds in patients with hyperin /uniFB02 ation caused by emphysema by combining the results from two prospective /uniFB01 rst-in-human studies. Secondary objectives were the assessment of technical feasibility and preliminary ef /uniFB01 cacy. Some of the results of these studies were previously reported in the form of an abstract (19).",

Up to three target segments per lung were selected on the basis of the combination of signi /uniFB01 cant emphysematous destruction, relatively high inspiratory volume, and evidence of air trapping. Patients with bilateral disease received up to six airway scaffolds (three per lung) either in a single procedure or over two procedures separated by 30 days. Patients with unilateral disease received a total of three airway scaffolds in the diseased lung.\nThe implant procedures were performed with the patient under general anesthesia, and the airway scaffolds were deployed under direct bronchoscopic and /uniFB02 uoroscopic visualization. Airway scaffolds were deployed with the distal tip of the delivery system 10 -20 mm from the outer surface of the lung with the intent to land the proximal end of the airway scaffold in a third-generation airway. Prophylactic antibiotics and corticosteroids were administered periprocedurally and for at least 2 days after the procedure.\nFollow-up visits were scheduled at 1 month (BREATHE-2 patients who underwent a single procedure only), 3 months, and 6 months after the /uniFB01 rst procedure and included adverse event (AE) assessment, spirometry, body plethysmography, St. George ' s Respiratory Questionnaire for Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Patients (SGRQ-C), COPDAssessment Test (CAT), mMRC dyspnea scale, 6-minute-walk test (6MWT),\nand bronchoscopic assessment of implanted airways. Spirometry, body plethysmography, and the 6-minute-walk test were conducted in accordance with American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society guidelines (20 -22). Spirometry was performed 30 minutes after administration of a bronchodilator, and the test was conducted with the patient in a seated position at the same time of day throughout the study. Global Lung Function Initiative reference equations were applied to determine percent predicted values for pulmonary function parameters. Inspiratory and expiratory chest CT was performed either at 1 month or 3 months for BREATHE-2 study patients, depending on\nwhether they underwent a single procedure or two procedures; all patients had CT performed at 6 months.",

Secondary outcomes included technical feasibility and preliminary ef /uniFB01 cacy. Technical feasibility was assessed by the ability to successfully deploy the airway scaffold in the targeted airway, as determined by the operator. Appropriate placement of the proximal region of the deployed airway scaffold with respect to airway generation (e.g., segmental vs. subsegmental) was\nD\ndetermined bronchoscopically immediately postdeployment and at 3 and 6 months during follow-up bronchoscopies, as well as by review of inspiratory CT images obtained at 3 and 6 months. Appropriate placement of the distal end of the implant (targeted to be approximately 10 -20 mm from the pleural surface) was assessed from CT images obtained at 3 and 6 months by measuring the distance between the distal end of the airway scaffold to the pleura obtained along the longitudinal axis of the airway scaffold.\nPreliminary ef /uniFB01 cacy was assessed as improvements in RV, RV/TLC, FEV1, FVC, SGRQ-C total score, CAT score, mMRC dyspnea scale, and 6-minute-walk distance (6MWD)at 3 and 6 months. The minimal clinically important differences used to evaluate improved clinical response were a 0.31-L decrease in RV, a 4% decrease in RV/TLC, a 100-ml increase in FEV1, a 4-point reduction in SGRQ-C total score, a 2-point decrease in CAT score, a 1-point decrease in mMRC dyspnea scale score, and a 25-meter increase in 6MWD (23 -27).\nAirway diameters were measured at approximately the middle, 10 mm proximal to the distal end of the airway (distal region), and 10 mm distal to the proximal end of the scaffold (proximal region) by quantitative analysis of the expiratory CT images (VIDA Diagnostics) obtained at 6-month follow-up. Airway diameters at 6 months were compared with measurements obtained from the baseline (preimplant) expiratory CT images at approximately the same level along the airway. Airway scaffold patency and mucus were also assessed bronchoscopically in the proximal, middle, and distal thirds post-procedure at 3- and 6-month visits using a semiquantitative scale (refer to the data supplement).\nBaseline quantitative CT measurements from inspiratory scans were used to categorize treated patients post hoc with respect to emphysematous disease distribution and the presence or absence of complete lobar /uniFB01 ssures. A patient was categorized as having homogeneous emphysema if both lungs had an absolute difference of less than 15% in the emphysema destruction score (percentage of voxels less than 2 910 HU) between the upper and lower lobes. Otherwise, the patient was categorized as having heterogeneous emphysema.

The ease of airway scaffold deployment was rated as ' no dif /uniFB01 culty ' for 94.6% of attempted deployments assessed (335 of 354 deployments assessed), ' some dif /uniFB01 culty ' for 3.1% (11 of 354), ' moderate dif /uniFB01 culty ' for 1.4% (5 of 354), and ' very dif /uniFB01 cult ' for 0.8% (3 of 354).\nDefinition of abbreviations : Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; HRCT = highresolution computed tomography; RV = residual volume.\n*Emphysema destruction score was the percentage of voxels below 2 950 Hounsfield units. † Emphysema distribution was assessed as the difference in destruction (percentage of voxels less than 2 910 Hounsfield units) between upper and lower lobes, with a difference of less than 15% defined as homogeneous and a difference of 15% or more defined as heterogeneous. A patient with bilateral homogeneity was categorized as having homogeneous disease. ‡ A patient was categorized as having complete fissures if fissure integrity scores were > 85% for both lungs.\nThe predominant reason for lack of technical success in the 7.6% (27 of 355 attempted deployments) was airway placement either farther proximal or distal than intended. In all cases where the initial deployment was not considered successful, the airway scaffold was removed and a new airway scaffold was successfully deployed in the same target airway. The ease of airway scaffold removal, as assessed by the investigator, was rated as ' no dif /uniFB01 culty ' for 88.9% (24 of 27) of the scaffolds removed, ' some dif /uniFB01 culty ' for 3.7% (1 of 27) of removals, and ' moderate dif /uniFB01 culty ' for 7.4% (2 of 27) of removals. No signi /uniFB01 cant injury was caused by airway scaffold removal.\nOf the implants assessed at the 6-month follow-up bronchoscopy, all implants remained present in the implanted airway and the proximal location had not changed (relative to immediately postdeployment) for 73.2% of the airway scaffolds, as assessed by the investigator. Quantitative measurements from CT scans demonstrated that the average change in the distance between the distal end of the scaffold and the pleura between 3 and 6 months was 2 0.2 mm (range, 2 13.5 mm to 16.1 mm), with 59.0% of implants assessed being within 2.5 mm of the distance measured at 3 months and 97.8% of implants being within 10.0 mm.\nImprovements in ef /uniFB01 cacy outcomes were seen in RV, RV/TLC, FEV1, FVC,\nSGRQ-C, CAT, mMRC, and 6MWD at both the 3- and 6-month follow-up visits, with the mean magnitude of these changes exceeding the minimal clinically important difference (refer to Figure E2 in data supplement). RV improved (decreased) from baseline by a mean [95% CI] of 866 [626, 1,106] ml at 3 months and 753 [512, 994] ml at 6 months ( P , 0.0001). Individual-subject changes from baseline to 6 months for ef /uniFB01 cacy outcomes are provided in waterfall plots (Figure 3). Subgroup analyses of ef /uniFB01 cacy outcomes strati /uniFB01 ed by /uniFB01 ssure integrity and homogeneous/heterogeneous emphysema distribution are provided in Tables E7 and E8.\nPreserved airway patency through 6 months was observed in the majority of evaluable airways (Figure 4). Airway diameters measured from CT images obtained at 6 months at the levels of the proximal, middle, and distal airway scaffold were increased relative to baseline, suggesting persistent expansion of airways postimplant (Figure 5).\nGiven the limitations of peripheral bronchoscopy, bronchoscopic assessments of airway scaffold narrowing and mucus were not possible in all airway scaffolds at all follow-up time points. However, available data supported stability of airway patency between 3 months and 6 months (Figure E4).",

Two /uniFB01 ndings of possible airway scaffold migration were reported during follow-up bronchoscopies; otherwise, no evidence of signi /uniFB01 cant airway scaffold migration was observed. Removal of six airway scaffolds in four patients (6.7%) was attempted via bronchoscopy, occurring 51 6 13 days (range, 37 -65 d) after implantation. Reasons for removal were airway kinking with accompanying dyspnea, lack of patency, and pneumonia as an SAE. Removal of /uniFB01 ve of six airway scaffolds was successful and not associated with tissue injury or other complications. One removal attempt was unsuccessful because the distal end of the device could not be freed with traction via forceps. Because the situs of the proximal portion of the airway scaffold was altered in the removal attempt, the investigator elected to sever this proximal portion, resulting in the removal of an approximately one-fourth length of the airway scaffold; the remaining portion of the airway scaffold was positioned well within the airway. The patient did experience an SAE (respiratory tract infection) associated with the partial removal of the airway scaffold, which resolved without sequelae 18 days after scaffold removal. No clinically signi /uniFB01 cant /uniFB01 ndings were noted upon bronchoscopic evaluation approximately 3 months after the airway scaffold removal (6-month follow-up visit), and the remainder of the airway scaffold was still positioned in the airway.",

Overall, the foreign body response to the airway scaffolds was modest, although a small number were removed because a physician assessed lack of patency.\nThis study included a wide range of patients with severe emphysema. Participants had signi /uniFB01 cant air /uniFB02 ow obstruction (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease grade 3 or 4) and hyperin /uniFB02 ation\n(RV > 180% predicted), with both homogeneous and heterogeneous disease, and a mix of /uniFB01 ssure integrity status. Although the broad inclusion criteria limited the ability to study speci /uniFB01 c subgroups, preliminary evidence suggests the airway scaffolds may bene /uniFB01 t patients, regardless of disease pattern or /uniFB01 ssure integrity.\nThe primary goal of the airway scaffolds is to release trapped air from the lungs, and this was demonstrated by reductions in RV at both 3- and 6-month follow-up visits. This\nreduction in air trapping led to clinically meaningful improvements from baseline for all other major physiological and clinical outcomes measured. The favorable stability and lack of a notable foreign body response to the airway scaffolds likely underlies the preservation of airway scaffold patency and persistent treatment responses observed over the 6-month follow-up period.\nThis result is in sharp contrast to the EASE trial stents, which had a high rate of occlusion and dislodgment (5).

      "content": "may be related to key design and use differences between the airway scaffolds of the present study and the EASE trial stents. First, the airway scaffolds are made from a single wire and constructed in a way that enables them to elongate, shorten, and /uniFB02 ex during breathing/coughing, minimizing local tissue stress when implanted, unlike the EASE trial stents, which, when transbronchially implanted, would impose high tissue stress on the airway wall and likely induce tissue injury and foreign body response. Second, the airway scaffolds are designed to have minimal tissue contact density (de /uniFB01 ned as surface area of scaffold -tissue contact relative to the total area of the supported airway) such that any tissue reaction to the scaffold is likely limited only to the region of direct scaffold -tissue contact as opposed to the EASE trial stents, which had a relatively high tissue contact density and tissue reaction along its entire length. Third, the airway scaffolds have a relatively long length such that they engage with the native airways over multiple generations to help ensure scaffold stability, unlike the EASE trial stents,\nwhich were short and deployed across the airway wall, which made them prone to dislodgment.\nAlthough the /uniFB01 ndings from this study are promising, the results of this /uniFB01 rst-inhuman experience could have been affected by patient selection, identi /uniFB01 cation of target airways and device placement. Re /uniFB01 nements in these areas may further improve results. Another potential limitation of this study is that the study sample size was not based on formal statistical power calculations. In addition, without a control group, direct comparisons with other treatments are not possible. The most frequently reported SAEs, pneumonia and Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation, may have been related to frequent bronchoscopic follow-up procedures, but this cannot be concluded because of the lack of a control group.\nIn conclusion, the study demonstrated the technical feasibility of a novel airway scaffold placement to tent open airways to reduce hyperin /uniFB02 ation in patients with emphysema. The initial safety and clinical outcomes of this approach are promising and warrant further investigation. /H17039\nAuthor disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org.\nBreathe Study Group members: Anand Tana 1,2 , Arschang Valipour 3 , Alvin Ing 4 , Daniel P.
