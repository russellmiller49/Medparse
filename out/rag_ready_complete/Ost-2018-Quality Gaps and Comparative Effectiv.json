By the time patients are referred, some patients have had many thoracenteses over a short time span, which is inconsistent with guidelines. However, to our knowledge there are no large comparative effectiveness studies assessing the impact of practice pattern variations on outcomes from MPE. Most prior studies of MPE management were either surveys of pleurodesis methods, 10 comparative studies of methods to achieve pleurodesis, 11-13 or observational studies of quality of life after procedures. 3,14\nThe goal of this study was to compare practice patterns for recurrent MPEs to assess their impact on outcomes and to identify their determinants. We hypothesized that many patients receive multiple thoracenteses rather than having de /uniFB01 nitive pleural interventions as recommended by guidelines. We further hypothesized that a multiple thoracentesis strategy would result in more pleural procedures and complications.",

Exploratory outcomes included empyema (e-Appendix 1, e-Figure 1, e-Table 1).\nBecause hospitalization can occur for multiple reasons, we categorized inpatient stays based on when the procedure was done. If the pleural procedure was done within 2 days of admission, we considered the pleural disease as signi /uniFB01 cantly contributing to the hospitalization. If the pleural procedure occurred on the third day or later of hospitalization, these were considered late pleural procedures, and we did not count these days because presumably the patient was already in the hospital for another reason (e-Appendix 1). Because survival time would affect the number of procedures and the number of inpatient days (ie, you live longer, you have more chances to be in hospital and have procedures), we expressed these as incidence rates, dividing each by the total number of days alive.",

In a\n]\ncompeting risk model of second pleural procedures vs death as the competing risk, the cumulative incidence of death at 30 days was 14%, which was low relative to the number of patients needing a second pleural procedure (Fig 3). Among all patients who had a second procedure, median time from the /uniFB01 rst thoracentesis to the second procedure was 9 days (25%-75% IQR, 3-32 days). Patients with solid tumors metastatic to the lung were less likely than patients with primary lung cancer or lymphoma to require a second procedure ( P < .001) (Fig 4).\nThe second procedure was a thoracentesis in 10,019 (77%) patients and a de /uniFB01 nitive procedure in 2,948 patients (23%).

We therefore analyzed survival among the 12,967 patients that had a second pleural procedure with time zero being the time of the second procedure. If physicians were accurately predicting 30-day survival and recommending thoracentesis for patients with limited prognosis, then presumably survival would be lower in the thoracentesis group.

Using IPCs and thoracoscopic pleurodesis to treat recurrent MPEs was superior to chest tube pleurodesis in terms of limiting the need for future procedures; however, all these methods were superior to thoracentesis (Table 6). However, in terms of limiting the need for inpatient stay, thoracentesis and IPCs were equivalent, and both were superior to thoracoscopic or chest tube pleurodesis. This is important because we found that MPE had a large impact on health-care resource utilization, with 5% to 31% of all inpatient days being associated with pleural procedures. The study also provides additional insights into the determinants of practice patterns. We found that patient factors, physician factors, and system-level factors were associated with the probability of guideline consistent care.\nOur study is consistent with and builds on prior studies of MPEs by providing information on the comparative effectiveness of different practice patterns across a range\nof clinically relevant outcomes. 4,5 A recent Cochrane review of interventions for MPEs identi /uniFB01 ed three randomized controlled trials comparing thoracoscopic talc pleurodesis with talc slurry. 17-21 The primary outcome for that review was pleurodesis failure, de /uniFB01 ned using a hierarchy of preferences, with need for repeat pleural procedure being foremost. Thoracoscopic talc was estimated to be more successful than talc slurry via chest tube, but the evidence was not conclusive (Odds ratio (OR) for pleurodesis failure, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.13-1.19). Our results are similar in that we found that thoracoscopic pleurodesis was associated with fewer subsequent pleural procedures than chest tube pleurodesis (0.006 vs 0.016 procedures per day of life, respectively; relative risk, 0.38; P < .001).\nThe Cochrane review found insuf /uniFB01 cient data to perform network meta-analysis for important patient-centered outcomes, including hospital length of stay. 17,18 Our /uniFB01 nding that IPCs and thoracentesis are associated with fewer inpatient days due to pleural procedures per day of life than thoracoscopic or chest tube pleurodesis provides useful additional information in this area. No prior studies have, to our knowledge, evaluated total number of lifetime pleural procedures or inpatient hospital days associated with pleural procedures after MPE treatment. Because treatment of MPE is essentially palliative, eliciting patient preferences through discussion is an important aspect of management. Patient-centered outcomes, such as length of stay, are important factors to consider in this context\n]\nbecause management decisions will need to be individualized according to each patient ' s values and preferences. We think these data can be useful to help inform the decision process by making the trade-offs involved clearer.\nWe think sharing these data can also help address the quality gaps that are evident. Part of the reason for the low rate of guideline compliance may be that although physicians are aware that recurrence is common, they may be unaware of how fast it happens. We observed that 32% of patients with MPE had a second pleural procedure within 14 days of their /uniFB01 rst thoracentesis. Proper disease management requires knowledge of time to recurrence, which is a rate, rather than the simpler question of whether something will eventually recur, which is a proportion. If providers are not aware of the rapid rate, there is less urgency to arrange follow-up, for example 1-month follow-up might be considered as suf /uniFB01 cient, resulting in subsequent ED visits for dyspnea which could have been avoided.\nConsistent with physician knowledge being a determinant of whether guideline consistent care was delivered, we found that the specialty of the physician providing initial treatment of MPE was predictive of\nwhether guideline consistent care was provided in the future. The probability of future guideline consistent care was higher when initial treatment was provided by pulmonologists, thoracic surgeons, radiologists, and general surgeons than by ED and internal medicine physicians. Of note, our data do not provide insight into how interventional pulmonologists perform relative to other specialties because they are not classi /uniFB01 ed as a distinct specialty in the database. However, no specialty did particularly well (guideline consistency range, 14%-37%).\nThe data from this study also provide insight into how physician factors and system-level factors interact. This is highlighted by the association between site of service where the /uniFB01 rst pleural procedure was performed and whether guideline consistent care was provided in the future. Initial treatment in the ED was predictive of guideline consistent care during subsequent visits. This is interesting, given the concurrent /uniFB01 nding that having the /uniFB01 rst pleural procedure performed by an emergency physician was associated with a lower probability of guideline consistent care.\nWe think what this highlights is two different dimensions that both impact quality -physician training\na Subsequent procedures include all procedures beginning with the third procedure and later.\nb Chest tube pleurodesis vs thoracoscopy, P < .001; chest tube vs IPC, P < .001; chest tube vs thoracentesis, P < .001; and thoracentesis vs IPC, P < .001.\nDe /uniFB01 nitive procedures ¼ thoracoscopic pleurodesis, chest tube pleurodesis, or IPCs; IPC ¼ indwelling pleural catheter.\nand the organizational context within which care is provided. We think it is not the physician doing the /uniFB01 rst procedure that matters, but rather whether follow-up care is being arranged with a care team that is capable of performing timely de /uniFB01 nitive interventions. When an emergency physician does the procedure, this is just a risk marker that a good follow-up plan has not necessarily been put in place, because a pulmonary/ thoracic surgery referral probably was not made, because if it had been made that specialist probably would have done the /uniFB01 rst procedure. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that when the second physician was a specialist and was not the same as the /uniFB01 rst physician, guideline consistent care was more likely (e-Table 2). Also consistent with this hypothesis, we found no difference in per-procedure complication rates between guideline consistent and inconsistent groups. Therefore, it is not technical performance that is lacking, but rather recognition and referral to effective longitudinal disease management teams that needs improvement.\nSystem-based solutions to this problem will need to be locally designed. However, the data from this study can help identify the performance characteristics that solutions will require. Our data suggest systems will need to be able to handle a relatively high percentage of early recurrences and have readily available de /uniFB01 nitive procedures because roughly one-third of all patients will recur within the /uniFB01 rst 2 weeks.\nAlthough we think the data are useful in highlighting opportunities for improvement, it is also important to recognize its limits. Because this is SEER-Medicare data, one inherent limitation is that it does not distinguish\nbetween ipsilateral vs contralateral procedures. Therefore, some second procedures are no doubt occurring on the contralateral side. Our clinical data suggest that probably 10% to 14% of all second procedures are contralateral. In addition, repeat thoracentesis might have been because of patient preference or other valid reasons. We can conceive of circumstances when a second thoracentesis within 2 weeks would be appropriate, such as to obtain molecular markers or to provide terminal support at the end of life. Therefore, the true rate of guideline consistent care is probably higher than our data suggest. However, given that only 24% of patients received guideline consistent care, even if half of the other procedures were contralateral procedures or because of patient preference, the remaining quality gap would be substantial. Similarly, pneumothorax ex vacuo cannot be distinguished from other pneumothorax complications in our dataset. This might impact selection of subsequent treatments. However, the overall pneumothorax rate per procedure was similar in both groups and it was fairly low; therefore, even if all the pneumothoraxes were ex vacuo, this would not be suf /uniFB01 cient to explain the quality gap.\nIn addition, although the data can help to quantify changes in practice patterns and the consequences of those changes, we cannot determine the exact reason why these changes are occurring. As an example, similar to previously published reports, 22 we found that use of pleurodesis decreased over the period of the study. However, although previous studies did not measure IPC use, 22 we found that IPC utilization relative to chest tube and thoracoscopic pleurodesis increased from 2007\nAll patients had a /uniFB01 rst thoracentesis and malignant pleural effusion and had a subsequent recurrence. Subsequent procedures include all procedures beginning with the third procedure and above. See Table 5 legend for expansion of abbreviation.\na Nonparametric P < .001 for each category compared with thoracentesis group.\n]\nto 2011 (e-Table 4), such that use of de /uniFB01 nitive interventions overall was fairly stable. Whether this relative increase in IPC use was because of improved physician training, availability, patient preferences, an emphasis on keeping patients out of hospital, or system-based factors such as early specialist referral cannot be determined from the data.\nFinally, although inpatient days clearly have signi /uniFB01 cant economic and quality of life implications, attributing inpatient days to a diagnosis is dif /uniFB01 cult because patients are often hospitalized for multiple reasons. By counting only inpatient days in which a pleural procedure was done early, we tried to capture this attributable fraction. However, our de /uniFB01 nition of early pleural procedures (2 days) is such that a patient admitted on a Saturday that had a thoracentesis on Monday would be considered late, and the days for that admission would not be counted in the analysis. Arguably these would constitute real inpatient days related to pleural disease and should be counted. However, such a misclassi /uniFB01 cation would affects all groups in a proportional manner, such that each group would lose the same proportion of inpatient days. The consequence would be that the relative ratios between groups would be unchanged and correct, but the absolute difference in days between groups would decrease, favoring the null hypothesis. Therefore, our estimates of inpatient days are conservative in this regard. In addition, the /uniFB01 nding that ED procedures paralleled inpatient procedures supports our /uniFB01 ndings. However, although we think the observed association is valid, the magnitude of the effect is dif /uniFB01 cult to precisely quantify, and this should be kept in mind when interpreting the results.\nIn summary, we found that de /uniFB01 nitive pleural procedures were underused among patients that had rapid recurrence of MPEs. A strategy of repeat thoracentesis was associated with more future procedures, more complications, and more ED procedures. However, in terms of allowing patients to stay out of the hospital, thoracentesis and IPC were superior to thoracoscopic and chest tube pleurodesis. The public health burden from MPEs was signi /uniFB01 cant, with 5% to 31% of all subsequent inpatient days being associated with pleural procedures.\nTABLE 8\n]\nInpatient Days Associated With Early Pleural Procedures According to Pleural Procedure at Time of First Recurrence of Malignant Effusion\n(n\n¼\n12,967)\nValues are median (interquartile range) or as otherwise indicated.
