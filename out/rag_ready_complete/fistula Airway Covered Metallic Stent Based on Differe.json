The aim of this study was to assess the effect of airway stent insertion on MTEF patients. Methods: A total of 63 MTEF patients were included, 12 patients with lung cancer and 46 patients with esophageal cancers. Eight zones were proposed to classify various /uniFB01 stula locations. Airway stents were selected based on the various zones and /uniFB01 stula size. Results: Airway stents were successfully inserted in all patients, and both airway and esophageal stents in 8 patients. Most /uniFB01 stula were located in locations II (18/63, 28.6%), III (22/63, 34.9%), then VII (9/63, 14.3%). The stents included 10 (15.9%) I shaped, 8 (12.7%) L shaped and 45 (71.4%) Y shaped. Different stents were placed based on different locations and sizes of /uniFB01 stulas. Overall, mean survival time was 163 days (2 -270 days). Most symptoms relieved after stent insertion.

All patients (or their families) were informed about the procedures, possible results and complications.\nAll patients were not suitable to accept surgery due to illness severity, higher surgical risk or their refusal. These patients conformed to at least one of following criteria: (1) esophageal unsuitable for stenting; (2) respiratory complications due to esophageal stent only and (3) airway stenosis. The decision regarding airway stent placement was based on the location of the stenosis and esophageal peristalsis. From experiences one can /uniFB01 nd that if esophageal peristalsis is strong, the esophageal metallic stent is prone to move. Therefore, placement of the airway stent in these patients is preferable. Firstly, airway stent was inserted. If the /uniFB01 stula was not satisfactorily closed, another esophageal stent was implanted depending on the situation of esophagus.",

Seventeen patients received conventional radiotherapy. The demography and clinical data are listed in Table 1. All patients underwent airway stent insertion and 8 patients (12.7%) with both airway and esophageal stent insertion. Clinical manifestations of these patients before and after stent placement are listed in Table 3, including dyspnea (25 [39.7%] versus 2 [3.2%]; P 5 0.000), cough (63 [100%] versus 15 [23.8%]; P 5 0.000) and pulmonary infection (63 [100%] versus 10 [15.9%]; P 5 0.000). Mean KPS was 43.0 6 10.7 before stent placement and mean KPS was 66.7 6 10.8 after stent placement ( P 5 0.000) (Figure 2). Complete closure was achieved in 45 patients (71.4%), and incomplete closure and leakage were found in 18 patients. But stents were not removed in 18 patients due to the improvement of clinical manifestations.\nMost /uniFB01 stulas were located in location II (18/63, 28.6%), location III (22/63, 34.9%), then location VII (9/63, 14.3%).\nThe total number of airway stents was 63, including 10 (15.9%) I shaped, 8 (12.7%) L shaped and 45 (71.4%) Y shaped, as shown in Figures 3 and 4. Different stents were placed based on different locations and sizes of /uniFB01 stulas. Thirty-four Y-shaped stents were placed in the locations II and III.\nAll patients developed secretions adhered to the stents. Twenty-eight patients (44.5%) had chest pain and the airway stents were removed from 2 patients due to intolerable pain and the symptom relieved gradually in other patients within 2 weeks without any intervention. Two patients without stents were admitted into local hospitals and the authors were informed by\ntelephone that they died at 90 and 70 days after removing stents. Two patients developed stents migration at 3 and 4 days after the implantation and then stents were repositioned. Massive haemoptysis occurred in 2 patients with double stenting at 30 and 65 days. Both patients died within 2 days after the onset of bleeding. Airway restenosis occurred in 2 patients due to the progression of tumor at 60 and 85 days. They refused any further adjustment except supportive therapy until death.\nThe median survival time (from stent insertion to death) was 163 days (2 -270 days). The Kaplan -Meier survival curve of 63 patients after stenting is shown in Figure 5. The cause of death included the following: 2 patients by massive haemoptysis, 35 patients by malnutrition and cachexia, 17 by pneumonia and respiratory failure (17 included 2 patients whose stents were removed), 2 by acute myocardial infraction, 2 by airway restenosis and 5 by unclear reasons (3 patients died at home and 2 patients suffered from sudden death in hospital, but all families refused autopsy).",

      "content": "esophagus was widely used to relieve symptom in many reports. 8,13,14 When airway stenosis existed or when esophageal was not /uniFB01 t for stent planting because of previous surgery, stent should be placed /uniFB01 rstly in the airways under the bronchoscope or then both systems. 15 Airway stents were placed in all patients and 8 patients with double stenting in this study.\nClosure of the TEF can reduce the risk of aspiration pneumonia, relieve coughing and restore the patency of the passages with resumption of oral feeds. When /uniFB01 stula was closed, the symptom was relieved promptly. The clinical manifestations also improved immediately, even in 18 patients with incomplete closure, which may result from protecting lungs from continuous food contamination. 16 It is undoubted that stents serve as the bridge to improve the closure of /uniFB01 stula. Covered metallic stents were the most commonly used type in the literature, followed by Poly /uniFB02 ex stents and silicone stent. An analysis found that a covered metallic stent could achieve a better initial closure rate compared with other stent types. 17 Li et al 18 adopted 2 types of partially covered nitinol stents to treat MTEF, and initial /uniFB01 stula closure was obtained in 75% patients. A recent study reported that a /uniFB01 stula was successfully closed by combining a modi /uniFB01 ed silicon stent and metallic stents in a patient with carina TEF due to bronchial arterial infusion chemotherapy. Modi /uniFB01 ed Y-shaped silicon stent was made by the combination of 2 type stents in this study, therefore /uniFB01 stula closure was achieved in this patient. 19 Three shaped stents were applied in this study, and /uniFB01 stula closure was achieved in approximately 72% patients. Y-shaped stent conform to the airway anatomic structure in locations II, III, IV, V and VII.\nThe better attachment and radial forces could boost the seal of /uniFB01 stula effectively. However, sputum excretion was unsmooth and technique requirement was higher when using Y-shaped stent. L-shaped stents were mainly used in locations V, VI and VII in this study. I-shaped stent was mainly used for upper and middle airway-esophageal /uniFB01 stula, or bronchial /uniFB01 stula.\nThe size and location of /uniFB01 stula were closely associated with the prognosis of malignant patients with esophagorespiratory /uniFB01 stula when receiving stenting treatment. Unlike the uniformity of esophageal, the tracheal is divided into different parts, such as main tracheal, carina, right main tracheal and left main tracheal. Different locations have various physical parameters, such as inner diameter, pipe thickness and neighboring anatomic structure. Limited data were available for analysis of the stent type and the location of /uniFB01 stula. A recent study found that MTEF patients with stents placed in right main bronchus had a shorter survival time than those with stents in trachea. 20 In another previous study, 2 patients with carina MTEF were treated with covered self-expandable metallic stents, but incomplete closure and leakage were found in the patients. Therefore, authors suggested that Y stent should be the /uniFB01 rst choice for carina MTEF. 9 In addition, the small benign /uniFB01 stula could heal through routine therapy; however, even small malignant /uniFB01 stula generally could not self-cure, especially when patients were in poor nutrition condition. Therefore, it is reasonable to select different airway stents based on the location of trachea and size of /uniFB01 stula for MTEF patients.\nThe best palliation for malignant tracheoesophageal or bronchoesophageal /uniFB01 stula was achieved with endoscopic\nB\nplacement of esophageal, respiratory or esophagus and airway stenting. Dual stenting seemed to work better than single prosthesis for palliation, however, mechanical friction between the 2 devices may cause a breakdown of the interposed portion of the tracheobronchial wall. 21 Therefore, esophageal stent was only used for patients with an unsatisfactory closure through airway stent. Interventional bronchoscopic procedures, including balloon dilation, laser ablation, CO2 cryosurgery, electrocautery and implantation of airway stents, have been widely used to establish patent airway. 22 Rigid bronchoscopy under general anesthesia is also one common method of stent implantation. Most stents were implanted through bronchoscopy in this study. Generally, patients in this study had a similar survival time and complication rate, compared with previous studies. 16,20",
