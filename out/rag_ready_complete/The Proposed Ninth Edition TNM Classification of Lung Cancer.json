This article summarizes the analyses and revisions for the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation of lung cancer to familiarize the broader medical community and facilitate implementation of the ninth edition system.\nStage classi /uniFB01 cation is a cornerstone of managing patients with cancer by providing a universal, consistent nomenclature about the anatomic extent of disease. This enables reliable communication and promotes assessment of the applicability of clinical trial results to an individual patient ' s tumor. TNM classi /uniFB01 cation applies to a tumor (ie, the anatomic extent). The patient has many other characteristics that are explicitly not part of stage classi /uniFB01 cation. TNM classi /uniFB01 cation is not a prognostic model, as many patient-, setting-, and treatment-\nrelated factors also affect prognosis. Finally, treatment is not determined by the nomenclature of stage; this merely enables communication. Clinical studies de /uniFB01 ne the role of treatment strategies; these are constantly evolving and include many factors besides anatomic tumor extent.\nA nomenclature must remain consistent and stable over time. Nevertheless, advances in imaging and treatment reveal new aspects to be clinically relevant. An organized, formal process is used to\nABBREVIATIONS: AJCC = American Joint Committee on Cancer; GG = ground-glass; GG/L = ground- glass/lepidic; IASLC = International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer; LCAL = lung cancer with air lucency; SPFC = Staging and Prognostic Factors Committee; STAS = spread though air spaces; UICC = Union for International Cancer Control; VPI = visceral pleural invasion\nAFFILIATIONS: From the Division of Thoracic Surgery (F.

This involves an international multidisciplinary committee (the Staging and Prognostic Factors Committee [SPFC]), a large global database, and extensive statistical analysis (e-Fig 1). 1 The SPFC encompasses domains of thoracic malignancies (lung, thymic, mesothelioma, and esophageal), with multiple subcommittees focused on speci /uniFB01 c aspects of TNM.

      "content": "The TNM system consists of three components: T for primary tumor extent, N for lymph node involvement, and M for distant metastases. Each T, N, and M component is divided into several categories (eg, T1, T2) and subcategories (eg, T1a, T1b). Various characteristics, known as descriptors, de /uniFB01 ne what is included within a T, N, or M category. Combinations of T, N, and M categories are clustered together into stage groups.\nA pre /uniFB01 x speci /uniFB01 es the context of TNM classi /uniFB01 cation (Table 1). Clinical stage (c) refers to the /uniFB01 nal pretreatment stage (based on symptoms, physical signs, imaging, and biopsy results gathered within 4 months of diagnosis). 2 Pathologic stage (p) is de /uniFB01 ned according to the results of a surgical resection together with all clinical staging information (and, per AJCC, imaging deemed necessary following resection). Once established, the\nTNM classi /uniFB01 cation is de /uniFB01 nitive for the speci /uniFB01 c context and must remain unchanged. The term presumptive or preliminary stage describes stage as it iteratively evolves during the process of patient evaluation.\nUnfortunately, the p-pre /uniFB01 x is often loosely applied to T and N components with a different meaning, namely that biopsy material is available (without resection). AJCC/UICC restrict use of pT and pN to a surgical resection (with rare exceptions). 2,3 AJCC explicitly de /uniFB01 nes microscopic assessment of T and N during diagnostic workup as cT and cN. 2 Rare exceptions when a pathologic designation is permitted without resection involve extensive tumors, are described differently by AJCC and UICC, and leave aspects unde /uniFB01 ned or ambiguous (e-Appendix 1). 2,3 Therefore, IASLC recommends that the p-pre /uniFB01 x not be applied to individual components outside the context of surgical resection. 4",

For the latter, the highest level of assessment used is applied to the entire stage (eg, T2bN2aM0 E3a if endobronchial ultrasoundtransbronchial aspiration was used to de /uniFB01 ne the N status). This assumes that managing clinicians used the highest level of evaluation for the component that was most critical in establishing the correct stage.

Geographically, 56% came from Asia/Australia, 25% from Europe, 16% from North America, 3.4% from South/Central America, and 0.1% from Africa/Middle East. Individual analyses imposed speci /uniFB01 c criteria; overall, for c- and p-stages, 58,193 and 39,192 cases were available for stage group analyses, 33,982 and 30,715 for T component analyses, 45,032 and 35,009 for N component analyses, and 14,937 (c-stage only) for M component analyses, respectively. 5-8 Separate con /uniFB01 rmatory analyses of the proposed revisions were performed for small cell and carcinoid tumors of the lung.\nWhen the T category and stage group were determined by the primary tumor size, the eighth edition de /uniFB01 nitions were used whenever available (ie, solid [c-stage] or invasive [p-stage] component size).

Following discussions within each subcommittee and the entire SPFC, the de /uniFB01 nitions shown in Table 3 7 were selected. This involved no changes to the T component, subdivision of N2 (into N2a with metastasis to a single station and N2b to multiple N2 stations), and subdivision of M1c (into M1c1 with multiple metastases in a single organ system and M1c2 involving multiple organ systems).\nT Categories: The T descriptors primarily involve increasing size, or increasing invasion peripherally (eg, visceral pleura, chest wall) or centrally (eg, main bronchus, carina). 6 When multiple T descriptors are applicable to a tumor, the highest T category is chosen. The size measurement is de /uniFB01 ned by the largest dimension of the solid component (on imaging, c-stage) or the invasive component (on microscopy, p-stage). 9 The size of a ground-glass (GG) or lepidic component is not counted.\nThe solid component size is measured on thin CT scan images ( # 1.5 mm) using lung windows, although mediastinal windows can be useful to evaluate changes in density over time. 11 Generally, axial images are suf /uniFB01 cient, but multiplanar images can be used if deemed to better represent the largest tumor dimension. 11 If there are several solid components, the size of the largest solid portion is used. 9 Microscopically, the largest dimension of the invasive component is used; any adjacent spread through air spaces (STAS) is not counted. 9,12 Rarely, when pathologic measurement is problematic and deemed inaccurate, using the clinical measurement as the pT size is recommended. 3,9,13\nA Pancoast tumor is classi /uniFB01 ed as T3 if it involves thoracic (ie, T1 or T2) nerve roots, the stellate ganglion, or the chest wall (ribs or soft tissue). It is classi /uniFB01 ed as T4 if it involves vertebral bodies, the spinal canal, subclavian vessels, cervical nerve roots, or components of the brachial plexus. 7\nN Categories: Various potential revisions were considered, including a shift to the number of node stations, zones, and hybrid approaches. 5 The analyses supported maintaining the traditional categories by anatomic location but subdividing N2 into single vs multiple station involvement (Table 3). Speci /uniFB01 cally, consistent ordering and discrimination were shown in multiple cohorts: R0, R-any, T1, T2, T3, and T4, and in pairwise comparisons of adjacent (sub)categories and by multivariable regression. Generalizability was veri /uniFB01 ed across time periods, histotypes, geographic regions, source data types, and treatment approaches. 5 Consistent ordering and discrimination were seen in both c- and p-stage analyses (not previously feasible for p-stage).\nThe ninth edition classi /uniFB01 cation highlights the need for thorough clinical assessment and reporting, as well as thorough preoperative and intra-operative node evaluation. If no nodes are assessed, the NX designation applies. The data granularity was insuf /uniFB01 cient to assess which imaging modalities or biopsy techniques were used or the thoroughness thereof. Nevertheless, the consistent survival differences observed in a large global database provide evidence of real-life applicability (although the analysis excluded cases without suf /uniFB01 cient information about the number and sites of node involvement).\nThe ninth edition N classi /uniFB01 cation underscores the value of consistent de /uniFB01 nitions of node stations. No changes are recommended to the lung cancer node map (Fig 1).\nM Categories: The M subcommittee explored several issues, including assessments of metastatic burden (size, number of lesions, and/or sites), impact of speci /uniFB01 c metastatic sites, and a de /uniFB01 nition of oligometastatic disease. 8 The distinction of M1a, M1b, and M1c remained consistent in the ninth edition database. The prognostic impact of a pleural effusion deemed to be malignant was similar regardless of whether it was cytologically proven (this does not include effusions believed to be benign). A size threshold for the largest metastasis could not be de /uniFB01 ned with suf /uniFB01 cient consistency. The impact of speci /uniFB01 c metastatic sites (eg, brain, adrenal, bone) was also inconsistent. Investigation of permutations of the number of lesions and metastatic organ sites suggested that the most robust categorization involved four categories (Table 3): M1a (intrathoracic metastases), M1b (single extrathoracic metastasis), M1c1 (multiple metastases in a single organ system), and M1c2 (multiple metastases in multiple organ systems). 8",

Although some potential confounders were shown to have little impact (eg, metastatic site), others could not be adequately assessed (eg, comorbidities, treatment details).

These groups were not consistently distinct in all analyses; detailed investigation of potential reasons or confounders was not performed. It was deemed that distinguishing M1b and M1c1 should be maintained, based on lack of clear evidence to the contrary, the historical precedent, and a clinical consensus that views a solitary metastasis differently than multiple metastases. Similarly, in some subgroups, the separation of M1a and M1b was minimal. However, distinguishing these categories is maintained in the ninth edition for the same reasons.",

This topic encompasses four entities that represent different disease processes with different biological behavior (e-Fig 5, Table 4 17 ). It is crucial to distinguish these; criteria that de /uniFB01 ne this are provided in e-Tables 3 to 6. 17-20\nSynchronous second primary lung cancers are not rare. The clinical characteristics (ie, presentation, imaging) and biological behavior (ie, outcomes, recurrence patterns) for each tumor are similar to that of single ' typical ' lung cancers (ie, solid, spiculated). 19 Most second primary lung cancers have the same histotype and may have similar biomarker patterns. This means histotype and biomarker patterns alone are not entirely reliable to classify two tumors as separate primary or related tumors; clinical information and imaging appearance are crucial components. Subsequent outcomes generally con /uniFB01 rm a clinical assessment that two tumors are synchronous primary lung cancers. 19 Second primary lung cancers should be designated with a T, N, and M category for each tumor.\nSome patients with a solid primary lung cancer have one or more solid separate tumor nodule(s) of the same histotype. The mechanism by which they arise is unclear. These tumors are classi /uniFB01 ed according to the location of the separate nodule relative to the index tumor (T3 for same-lobe, T4 for ipsilateral different lobe, and M1a for contralateral lobe) with a single N and M category. 18\nHowever, when resected, outcomes are equally good for T3, T4, and M1a separate tumor nodules, only slightly lower than those of similar tumors without a separate tumor nodule. 18 Although distinguishing synchronous primary cancers and a separate tumor nodule can be dif /uniFB01 cult, the same management is generally warranted (aggressive treatment of each lesion), and subsequent outcomes are also similar.\nThe most common disease pattern involving multiple pulmonary sites is that of multiple GG nodules. This group has different demographic characteristics, excellent outcomes, and infrequent nodal or extrathoracic recurrences. 20 Most of these lesions do not progress over 5 to 10 years. 21,22 The T category of these GG/L tumors is the solid/invasive size of the highest T lesion with multiplicity indicated by the number or ' m ' in parentheses and a collective N and M category for all [eg, T1a(m)N0M0]. This multifocal adenocarcinoma entity is readily recognized by imaging; a detailed histologic assessment of each GG/L tumor nodule is unecessary. 20\nA less common pattern of lung cancer appears radiologically similar to pneumonia (so-called ' pneumonic-type ' lung cancer). Extrathoracic involvement is infrequent, but prognosis is distinctly worse than for the other entities exhibiting multiple pulmonary sites of lung cancer. 20 Diffuse pneumonictype lung cancers are designated by size, or, when size measurement is dif /uniFB01 cult, T3 if in one lobe, T4 if involving multiple ipsilateral lobes, and M1a if involving both lungs with a single N and M category for all areas of involvement.\nRecently, lung cancer with air lucency (LCAL) has emerged as another pattern of disease with frequent multiple pulmonary sites of involvement. 23 Progression of LCAL is often indolent, but sometimes rapid acceleration occurs, especially when a solid component develops. Progression is associated with frequent nodal involvement and a poor prognosis. TNM classi /uniFB01 cation of LCAL has not been of /uniFB01 cially addressed. We suggest that TNM classi /uniFB01 cation be done similar to multifocal GG/L adenocarcinoma, with T de /uniFB01 ned by the solid component of the largest lesion and (#/m) to indicate multiplicity, and a single N and M.",

      "content": "R Status: The classi /uniFB01 cation of resection completeness as R0 (complete), R1 (microscopically positive resection margin), and R2 (gross unresected tumor) is /uniFB01 rmly embedded in the AJCC/UICC classi /uniFB01 cation. Lung cancer\n[\n]\nalso includes an uncertain category [R(un)], in which the presence of residual tumor or the prognostic implication is uncertain (e-Fig 6, Table 5). 4,24 Validation studies have con /uniFB01 rmed progressively lower survival for R0 vs R(un) vs R1 vs R2 (R1 and R2 are sometimes less clearly distinct, perhaps due to R2 sample size). 24\nTwo uncertain category descriptors are labeled R0(un), involving negative margins but a limited lymph node evaluation or the highest node station assessed was positive. Multiple studies have shown that limited node assessment is associated with lower survival. 24 IASLC de /uniFB01 nes a full assessment as six or more node stations,\nAIS ¼ adenocarcinoma in situ; GG/L ¼ ground-glass/lepidic; LPA ¼ lepidic-predominant adenocarcinoma; MIA ¼ minimally invasive adenocarcinoma. (Reprinted with permission from Detterbeck et al. 17 )\nincluding the subcarinal and two or more other mediastinal stations and hilar/lobar stations. IASLC counts stations invasively assessed either preoperatively or intra-operatively, as well as a documented absence of nodes in a station. 4,24 Subdivision of the N2 category and the shift to sublobar resection highlight the importance of careful node assessment. The American Cancer Society 2020 Operative Standard calls for sampling of three or more mediastinal stations and one hilar station. 25 However, some data suggest that the bene /uniFB01 t associated with more thorough node evaluation is not seen in small GG tumors. 26\nThe R(un) category also includes carcinoma in situ at the bronchial margin and when a pleural lavage was performed and its /uniFB01 ndings were cytologically positive. 4,24 These are designated as R1 (as de /uniFB01 ned by the UICC) 13 with the addition of (is þ ) and (cy þ ), respectively, to distinguish them from a standard positive margin or malignant pleural effusion. Pleural lavage has been studied extensively (a meta-analysis included 28 studies and > 20,000 patients), 27 but it is seldom practiced outside of Japan. Pleural lavage cytology is positive in approximately 5% of patients, which correlates consistently with lower survival and higher recurrence rates following adjustment for confounders. 24 However, pleural recurrence accounts for only approximately 30% of recurrences.\nA macroscopically complete resection in the face of a malignant pleural effusion or nodules is designated as an R1 resection. Although such patients generally do not undergo resection, in those who do, 5-year survival rates of approximately 20% are reported consistently. 24\nWhen a resection involves several R descriptors, the highest applicable R category is used. IASLC recommends using the R classi /uniFB01 cation only in the context of a surgical resection and not consider expansion to describe response to nonsurgical treatment modalities. 4,24\nIASLC recommends applying the R classi /uniFB01 cation to any site of resection (primary tumor, nodes, pleural nodules, or an extrathoracic metastasis). 4,24 The site of resection should be recorded (eg, R0 [thorax] or R0 [adrenal]). In addition, the R classi /uniFB01 cation applies to a speci /uniFB01 c surgical procedure, and it does not count tumor in another site that is to be addressed separately (perhaps with another treatment modality). Recording the site of resection (eg, R0 [thorax]) and the M category communicates the completeness of a speci /uniFB01 c resection and acknowledges remaining tumor at another site. This approach can\naccommodate separate management steps, as well as a combination of treatment modalities, and can communicate the completeness of a speci /uniFB01 c step, all of which are important aspects with the increasing use of de /uniFB01 nitive local therapy for oligometastatic disease.\nAdditional Histologic Descriptors: The TNM system includes several additional histologic descriptors; however, only visceral pleural invasion (VPI) affects stage classi /uniFB01 cation. Both invasion through the pleural elastic layer (PL1) and extension to the visceral pleural surface (PL2) are counted as VPI. In the eighth and ninth edition analyses, VPI had prognostic impact in small tumors, justifying the T2 designation. 6,28 The eighth edition analysis also suggested a prognostic impact for VPI in each larger tumor category and a gradation between PL1 and PL2, but these observations do not affect the T category.\nThe term STAS refers to a microscopic observation of tumor cells adjacent to a lung cancer (median, 11.5 mm). 29-31 A detailed ninth edition analysis con /uniFB01 rms that STAS is a consistent independent negative prognostic factor, regardless of histotype or resection extent. 12 Nevertheless, STAS does not affect tumor size measurement or the T category.\nOther histologic features include lymphatic invasion (L), vascular invasion (V), and lymphangitic carcinomatosis (Ly, which may be adjacent to the tumor, lobar, or more diffuse). 3,4 These features do not affect the T category; their association with worse prognosis is not entirely consistent. 12\nMinimal Disease Manifestations: The AJCC/UICC de /uniFB01 ne micrometastases in nodes or distant sites as small deposits of tumor cells ( > 0.2-2 mm) detected by routine hematoxylin-eosin staining. Micrometastases are counted toward N and M categories with the additional symbol (mi) [eg, N2(mi)]. 2,4,32 Isolated tumor cells are isolated cells or small clumps of tumor cells # 0.2 mm, mostly only detected using special techniques. Isolated tumor cells do not count toward the N or M categories, 2,4 and their prognostic signi /uniFB01 cance is unclear. Circulating tumor cells (isolated tumor cells in blood, typically detected by special staining techniques) are denoted as cM0(i þ ); they do not affect the TNM designation. Other blood-based assessments, such as cell-free tumor DNA, are not included in the TNM system.",

      "content": "The seventh edition TNM classi /uniFB01 cation of lung cancer was dramatically different by involving a database 20\n[\n]\ntimes larger than ever before, an international multidisciplinary team, and extensive statistical analyses. 33 Nevertheless, changes were relatively minor, consisting primarily of adding three size thresholds to the T component. The eighth edition involved a similarly large database, team, and analysis, this time resulting in a major overhaul of the T component, subdividing in 1-cm increments and reallocating many descriptors. 34 The N component remained unchanged in both of these revisions.\nIn the ninth edition, the T component is minimally re /uniFB01 ned, but the N component is signi /uniFB01 cantly altered. The general evolution of awareness and detailed node assessment has allowed relevant subcategories to emerge that affect clinical management. Increased data granularity permitted exploration of fundamentally different approaches to the N component, including the /uniFB01 nal proposal to subdivide N2 into N2a and N2b. In addition, this led to classi /uniFB01 cation of T1N2aM0 as stage IIB (instead of IIIA as in the eighth edition).\nThe M component was divided into M1a and M1b in the seventh edition; M1a, M1b, and M1c in the eighth edition; and now M1a, M1b, M1c1, and M1c2 in the ninth edition. A larger cohort of M1 tumors in the ninth edition allowed exploration of several aspects, including a de /uniFB01 nition of oligometastatic disease appropriate for aggressive local therapy. The analysis shows that oligometastatic burden is a continuum without a clear in /uniFB02 ection threshold, best left as a matter of clinical trials and judgment.\nThe /uniFB01 eld of lung cancer has evolved signi /uniFB01 cantly. Effective treatment was once largely limited to surgical resection and early-stage tumors. All treatment modalities have advanced, and multimodality treatment is increasingly used across the spectrum of tumor extent: systemic therapy in early stage and local therapy in advanced stages. This creates an increased focus on anatomic tumor extent in advanced stages (ie, higher N and M categories).\nAlthough anatomic characteristics are instrumental for local therapies, nonanatomic tumor-related factors are important for systemic therapies (eg, presence/absence of driver mutations, PD-L1 expression). Such factors are already used in individual patient care. However, a system is needed that organizes nonanatomic factors, thereby providing a structure for databases, analysis, and communication, similar to what TNM has provided for anatomic factors. Challenges in developing this include the rapidity of advances, the mixture of prognostic and predictive factors, and multiplicity of lines of treatment.\nA classi /uniFB01 cation system for nonanatomic tumor-related factors that complements TNM would be a component of a prognostic model. An accurate prognostic model would need to account for the impact of many additional patient-, setting-, and treatment-related factors. We need to clarify what would be most useful: a model for a large group or individualized patient-speci /uniFB01 c prediction (as well as determining which outcome to address). Inherent challenges in developing a model include: predictions based on past data do not include present-day advances, revalidation is needed whenever new factors are added, and uncertainty (eg, random events) cannot be eliminated (furthermore, the more individualized the prediction, the greater the uncertainty).\nThe TNM classi /uniFB01 cation cannot be expected to appropriately address the complexity of nonanatomic tumor-related factors or to be a comprehensive prognostic model. Efforts to meet these needs are ongoing. TNM is purely a classi /uniFB01 cation of anatomic tumor extent; this does not diminish the tremendous impact it has had over decades in facilitating care delivery and clinical research.\nWhat implications will the new TNM classi /uniFB01 cation have on daily practice? It is important to recognize that changing nomenclature (eg, IIB in the ninth vs IIIA in the eighth edition for T1N2aM0) does not change the data we have from clinical studies of outcomes and the effectiveness of speci /uniFB01 c treatments. Furthermore, although the increased granularity of the ninth edition highlights the impact of details of tumor extent, the observations were observed fairly consistently in a global real-life collective of patients managed as deemed appropriate during the past decade. Further nuances of how to optimally manage patients will undoubtedly emerge from ongoing research, enhanced and stimulated by the granularity of the ninth edition TNM classi /uniFB01 cation.",

      "content": "The process of re /uniFB01 ning the ninth edition of the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation of lung cancer is nearly complete; only formal adoption and implementation remain. The changes include clarifying details but most prominently involve subdivision of the N2 and M1c categories and reorganization of the TNM combinations included in stage groups IIA, IIB, IIIA, and IIIB. The current article also summarizes the extensive, multitiered analyses underlying these changes, which provide con /uniFB01 dence in the consistency of discrimination and generalizability of the ninth edition classi /uniFB01 cation.\nChanges in what is meant by the rede /uniFB01 ned stage groups mostly affects analyses of databases and large patient populations. At a TNM level (what is needed in individual care delivery), implementation should be straightforward because the changes are readily backwards compatible. Changes in stage group nomenclature do not change the data we have about outcomes for patients with tumors of a particular T, N, and M extent. The universal language that TNM provides regarding anatomic extent has been made more granular, hopefully facilitating patient care.\nBy circulating this summary of the analyses and de /uniFB01 nitions of the ninth edition TNM classi /uniFB01 cation of lung cancer, we hope to promote familiarity and ease the transition to implementation of the system in 2025.",
