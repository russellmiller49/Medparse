      "content": "Accurate evaluation of lymph node (LN) metastasis is a key component in cancer staging, which allows clinicians to communicate effectively, provide standard treatments, assess prognosis, and perform clinical trials. 1 Since the N descriptor of the TNM staging system for Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was de /uniFB01 ned as N0, N1, N2, and N3 in 1987 in the fourth edition, 2 this classi /uniFB01 cation has remained unchanged. 3 -5 Nevertheless, these four categories are based solely on the anatomical location of metastatic LNs and do not consider disease burden quanti /uniFB01 cation. Thus, questions have consistently been raised about this nodal classi /uniFB01 cation system not adequately re /uniFB02 ecting the burden of metastatic LNs, which is known to be a prognostic factor for many other solid malignancies. 6\nSubsequently, this concept of disease quanti /uniFB01 cation was /uniFB01 rst evaluated in the seventh edition of the TNM staging system for lung cancer and re-explored in the eighth edition by subclassifying according to the number\n*Corresponding author.\nAddress for correspondence: Jae Kwang Yun, MD, PhD, Department of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, Asan Medical Center, Ulsan University College of Medicine, 88 Olympic-ro 43-gil, Songpa-gu, Seoul 05505, Republic of Korea.

Nevertheless, an apparent gap still exists, in that the study lacks detailed information on patient history or comorbidities that might affect survival outcomes. In addition, this study lacked information on recurrence or progression and did not include the relevant survival analyses, which are important for interpreting oncological outcomes. Thus, there is a need for external validation of the new N descriptors proposed by the IASLC in a large, independent, single-center database.\nOur study aimed to evaluate the discriminatory ability and prognostic performance of the proposed N classi /uniFB01 cation in the ninth edition of the TNM staging system based on a large, independent cohort.",

In cases of borderline tumor size or metabolic uptake of mediastinal LNs on CT or PET, biopsies of the involved LNs were selectively conducted with mediastinoscopy, endobronchial ultrasound, or endoscopic ultrasound. Until 2010, before the introduction of endobronchial ultrasound, mediastinoscopy was performed to con /uniFB01 rm N2 or N3 nodes. Subsequently, endobronchial ultrasound was primarily used to identify LN metastasis instead of mediastinoscopy. After surgery, adjuvant therapy was provided if indicated.

Given that the purpose of this study was validation, the variables included in the Cox regression model were selected as suggested by the IASLC SPFC. Furthermore, because the study period was long and improvements in diagnostic and treatment modalities over time may affect survival, we added the year of surgery as a factor to the /uniFB01 nal COX regression model.

      "content": "The /uniFB01 ndings of this study revealed the clinical relevance of the newly proposed N descriptor of the ninth edition TNM staging system with patients who underwent curative surgery for Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We found a clear and consistent prognostic difference between subgroups of patients with N2 disease, namely those with N2a and N2b. In addition, N2a status was associated with worse survival than N1 status, which allowed for a much clearer prognostic separation between all categories compared with that with the eighth edition N classi /uniFB01 -cation. The differences between all categories, both clinical and pathologic, remained statistically signi /uniFB01 cant even after adjustment for various cofactors. Moreover, using detailed information from a single large cohort, we validated the clinical utility of the ninth edition N descriptor for RFS and OS.\nThe N classi /uniFB01 cation of lung cancer is exclusively determined by the anatomical location of the LNs and has no concept of disease burden. Nevertheless, over the years, many studies have reported the disease burden of metastatic LNs and heterogeneity in the N1 and N2 categories. 7,8,13,14 To improve the prognostic discrimination ability based on nodal status, exploratory analyses have been performed before each TNM classi /uniFB01 cation revision. In the seventh edition analysis, disease burden of metastatic LNs at the N1 and N2 levels was evaluated by subdividing into single and multiple LN zones. This categorizing of LN stations into LN zones was introduced to reconcile discrepancies between the MD-ATS and Naruke-Japanese LN maps. 4,10,15 Although the results of this analysis revealed prognostic differences between adjacent N categories, small sample sizes precluded validation of each N category across T categories. In the eighth edition analysis, the disease burden of involved LNs was evaluated according to the number of metastatic LN stations, single versus multiple, and the presence of ' skip ' metastases. Although the pathologic N\nclassi /uniFB01 cation was observed to have prognostic ability, there was no difference in survival between the N1b and N2a1 categories, and the N1b and N2a2 survival curves overlapped. Furthermore, most of the information for pathologic N status was derived from Japan, and there was still dichotomization of LN maps among the collected data. 5\nConsidering these limitations, this classi /uniFB01 cation was re-evaluated with the ninth edition database, which included a larger and more detailed data set obtained through the Electronic Data Capture and adoption of the IASLC LN map as the accepted standard. 16 Nevertheless, there was a still lack of clear separation between adjacent categories. Furthermore, the N2a1 category had no survival difference compared with adjacent categories, increasing the complexity of the staging system. Finally, the IASLC concluded that the proposal did not suf /uniFB01 -ciently stratify prognostic groups in either clinical or pathologic staging. Nevertheless, clearer prognostic separation between categories was observed when the N1 category was retained and N2 was subdivided on the basis of single (N2a) and multiple (N2b) stations. 9\nIn this study, a signi /uniFB01 cant survival difference was observed in terms of pathologic staging between N1a and N1b (Hazard ratio (HR) Â¼ 1.65, p < 0.001 for OS) (Table 3), which has been consistently reported in other studies including the ninth edition data set. 5,7 -9 Nevertheless, the difference between N1a and N1b no longer remained signi /uniFB01 cant when it was applied to clinical staging (Hazard ratio (HR) Â¼ 1.05, p Â¼ 0.758 for OS) (Table 3), which is similar to the results of the survival analysis by the IASLC that used the ninth edition data set. 9 Previously, the IASLC de /uniFB01 ned the threshold for considering alternative changes in revising the N classi /uniFB01 cation of lung cancer, noting that the ordering of prognostic differences should be maintained in clinical and pathologic staging. 1 This means that clinical N descriptors should be achievable and reasonably capable of discriminating prognosis, regardless of surgical or nonsurgical treatment, even though the magnitude of the difference between survival curves may differ between clinical and pathologic staging. In fact, it is dif /uniFB01 cult to distinguish and con /uniFB01 rm the number of involved N1 LN stations using radiologic and invasive clinical staging procedures. 5,9,17 Thus, we agree with the IASLC ' s proposal to simply retain the N1 category without separating it into N1a and N1b in the ninth edition N classi /uniFB01 cation.\nSimilarly, it is reasonable to consolidate into simpler singleversus multiple-station metastasis categories (N2a and N2b) without separating according to the ' skip ' metastasis (N2a1 and N2a2). Various studies have revealed that the N2a1 category does not have any considerable survival differences compared with adjacent categories, which increases the complexity of the staging system. 4,5,7 -9 The same result was obtained in\nour study, where there was no signi /uniFB01 cant survival difference between the N1b and N2a1 ( p Â¼ 0.838 for OS) categories. Nevertheless, when N2a1 and N2a2 were combined into N2a in the ninth edition of the TNM staging system, we detected much clearer prognostic separations between all categories (N0, N1, N2a, and N2b) in terms of both clinical and pathologic staging. Notably, in contrast to the N1 category, splitting the N2 category into the N2a and N2b categories was clinically relevant in clinical staging. This is because it is relatively easier to distinguish the number of involved N2 LN stations than that of N1 nodes through imaging tests or invasive staging procedures.\nThe multivariable Cox proportional hazards model revealed considerable differences between N categories of the ninth edition classi /uniFB01 cation in terms of both clinical and pathologic staging after adjusting for age, sex, histology, comorbidity, and year of surgery. The subgroup analyses survival curves were consistently observed in the order of N descriptors, although some differences between N categories were not statistically signi /uniFB01 cant. Excluding those between the N2a and N2b categories in the T4 subgroup, differences in 5-year survival rates between N categories were consistently observed to be greater than 5%, revealing that the prognostic discriminatory ability is well maintained even across subgroups. Consequently, the ninth edition N classi /uniFB01 cation appropriately re /uniFB02 ected the long-standing requirement of integrating a measure of disease burden into the solely location-based system. Moreover, this system did not disrupt the eighth edition classi /uniFB01 cation and is backward compatible. Most importantly, the survival differences between these subgroups were consistent across clinical and pathologic classi /uniFB01 cations, which may facilitate greater precision from radiologists, practitioners involved in invasive staging procedures, surgeons, and pathologists.\nWe acknowledge that this study has several limitations. First, information and selection biases are inevitable in a single-center, retrospective study, although the data used in this study were collected prospectively in our database. Second, there was no survival analysis for clinical or pathologic N3 subgroup patients -this study included only patients who underwent surgical treatment, and patients with clinical or pathologic N3 could not be included due to their rarity. Third, patients who underwent neoadjuvant therapy were excluded from this study. Surgical resection after neoadjuvant therapy has become the preferred approach in cases of advanced lung cancer in many institutions. The use of immunotherapy or target agents is also rapidly increasing, and the neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy paradigm is rapidly developing. 18,19 Given this trend, even though the proposed N classi /uniFB01 cation was found to have prognostic discrimination ability in the ninth edition data set, 9 it will be necessary to\nexternally validate whether it retains this ability for patients who undergo neoadjuvant therapy. Fourth, performance status and mutation markers are known to be associated with the prognosis of lung cancer. Nevertheless, given the retrospective nature of this study and incomplete data, we could not add these factors to the Cox regression model. Fifth, as only patients who underwent surgical treatment were included in this analysis, the results could differ from those of the overall Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient population. Finally, our study has a relatively small sample size compared with the IASLC ninth edition data set. Therefore, it may lack statistical power, especially when the N categories are subdivided, as the classi /uniFB01 cation proposed by Asamura et al. In addition, the sample size for various subgroup analyses was relatively small; although there might be clinical differences, statistically signi /uniFB01 cant differences might not be observed.\nIn summary, we validated the clinical utility of the ninth edition N classi /uniFB01 cation for both clinical and pathologic stages in Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The newly proposed N classi /uniFB01 -cation revealed clear prognostic separation between all categories (N0, N1, N2a, and N2b) in terms of RFS and OS. Thus, it is expected to provide key insights into the heterogeneity of nodal involvement and facilitate the evolution of adequate treatment-related decisions.",
