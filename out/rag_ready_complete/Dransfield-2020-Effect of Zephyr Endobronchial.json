Methods: A total of 190 patients with severe heterogeneous emphysema and little to no collateral ventilation in the target lobe were randomized 2:1 to the Zephyr Valve or standard of care. Changes in PROs at 12 months in the two groups were compared: dyspnea with the Transitional Dyspnea Index (TDI), focal score; the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Assessment Test (CAT; breathlessness on hill/stairs); Borg; the EXAcerbations of Chronic pulmonary disease Tool -PRO, dyspnea domain; activity with the TDI, magnitude of task/effort/functional impairment, CAT (limited activities), and the St. George ' s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), activity domain; and psychosocial status with the SGRQ, impacts domain, and CAT (con /uniFB01 dence and energy). Results: At 12 months, patients using the Zephyr Valve achieved statistically signi /uniFB01 cant and clinically meaningful improvements in the SGRQ; CAT; and the TDI, focal score, compared with standard of care. Improvements in the SGRQ were driven by the impacts and activity domains ( P , 0.05 and P , 0.001, respectively). Reduction in CAT was through improvements in breathlessness ( P , 0.05), energy level ( P , 0.05), activities ( P , 0.001), and increased con /uniFB01 dence when leaving home ( P , 0.05). The TDI measures of effort, task, and functional impairment were uniformly improved ( P , 0.001). The EXAcerbations of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool (EXACT) -PRO, dyspnea domain, was signi /uniFB01 cantly improved in the Zephyr Valve group. Improvements correlated with changes in residual volume and residual volume/TLC ratio.

Progression of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with worsening breathlessness accompanied by a downward spiral of symptom-induced inactivity (3), muscle deconditioning and weakness (4), and signi /uniFB01 cant negative impact on health-related quality of life and survival (5 -8).\nThe emphysema-hyperin /uniFB02 ated phenotype is characterized by a heightened sense of dyspnea and exercise intolerance caused by mechanical constraints imposed on ventilation at rest and during activity (9). The physiological model of patient-reported shortness of breath in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) presented by Jolley and Moxham (10) describes the effects of daily activities on increasing respiratory muscle load-capacity imbalance, neural respiratory drive, and neuromechanical dissociation, which are magni /uniFB01 ed in severe emphysema and hyperin /uniFB02 ation. Hyperin /uniFB02 ation is a key contributor to an individual ' s perception of breathlessness and to exercise limitation (11, 12), and is a predictor not only of risk of exacerbation (13) but of all-cause mortality (14, 15), prompting targeted strategies to reduce hyperin /uniFB02 ation.\nIn selected individuals, lung volume reduction surgery has been shown to improve lung function, exercise capacity, dyspnea, and quality of life, and to extend survival (16, 17). However, only a small number of patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are eligible for lung volume reduction surgery, periprocedural morbidity and mortality is relatively high, and only a few hundred\nprocedures are performed annually in the United States. Recent efforts have been focused on the development of less invasive approaches. Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction using the Zephyr Endobronchial Valve (Zephyr Valve; Pulmonx Corporation) has been shown in multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to reduce hyperin /uniFB02 ation and to improve lung function, exercise tolerance, dyspnea, and overall quality of life in individuals with heterogeneous (18 -21) or homogeneous (22) emphysema and little to no interlobar collateral ventilation.\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a multifaceted condition and assessment of air /uniFB02 ow limitation alone does not adequately re /uniFB02 ect the burden of the disease. FEV1 has been shown to correlate poorly with patient-reported outcomes (PROs), including dyspnea, activity, and health status (23, 24). Furthermore, there is a signi /uniFB01 cant disparity between subjects ' perception of disease severity and the degree of severity indicated by a unidimensional breathlessness scale (25), which may lead to undertreatment. Therefore, to quantify symptoms, the most ef /uniFB01 cient and objective way is to assess symptom severity, activity limitation, and psychosocial status using multidimensional patient-centric measures (26). In doing so, a better estimate of treatment effects may be gained.\nThe LIBERATE (Lung Function Improvement after Bronchoscopic Lung Volume Reduction with Pulmonx Endobronchial Valves used in Treatment of Emphysema) study is the largest multicenter prospective RCT of the Zephyr Valve in patients with severe heterogeneous emphysema, hyperin /uniFB02 ation, and little to no interlobar collateral ventilation assessed using the Chartis System (Pulmonx Corp.).\nMultiple patient-centric assessments were included in the study to allow an in-depth evaluation of the impact of reduced hyperin /uniFB02 ation on dyspnea and symptoms that are most meaningful to patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Published PROs have so far focused on the modi /uniFB01 ed Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnea Scale and the St. George ' s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) total score. The importance of PROs in a comprehensive evaluation of response to treatment is recognized and recommended in recent guideline updates (27).\nWepresent the PROs of multidimensional measures of 1 ) dyspnea, from the Transitional Dyspnea Index (TDI), focal score; the Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) Assessment Test (CAT; breathlessness on hill/stairs); Borg; and the EXAcerbations of Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool [EXACT] -PRO, dyspnea domain; 2 ) activity, from the TDI, magnitude of task/effort/functional impairment; CAT (limited activities); and the SGRQ, activity domain; and 3 ) psychosocial status, from the SGRQ, impacts domain, and CAT (con /uniFB01 dence and energy) at 12 months after their bronchoscopic lung volume reductions with Zephyr Valves beyond the mMRC Dyspnea Scale and the SGRQ, total score, that were previously reported in the LIBERATE trial (21).

The multicenter study conducted under a U.S. Food and Drug Administration -approved Investigational Device Exemption for the Zephyr Valve was approved by the respective institutional review boards or ethics committees at each site, and all participating subjects were provided written informed consent. The study protocol is summarized in the online supplement.\nMultiple discrete and validated self-administered questionnaires were completed at baseline and follow-up visits, and have not been previously reported ( see Table E1 in the online supplement for timing of each assessment). These included: for dyspnea, the TDI, focal score; Borg scale of perceived exertion; EXACT-PRO diary, dyspnea domain; and the CAT question regarding breathlessness on hill/stairs; for activity, the TDI, magnitude of task, magnitude of effort, and functional impairment; the CAT questions regarding limited activities; and the SGRQ, activity domain; and, for psychosocial status, the SGRQ, impacts domain, and the CAT questions regarding con /uniFB01 dence and energy. Neither the study participants nor the assessing physicians were blinded to the randomization. At follow-up assessments, study participants were not reminded of, and thus were not aware of, their baseline scores.\nStudy participants also maintained a daily diary in which they noted adherence with the pulmonary rehabilitation program, completed the EXACT-PRO questionnaire, and noted health status changes. The following question was administered as part of the daily diary: ' Mark the scale to show the intensity of the emphysema symptoms you had today (scale of 0 = none to 10 = intolerable). ' Although this question was not validated, it asks a global question of clinical interest using a visual analogue scale of 0 to 10 for rating the subject ' s perception of emphysema symptom intensity every day. Days that were better or worse were determined by a follow-up score that was above (worse) or below (better) the baseline score.",

Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute). Descriptive statistics include means, standard deviations, and 95% con /uniFB01 dence intervals. Change from baseline to 12 months and the percentage of subjects meeting a minimal clinically important difference (MCID; or ' responder ' ) per group were reported using an MCID of greater than Odds ratio (or) equal to 15% increase for FEV1 (29), greater than Odds ratio (or) equal to 25 m increase for 6-minute-walk distance (6MWD) (30), greater than or equal to a 4-point reduction for the SGRQ (31), greater than or equal to a 1-point increase for the TDI (32), and greater than or equal to a 1-point reduction for mMRC Dyspnea Scale (33) and Borg (34). Changes from baseline were reported for EXACT-PRO, dyspnea domain, and individual CAT (35) questions only.\nMissing data for the prospectively de /uniFB01 ned primary and secondary endpoints were imputed as baseline carried forward for deaths, by linear interpolation for intermittent missing values, by multiple imputation methods for truncated missing values. Cohen ' s effect size was calculated as the difference in means divided by pooled standard deviation (referred to as Cohen ' s D). Continuous variables were compared with the Wilcoxon rank sum (for nonparametric data) or an analysis of covariance with the respective baseline value as the covariate (for parametric data), and categorical variables were compared with the Fisher exact test.\nScatter plots and Pearson correlation coef /uniFB01 cients were performed to assess the relationships between hyperin /uniFB02 ation (residual volume [RV] and RV/TLC) and dyspnea (EXACT-PRO), lung function (FEV1), quality of life (the SGRQ, total score), and exercise capacity (6MWD). Statistical signi /uniFB01 cance was determined at the P , 0.05 level.

      "content": "This post hoc analysis of data from the LIBERATE multicenter RCT demonstrated statistically signi /uniFB01 cant and clinically meaningful improvements in multiple patient-reported measures of dyspnea, activity, and psychosocial status favoring the Zephyr Valve over SoC at 12 months. The /uniFB01 ndings of this study expand on the results of RCTs evaluating the Zephyr Valve that have previously demonstrated physiological bene /uniFB01 ts and improvements in several measures of health-related quality of life, principally using the mMRC Dyspnea Scale and the SGRQ (18 -22, 36). It is also consistent with a meta-analysis that\ndemonstrated a correlation between lung volume reduction and clinical bene /uniFB01 t (37). Of particular signi /uniFB01 cance is the /uniFB01 nding that the effect size based on Cohen ' s D is moderate to large for each of the parameter assessed.\nDyspnea is usually the most burdensome symptom in patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is frequently multifactorial in origin (38). Hyperin /uniFB02 ation is a key factor driving exertional dyspnea in an individual with advanced emphysema (11). Multiple PROs demonstrated statistically signi /uniFB01 cant improvements in the Zephyr Valve group compared with SoC at 12 months, notably the TDI, focal score, and the EXACT-PRO, dyspnea domain. The TDI demonstrates a high correlation between dyspnea and stage of disease severity (39), and measures aspects of daily living as they relate to the amount of breathlessness experienced (40). The EXACTPRO offers a validated daily diary -based symptom assessment that helps to better characterize exacerbations (41) and reduce the recall bias affecting 60% of events that go unreported (42). Use of these questionnaires complement the information obtained from lung function measurements, helping to provide a more consistent description of an individual ' s sensation of breathlessness in response to lung volume reduction treatment.\nMost patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are relatively inactive, spending signi /uniFB01 cantly less time standing and walking than persons without Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (43). Dyspnea is the principal symptom limiting exercise in patients with advanced Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), leading to activity avoidance (3, 43 -45). It is important to\nbreak this cycle because reduced physical activity is a predictor of future risk of exacerbation, hospitalization, and early mortality (46, 47). Multiple measures of activity levels in patients treated with Zephyr Valves showed statistically signi /uniFB01 cant improvements compared with SoC at 12 months, notably the TDI measures of effort, task, and functional impairment. These changes in activity levels can be very meaningful for patients. For example, a 3-point change in the TDI, focal score, implies a return to most work/leisure activities previously impacted, and 54.9% of patients treated with Zephyr Valve achieved this in LIBERATE.\nThe impact of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is not limited to the physical restrictions levied on the lifestyle of the patient. The experience of breathlessness ' derives from interactions among multiple physiological psychological, social, and environmental factors, and may induce secondary physiological and behavioural responses ' (2). Breathlessness is associated with panic, anxiety, and depression (48). The inability to engage in activities of daily living can be one of the most distressing symptoms for patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The opportunity to improve quality of life and permit resumption, even in part, of familiar activities is highly desirable (49). Our /uniFB01 ndings show that patients using the Zephyr Valve had improvements in psychosocial status, demonstrated by statistically signi /uniFB01 cant improvements for patients using the Zephyr Valve over SoC in the SGRQ, impacts domain, and in CAT questions on patient con /uniFB01 dence and energy.\nChange in EXACT-PRO\nDyspnea Domain\nPatients frequently report good and bad days with signi /uniFB01 cant /uniFB02 uctuations over time (50 -53). The quantitative improvement in all three aspects of breathlessness, activity levels, and psychosocial well-being measured at speci /uniFB01 ed time points is also re /uniFB02 ected in the daily diary assessment of patients, with those using the Zephyr Valve experiencing signi /uniFB01 cantly more days that were better and fewer days that were worse over 12 months.\nThe improvements in multidimensional PROs were correlated with reduction in hyperin /uniFB02 ation and elaborate on the clinical bene /uniFB01 ts observed in individuals undergoing this treatment (37). Utilization of varied multidimensional questionnaires and of a daily diary assessment tool, as demonstrated in this study, afford a more comprehensive evaluation of the impact of the Zephyr Valve that is personalized to the symptoms of the individual and supports a phenotype-based management strategy as advocated by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines (38). These data add to the growing evidence base for the Zephyr Valve accomplishing and maintaining improvements that are not limited to lung function and objective exercise assessment but, importantly, to disease-speci /uniFB01 c symptoms and health-related quality of life, which permits patients the ability to reengage in their activities of daily living.\nThe strengths of the study include the use of standardized, validated, disease-speci /uniFB01 c, treatment-responsive instruments such as the SGRQ, CAT, and the TDI that provide a complement and re /uniFB01 nement to previously published physiological data that is meaningful to the individual, and which is crucial to guide therapeutic management. Moreover, a daily diary assessment adds greater detail and context to what is a variable tapestry of symptoms from day to day. Furthermore, they provide an easy and cost-ef /uniFB01 cient way for acquiring data to characterize complex issues such as breathlessness and health-related quality of life in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) that cannot be achieved by any one physiological correlate (26). Lastly, the presence of a SoC group out to 12 months affords more accurate measurement of the impact of the Zephyr Valve on these multidimensional metrics. Limitations of the study include the use of these qualitative tools that can be subject to recall bias (54) and could be further confounded due to the lack of blinding. Neither the study participants nor the assessing physicians were blinded to the randomization, which could introduce bias\nfor self-reported outcomes. However, the strong correlation between reduction in hyperin /uniFB02 ation as assessed by a reduction in RV and RV/TLC ratio, both of which are objective measures, and the changes from baseline to 12 months for postbronchodilator FEV1; 6MWD; the SGRQ score; and the EXACT-PRO, dyspnea domain, suggest that the results are robust. It should also be noted that the number of patients who did not complete the 12-month assessments was greater in those randomized to Zephyr Valves than in the SoC group, which could have biased the results toward bene /uniFB01 t. Finally, a select group of patients with severe emphysema and hyperin /uniFB02 ation with little or no collateral ventilation was treated, and the results cannot be generalized to other grades of air /uniFB02 ow limitation.",

      "content": "Post hoc analysis of data from the LIBERATE study demonstrate that patients with severe emphysema and hyperin /uniFB02 ation who achieve lung volume reductions following treatment with Zephyr Valves experience moderate to large improvements in multidimensional scores for breathlessness, activity, and psychosocial parameters that may permit reengagement in activities of daily living out to at least 12 months. The interruption of the downward spiral of symptom-induced inactivity, muscle deconditioning, and ensuing weakness allows patients to experience improved activity, feeling of well-being, more con /uniFB01 dence, and a better quality of life. These results supplement the /uniFB01 ndings of published randomized controlled studies in patients with heterogeneous (18 -21) and those with homogeneous (22) emphysema, in whom accompanying improvements in lung function, exercise capacity, dyspnea, and overall quality of life have consistently been shown. n\nAuthor disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org.\nThe LIBERATE Study Group: Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, Philadelphia, PA: Gerard J.
