Greater accuracy and precision of treatment  allow  very  high  biologically effective radiation doses to the tumor while minimizing  toxicity  and  radiation  to  surrounding  tissues. 3   This  dose  escalation  is  optimally  delivered using computed tomography (CT) simulators and linear accelerators with respiratory motion management. The two basic approaches to motion management  during  SBRT  are  gated  and  nongated treatments. Gated SBRT treatments often depend on fiducial  marker  (FM) implantation in or near the tumor to localize the corresponding structure and deliver the radiation only when the tumor is in the correct position in the breathing cycle, or during  a  breath-hold.  Nongated  SBRT  treatments typically  minimize  motion  through  mechanical compression of the abdomen to restrict diaphragmatic excursion. Other linear accelerator systems that depend on fiducials for respiratory-gated treatments  typically  monitor  fiducials  before,  during, and after the radiation beam is turned on to ensure the target center is correctly positioned, maximize accuracy of high-dose radiation treatments to small targets, and afford tight dose conformity to targets that are particularly close to organs at risk. 4-6\nFMs are also useful for localizing small peripheral lung tumors to aid the surgeon during parenchymal-sparing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) either alone or with pleural dye marking. 7-10\nFMs can be delivered percutaneously with image guidance 11,12 or through a video bronchoscope. 8,13,14 One challenge with percutaneous delivery methods is risk of pneumothorax, 12  which could be magnified when percutaneous biopsy and FM placement are attempted during the same procedure. 15  Cardiac and endovascular embolization have also been rarely reported in the literature after percutaneous fiducial placements. 16,17 On  the other  hand,  traditional  bronchoscopic  methods can be suboptimal for peripheral lesions. 18 Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) is  a  common  method  for  guiding  FM  placement. 13,19-21   However,  most  prior  studies  have been single-center, retrospective analyses that do not allow an evaluation of diversity in practice patterns or safety in a large prospective cohort.\nNAVIGATE is the largest  prospective  study  of ENB yet conducted, evaluating ENB-guided lung lesion biopsy, FM placement, pleural dye marking, and lymph node biopsy in a diverse, multicenter setting. 22-24  We report the safety, accuracy, and practice patterns of ENB-guided FM placement in NAVIGATE.",

      "content": "To our knowledge, this is the largest study of FM placement by any method for SBRT or surgical localization and the only prospective, multicenter\nstudy  of  FM  placement  yet  conducted.  Most studies report placing markers by bronchoscopic or  percutaneous  image-guided  approaches  with sample sizes ranging from 6 to 112 (18-245 FMs placed). 12,13,19,20\nOur  cohort  demonstrated  that  ENB-guided  FM placement is associated with low complication rates overall (7.0%), with pneumothorax in 5.4% (3.1% grade ⩾ 2),  occurring  less  often  compared  with reports of percutaneous FM placement (5-67%). 12 Pneumothorax  rates  in  this  FM-placement  substudy were similar to those published for the entire United States cohort (including ENB-guided lung biopsy, FM placement, and dye marking) at 4.3% overall and 2.9% for grade ⩾ 2. 22  In the 39 patients who had FM placement without biopsy, there were\nData are presented as % ( n /total n ) or median (interquartile range, Q1-Q3)].\n* Other than for lymph node biopsy but including all biopsy, fiducial, and pleural dye marking procedures.\n$ A total of 563 fiducial markers were placed in 258 patients (average 2.2 ± 1.7 markers per patient). Individual patient numbers do not sum to totals because each patient may be included in more than one category. § VISICOIL™§ image markers, IBA Dosimetry, Louvain-La-Neuve, Belgium\nCT, computed tomography; Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), endobronchial ultrasound; ENB, electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy; Q, quartile.\nno pneumothoraces or significant bleeding events. Thus,  with  or  without  concurrent  biopsy,  ENBguided FM placement has low complication rates.\nThe scope of this multicenter investigation highlighted  several  interesting  practice  patterns  not previously available in single-center studies. First, ENB  is  a  versatile  tool  for  evaluating  thoracic malignancies, allowing for FM placement, tissue sampling,  and  pleural  dye  marking  in  the  same anesthetic event. Of the 258 patients undergoing ENB-guided  FM  placement,  82.6%  (213/258) also  had  lung  lesion  biopsy  and  4.7%  (12/258) also had dye marking (including six patients with\nall  three  procedures).  Complication  rates  were similar for patients that had FM placement alone versus FM placement with other concurrent procedures. The flexibility to conduct multiple tasks under one anesthetic agent has the potential to be more convenient for the patient and reduce time from biopsy to therapy compared with conducting multiple  procedures  at  different  times.  Further study of the impact of ENB in the evaluation of thoracic malignancies is needed.\nSecond, 99% of FMs were accurately placed under ENB guidance based on the operator's subjective assessment.  Accuracy  of  marker  placement  for\nSBRT has been described in some studies as the ability of various tracking systems to track at least three FMs a certain distance and angle apart in six dimensions [ X (pitch), Y (row), Z (yaw) directions and  rotation  around  the X/Y/Z axes]. 5,6   Target tracking errors may result in inaccurate dosing and damage  to  uninvolved  surrounding  tissue. 19,20,25 Unfortunately, details on interfiducial marker distance,  degree  of  angles  between  FMs,  tracking accuracy,  and  SBRT  system  type  were  not  captured in NAVIGATE. These questions require further study.\nFM position and stability are critical for optimal SBRT  with  linear  accelerator  systems  using  a gated technique. In the current study, the type of FM used and number placed per patient varied between  operators,  ranging  from  1-12  with  a mean of 2.2 (the patient with 12 FMs placed had 2 lung lesions). This practice pattern variation is very  interesting  given  that  most  markers  placed were  for  SBRT  therapy.  If  respiratory  gating  is utilized, the general recommendation is to place at least three FMs per lesion, although this is not universally accepted. 5,6   However,  some  NAVIGATE centers routinely placed only two markers. ENBguided FM placement may also be employed if FMs previously placed by percutaneous methods were  inadequate  in  number  or  location.  The range  observed  in  NAVIGATE  likely  reflects practice pattern variation between centers, as well\nas differences between private practice and academic centers (which may be more likely to treat two  or  more  tumors  with  SBRT  and  therefore place more FM per patient overall). Interestingly, this practice pattern variation has also been documented in survey studies of radiation oncologists across the United States. 26\nThe  SuperLock  nitinol  coil  FM  was  the  most common (80.6%) FM used, possibly due to the exclusive use of that FM at the highest enrolling center  of  the  cohort.  Concern  about  marker migration  or  better  tactile  ability  for  surgical localization  may  influence  choice  of  FM  type. There is sparse information comparing the performance of various types of FMs. In one study of 15  patients  using  SuperLock  nitinol  coil  FMs who received SBRT, 100% of patients had retention of FMs from implantation. The authors also observed minimal interfractional  fiducial  migration during the course of radiation treatment. 27  In another study, the VortX coil FM had a retention rate of 96.7% (from pretreatment radiation planning CT scan to the first day of therapy) compared  to  two-band  (72%)  and  the  gold-seed (69%) markers. 19  The VortX FM was the second most common marker utilized in the NAVIGATE study. Regardless of the type of FM used, 94% were  present  on  follow-up  imaging.  For  those patients  that  ultimately  received  radiation  therapy, data on whether the FMs were maintained\nData are presented as % ( n /total n ).\n* Other than expected observations associated with anesthesia (e.g. common or expected postprocedure pain, transient nausea, transient emesis, postprocedure constipation).\n$ Includes 207 patients with ENB-guided fiducial marker placement plus ENB-guided lung lesion biopsy, 6 patients with ENB-guided fiducial marker placement plus ENB-guided pleural dye marking, and 6 patients with all 3 procedures (ENBguided fiducial marker placement, ENB-guided lung lesion biopsy, and ENB-guided pleural dye marking). CTCAE, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events; ENB, electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy.\nthrough  radiation  treatment  and  whether  there was  significant  interfractional  FM  migration  is unavailable. Factors affecting physician choice of FM type needs further exploration.\nWhile most operators utilized general anesthesia (69%) for FM placement, a significant number also employed moderate sedation in concordance with published literature. 28-30  The effect of sedation method on ENB-guided FM placement has not been specifically addressed. One report demonstrated no significant difference in procedural complications  between  general  anesthesia  and moderate  sedation  with  ENB-guided  biopsies, including 23 patients who underwent ENB solely for FM placement. 30\nThe median duration of the procedure was 57  min overall and 31  min for the ENB procedure, similar to  the  overall  NAVIGATE  study  (52  min  and 25  min, respectively) 22  and ENB literature reports ranging  from  20  to  70  min. 31,32   Procedure  times were even shorter in those patients with only FM placement and no lung lesion biopsy. Additionally, ENB guidance was aided by cone-beam CT in 4% and rEBUS in 37%. rEBUS is commonly used to confirm appropriate positioning for biopsy or FM placement. 33,34  These complimentary technologies help  to  confirm  appropriate  positioning  for  FM placement or biopsy, 35   and  to  correct  any  divergence between the data obtained preoperatively by CT scan and data obtained during bronchoscopy.\nA total of 62 patients had FM placed prior to lung surgery (50 for localization only and 12 for both SBRT and localization). Data were not collected on whether the markers were useful during the surgery, or the type of surgical approach (i.e. wedge resection  followed  by  lobectomy).  Additionally, the type of FM preferred by the surgeons or reasoning behind the FM choice was not recorded. Interestingly, there are only two prior, retrospective,  single-center  reports  of  ENB-guided  FM placement in four patients to aid in wedge resection of peripheral pulmonary nodules. 7,9  Successful CT-guided  percutaneous  localization  with  FM, hook wire, and pleural dye is well established for small  peripheral  nodules. 36-39   However,  percutaneous placement has been associated with multiple complications,  including  pneumothorax,  hemorrhage, pleural reaction, and dislodgement, which can lead to localization failure. 40,41  Further studies will clarify the optimal method and indication for preoperative marker placement to localize deeper\nnodules for surgical resection. The growing interest  in  robotic  surgery  for  segmental  and  subsegmental  resection  of  ground  glass  opacities  and subsolid nodules will likely require  improved methods  of  localization,  such  as  dye  or  FM placement.",

      "title": "Limitations",
      "content": "NAVIGATE is an observational cohort study collecting  data  on  ENB  procedures  in  a  large  and diverse study population. This pragmatic design provides a broad picture of ENB usage patterns and outcomes in a generalizable, unrestricted setting. However, it also poses some limitations with regard  to  important  data  not  mandated  by  the intentionally flexible study protocol. First, defining placement accuracy based on the operator's subjective assessment may not be the most clinically  appropriate  indicator  for  SBRT  success. Distance from the marker to the lesion, position of  markers,  and  migration  were  not  recorded. The ability to successfully track FM in three or more  dimensions  for  those  patients  receiving gated radiation treatments may have been a more relevant  definition.  Second,  the  type  of  SBRT system used per operator was not specified. Given the heterogeneity of radiation systems employed to  treat  patients  with  lung  SBRT,  it  is  unclear whether the FMs were used to deliver gated treatments  or  whether  they  were  simply  used  to improve  target  localization  for  nongated  treatments. Third, only the number of FMs placed per patient, not per lesion, was recorded. The number of fiducials used was left to the discretion of the  bronchoscopist,  presumably  based  on  feedback from the radiation oncologist or local physicist.  This  reflects  widely  variable  SBRT  clinical practice patterns. 26  Finally, lesion characteristics data (such as location and size) were not collected for the FM subgroup.",
