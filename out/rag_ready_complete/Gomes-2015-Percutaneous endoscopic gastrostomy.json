Meta-analysis indicated that the primary outcome of intervention failure, occurred in lower proportion of participants with PEG compared to NGT (Relative risk (RR)\n0.18, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.59, eight studies, 408 participants, low quality evidence )  and this difference was statistically significant. For this outcome, we also subgrouped the studies by endoscopic gastrostomy technique into pull, and push and not reported .  We observed a significant difference favouring PEG in the pull subgroup (Relative risk (RR) 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.35, three studies, 90 participants). The push subgroup contained only one clinical trial and the result favoured PEG (Relative risk (RR) 0.05, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.74, one study, 33 participants) techniques. We found no statistically significant difference in cases where the technique was not reported (Relative risk (RR) 0.43, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.44, four studies, 285 participants).\nThere was no statistically significant difference between the groups for meta-analyses of the secondary outcomes of mortality (Relative risk (RR) 0.86, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.28, 644 participants, nine studies, very low quality evidence ), overall reports of any adverse event at any follow-up time point (ITT analysis, Relative risk (RR) 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.34), 597 participants, 6 studies, moderate quality evidence ), specific adverse events including pneumonia (aspiration) (Relative risk (RR) 0.70, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.06, 645 participants, seven studies, low quality evidence ), Odds ratio (or) for the meta- analyses of the secondary outcome of nutritional status including weight change from baseline, and mid-arm circumference at endpoint, although there was evidence in favour of PEG for meta-analyses of mid-arm circumference change from baseline (MD 1.16, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.31, 115 participants, two studies), and levels of serum albumin were higher in the PEG group (MD 6.03, 95% CI 2.31 to 9.74, 107 participants).\nFor meta-analyses of the secondary outcomes of time on enteral nutrition, there was no statistically significant difference (MD 14.48, 95% CI -2.74 to 31.71; 119 participants, two studies). For meta-analyses of quality of life measures (EuroQol) outcomes in two studies with 133 participants, for inconvenience (Relative risk (RR) 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.29), discomfort (Relative risk (RR) 0.03, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.29), altered body image (Relative risk (RR) 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.18; P = 0.001) and social activities (Relative risk (RR) 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.18) the intervention favoured PEG, that is, fewer participants found the intervention of PEG to be inconvenient, uncomfortable or interfered with social activities. However, there were no significant differences between the groups for pain, ease of learning to use, or the secondary outcome of length of hospital stay (two studies, 381 participants).",

      "content": "A  number  of  conditions  compromise  the  passage  of  food  along the  digestive  tract.  Disturbances  may  be  due  to  blockage,  as seen  in  stenosis  and  cancer  of  the  stomach  or  larynx,  or  due  to swallowing difficulties such as in genetic diseases, stroke sequelae, cranial encephalic trauma, brain tumours, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  (Heemskerk  2014;  Löser  2005;  Piecuch  2013;  Schneider 2014).  Several  approaches  are  available  to  provide  nutritional support (Nugent 2013). Nasogastric tube (NGT) feeding is a classic, time-proven  technique,  although  its  prolonged  use  can  lead  to adverse events such as lesions to the nasal wing, chronic sinusitis, gastro-oesophageal  reflux,  and  aspiration  pneumonia  (Bastow 1986; Beavan 2010). Two meta-analyses comparing tube placement into the stomach or duodenum revealed no significant difference between the methods in terms of length of hospital stay, mortality, or  adverse  events  (Ho  2006;  Marik  2003).  In  addition  to  adverse events, the need to change the tube due to blockage inherent to its narrow gauge coupled with its disagreeable appearance in social settings have led to the election of alternative techniques whenever possible (Zaherah 2012).\nGastrostomy  has  been  used  to  gain  access  to  the  stomach  for long-term enteral feeding in patients with swallowing limitations who require nutritional support. The main criteria for  indicating gastrostomy are (i) a reasonable prospect of patient survival and (ii)  normal  intestinal  function  (Friginal-Ruiz  2011).  This  surgical procedure was first carried out successfully in humans in 1876, by Verneuil in France. Following various modifications, Stamm devised the technique most frequently used to this day (Ljungdahl 2006). In 1980, Gauderer et al described a new technique of feeding tube placement in gastrostomy using endoscopy, called percutaneous endoscopic  gastrostomy  (PEG).  This  involves  a  local  anaesthetic and  does  not  require  laparotomy  (Gauderer  1980).  Since  the introduction of PEG, a number of studies comparing methods of gastrostomy have been conducted, such as operative, push and pull PEG techniques (Köhler 2014; Stiegmann 1990; Tucker 2003).\nPrevious systematic reviews and meta-analyses on enteral nutrition approaches have been performed, but not with the broad scope  we  propose.  Langmore  2006  published  a  meta-analysis that  investigated  enteral  nutrition,  specifically  in  amyotrophic lateral  sclerosis,  comparing  the  use  of  several  types  of  feeding tubes  in  patients  being  fed  orally.  However,  they  did  not  find any  controlled  or  randomised  studies.  Another  meta-analysis compared nutrition by endoscopic gastrostomy and NGT including only  post-stroke  patients  (Bath  1999).  Thereafter,  a  number  of controlled and randomised studies were published that compared the  two  methods  of  nutritional  support  in  stroke  patients  and those  admitted  to  intensive  care  units  with  a  range  of  different pathologies,  as  well  as  individuals  on  mechanical  ventilation (Dennis 2005; Douzinas 2006; Hamidon 2006; McClave 2005).\nAssessment  of  these  latest  studies  in  patients  with  a  range  of pathologies,  together  with  analysis  of  the  optimal  moment  to commence nutritional support,  warrant  mapping  by  means  of  a systematic  review  so  as  to  offer  the  best  evidence  available  on which to base decisions.",

      "title": "Description of the condition",
      "content": "Malnutrition  encompasses overnutrition  and  undernutrition,  but undernutrition  is  a  prevalent,  and  undesired  condition  affecting\nup to  40%  of  hospitalised  patients  (Barker  2011).  This  condition has  important  causal  associations  with  morbidity  and  mortality, by  affecting,  for  example,  length  of  stay  in  hospital;  recovery from  illness,  surgery  and  injury;  cardiac  function,  weak  muscles (including  respiratory  muscles),  with  consequent  higher  risk  of thromboembolism, chest infection, and pressure sores (Geeganage 2012; Iwamoto 2014; Löser 2010; Pearce 2002; Valente  da Silva  2012).  Mortality  rates  tend  to  be  higher  in  elderly  and undernourished  patients  in  comparison  to  other  subgroups  of hospitalised patients (Ordoñez 2013; Valente da Silva 2012). In this sense, swallowing disturbances are of special interest, because of its direct relationship with undernutrition (Poisson 2014).\nThe  clinical  diagnosis  of  swallowing  disturbances  can  be  given based on clinical signals such as delay in swallowing, pharyngeal sensibility, abnormality or absence of tongue movements; loosening of water from lips, pocketing of food in the cheek, under the tongue or on the hard palate, coughing or choking while eating or signs of penetration or aspiration (Falsetti 2009; Simons 2014). Although not usually used in daily practice, radiological tests like videofluoroscopic modified barium swallow and videofluoroscopic swallowing study can be used for diagnosis of dysphagia (Finestone 2003; Scheeren 2014; Stec 2008).\nPatients with indications for enteral nutrition (nutrients intake by means of feeding tubes) include those with conditions associated with  swallowing  disorders,  such  as  motor  neuron  disease  and multiple  sclerosis;  physical  obstruction  to  swallowing,  such  as oesophageal  tumours;  an  inability  to  ingest  food  due  to  head injury  or  stroke;  and  those  with  anorexia  due  to  an  underlying disease  such  as  chronic  lung  disease,  irritable  bowel  disease,  or cancer  (Botella  Romero  2012;  de  Aguilar-Nascimento  2011;  Fini 2014;  Kolaček  2013;  Manba  2014).  Dysphagic  patients  and  those with  anorexia,  malabsorption,  or  excessive  catabolism  also  may need  long-term  enteral  feeding  (Le  2010;  Gentile  2012;  Pearce 2002). Aspiration risk often is an indication for nutritional support using tubes (Corry 2008; Metheny 2010). Enteral nutrition can be provided in the form of drink supplements or, if a patient is unable to take adequate nutritional supplements orally, fed via an enteral tube into  the  stomach  or  small  bowel  (Granell  Vidal  2014;  Löser 2005).",

      "content": "In  general,  tube  systems  for  artificial  enteral  nutrition  can  be positioned  by  nasal  insertion,  guided  percutaneous  application, or  surgical  techniques  (Abdel-Lah  Mohamed  2006;  Blumenstein 2014; Gopalan 2003; Schröder 2004). The superiority of percutaneously  placed  gastrostomies  compared  with  the  former surgical gastrostomy procedures (that is, Witzel, Stamm, Janeway techniques)  has  been  clearly  suggested  (Löser  2005;  Ljungdahl 2006).  Lower complication rates, reduced hospital length of stay and costs have been reported (Grant 1988; Ljungdahl 2006). Most patients  who  require  nutritional  support  need  it  for  around  one month or less, with the nasogastric sound probe being the main way of infusion (Blumenstein 2014; Pearce 2002). The probe used is  made  of  thin  polyurethane,  size  14  with  an  internal  diameter of  3.3  mm,  and  is  inserted  by  a  trained  professional  in  order  to prevent adverse events such as perforation and tracheobronchial location (Hamidon 2006; Löser 2005). Another method of infusion, percutaneous  endoscopy  gastrostomy  (PEG),  is  generally  used when there is a need for enteral nutrition for a longer time period (Löser 2005; Pearce 2002). This procedure can be done by either\n'pull'  or  'push'  techniques,  the  former  being  simpler  and  more frequently used. Both techniques use a silicon probe (for example 24 Fr, internal diameter 5.5 mm). The puncture site is marked with gastroscopic monitoring of the anterior gastric wall in the region of the distal corpus, after adequate local anaesthesia and intravenous sedation  (Hamidon  2006;  Löser  2005).  Prospective  studies  have shown that the early insertion of the probe via PEG improves the patient's nutritional state (Hamidon 2006; Norton 1996). Patients treated for head and neck carcinoma have considered PEG to be more  acceptable  than  a  NGT,  even  though  persistent  dysphagia was associated with PEG (Mekhail 2001). A cohort study verified the acceptability of PEG, with significantly higher survival time and lower aspiration rates (Dwolatzky 2001) compared to NGT. On the other  hand,  a  narrative  review  (Plonk  2005)  reported  increased risk of death in stroke patients with PEG compared with NGT and concluded that aspiration pneumonia rates were similar. Published guidelines  on  enteral  nutrition  recommend  the  performing  of gastrostomy, preferably endoscopically (Löser 2005).\nRadiologically  placed  gastrostomy  (RIG)  is  another  method  of enteral nutrition, but operationally different from PEG. RIG is not an endoscopic procedure and utilises fluoroscopy, performed in an interventional radiologic suite (Barkmeier 1998; Chiò 2004).",

      "content": "The percutaneous gastronomy probe is of a larger calibre compared with  an  NGT  and  is  placed  in  the  abdomen.  This  leads  to  less interruption  of  nutrition  caused  by  the  probe  being  withdrawn as well as reduced reflux with consequent aspiration, thus being less embarrassing for the patient (Dwolatzky 2001; Pearce 2002). Patients and  carers believe that nutrition via  PEG  helps  in feeding and the ability to cope, being more convenient than NGT (Anis  2006).  PEG-related  morbidity  and  mortality  are  9.4%  and 0.53%, respectively (Wollman 1995). There are, however, exclusive adverse events for endoscopy percutaneous gastrostomy, such as peritonitis, buried bumper syndrome, gastrocolocutaneous fistula, and  wound  infection  (Potack  2008).  Adverse  events  associated with NGT due to its nasogastric insertion and positioning are also cited, including sinusitis, laryngeal ulcerations, pneumothorax, and tracheoesophagic fistula; the latter due to incorrect positioning of the tube (Pearce 2002).",

This  makes  PEG  the  procedure of  choice  for  nutritional  support  in  adults.  The  same  author commented that many such procedures are performed, although there is no consistent evidence about what is the more effective and safe method. Because NGT and PEG are the most commonly used methods for feeding access (Pearce 2002), a systematic review is worth performing to resolve such questions.",

The  mean  age  of  these patients was 72 years (range: 62 to 82 years). Park 1992 included only patients with dysphagia secondary to neurologic diseases in their sample. The mean age of these patients in the NGT group was 65 years, whereas the mean age of those in the PEG group was 56 years. Norton 1996 and Bath 1997 included in their sample patients with  dysphagia  after  acute  stroke  with  a  mean  age  of  77  years. Yata 2001 studied patients with dysphagia in several diseases, such as  dementia,  Parkinson's  disease,  and  cerebrovascular  disease. These  patients  had  a  mean  age  of  75.1  years  (range:  50  to  96 years)  in  the  PEG  group  and  76.5  years  (range:  38  to  93  years) in  the  NGT group. Dennis 2005 included in their sample patients who presented with dysphagia after acute stroke. Their mean age was  76  years  (SD  =  10  years).  Douzinas  2006  assessed  patients with different diseases, some of whom presented with recurrent or persistent ventilator-associated pneumonia. These patients had a median age of 53 years (range: 20 to 82 years) in the PEG group and 58 years (range: 25 to 85 years) in the NGT group. Hamidon 2006 investigated patients with dysphagia after acute stroke with a median age of 65 years (range: 48 to 79 years) in the PEG group and 72 years (range: 54 to 77 years) in the NGT group. Finally, Corry 2008  included  in  their  sample  patients  with  cancer  of  the  head and neck with a median age of 60 years (range: 46 to 80 years). In Sadasivan 2012, participants had advanced stage two or three squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and were scheduled either for radical surgery with adjuvant radiotherapy (RT), chemoRT, or for concurrent chemo and radiation therapy were included in the study. The age of participants in the study was not reported and we were unable to obtain further data.

Elbadawy 2014 and Sadasivan 2012  followed  up  participants  at  one  week,  six  weeks  and  six months.\nThe included studies reported our review outcomes as follows:\nOur primary outcome, intervention failure, was reported in eight studies  (Baeten  1992;  Bath  1997;  Corry  2008;  Hamidon  2006; Norton 1996; Park 1992; Sadasivan 2012; Yata 2001). Elbadawy 2014 reported the number of adverse events in each group; we requested further information, but the study investigators were not able to provide the number of patients with the primary review outcome of intervention failures (e.g., feeding interruption, blocking or leakage of the tube, no adherence to treatment). Participant non-adherence to treatment was reported in Sadasivan 2012,\nMortality  was  reported  in  nine  studies  (Baeten  1992;  Bath  1997; Corry 2008; Dennis 2005; Douzinas 2006; Elbadawy 2014; Hamidon 2006; Norton 1996; Park 1992).\nAdverse effects were reported in seven studies (Baeten 1992; Corry 2008; Dennis 2005; Douzinas 2006; Elbadawy 2014; Norton 1996; Sadasivan 2012). Pneumonia, the result of aspirating food into the airway,  was  reported  in  seven  studies  (Baeten  1992;  Corry  2008; Dennis  2005;  Douzinas  2006;  Elbadawy  2014;  Norton  1996;  Yata 2001). Reflux oesophagitis was reported in Yata 2001.\nTwo studies additionally reported measures related to the nutritional  status  of  the  participants:  weight  gain  (Norton  1996; Sadasivan 2012), mid-arm circumference (Norton 1996; Sadasivan 2012), serum albumin levels (Norton 1996), and haemoglobin levels (Sadasivan 2012).\nThe  length  of  hospital  stay  was  reported  in  two  studies  (Dennis 2005; Elbadawy 2014); and the time of entry nutrition in days was reported in Baeten 1992 and Park 1992.\nOther outcome measures included quality-of-life measures using the  EORTC QLQ-H&N35 scale in Corry 2008 and Sadasivan 2012. Scores  of  patient  satisfaction  and  inconvenience  of  maintaining PEG  or  NGT  by  nursing  staff  were  reported  in  Baeten  1992;  it  is unclear if these were validated scales.

On the contrary, the studies by Bath 1997; Corry 2008; Douzinas 2006; Hamidon 2006; Sadasivan 2012; Yata 2001 were considered to be unclear for risk of bias. Although the authors described random allocation,  they  did  not  report  the  methods  used  for  allocation concealment.  No  attempt  was  made  to  conceal  allocation  in Elbadawy 2014.\nOverall, no unusually large differences were noted in the demographic  characteristics  of  patients  from  each  group  on study  entry,  except  in  Sadasivan  2012,  where  there  were  more participants in the PEG group who had radical surgery and adjuvant radio or chemotherapy, and more participants in the NGT group had concurrent chemo or radio therapy. Participants in the NGT group weighed more at the start of the trial.",

There was statistical heterogeneity present in the analysis of pain (I$^{2} = 95%) and ease of learning to use (I$^{2} = 94%), and low levels of statistical heterogeneity in the analyses of inconvenience and discomfort (I$^{2} = 21%).\nThe  outcome  of  family  life  could  not  be  entered  into  a  metaanalysis as Corry 2008 did not report this subscale. Using data from Sadasivan 2012 only, this outcome favoured the PEG group and this was a statistically  significantly  different  (Relative risk (RR)  0.01,  95%  CI  0.00  to 0.18; n=100, P = 0.001).\nDennis  2005  reported  the  mean  difference  between  comparison groups at endpoint derived from the EuroQol (reported as 0.035 95% CI -0.024 to 0.093). We could not include these data in our metaanalyses, but the report of the study states that the results were not statistically significantly different.",

      "content": "This  systematic  review  of  11  included  studies  comprising  735 randomised  participants  in  total  (373  receiving  percutaneous endoscopic  gastrostomy  (PEG)  and  362  nasogastric  tube  (NGT)), produced 16 meta-analyses in total,  for  the  primary  outcome  of intervention failure (subgrouped by gastrostomy technique and by baseline  disease)  and  for  the  secondary  outcomes  of  mortality, adverse effects in total and also pneumonia as a result of aspiration, nutritional  status  including  weight  change  from  baseline,  midarm circumference at endpoint and change from baseline, time of enteral nutrition in days, length of stay in days, and quality of life measured by the EuroQol scale.\nIn our meta-analyses, overall, the estimated effects for the primary outcome of intervention failure showed a statistically  significant lower risk in the PEG group compared with the NGT group, and this was confirmed in subgroup analyses of intervention failure for both the  'push'  and  'pull'  gastrostomy  techniques  (subgroup  analysis of those studies which did not report the gastrostomy technique showed no statistically significant difference between PEG or NGT). However, we cannot infer from the effect sizes that one technique (push  or  pull)  is  superior  to  the  other  as  we  did  not  carry  out comparisons (indirect analysis) of the different techniques using data from separate studies.\nWe carried out additional intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses for the outcome of intervention failure specifically for the four studies with participants  with  mixed  baseline  diseases,  and  for  intervention failure  in  the  four  studies  where  the  gastrostomy  technique  was not reported, and we found no statistically significant differences between the PEG and NGT groups.\nNo direct causal relationship with the procedures was established for the secondary outcome of mortality i.e. there was no statistically significant difference between PEG or NGT for this outcomes. Only Dennis  2005  and  Baeten  1992  reported  a  relationship  between procedure-related mortality and global mortality, ranging from 0% to 10%. These low rates support the notion that the use of these methods may have no significant influence on risk of death.\nMeta-anaysis  of  adverse  effects  irrespective  of  follow-up  time showed no statistically significant differences between the groups, and  an  ITT  analysis  of  five  studies  for  this  outcome  showed no statistically significant differences  between  the  PEG  and NGT  groups.  Fewer  participants  in  the  PEG  group  experienced pneumonia, an adverse event precipitated by aspiration of stomach contents  or  oro-pharyngeal  secretions  into  the  airway,  but  this difference was not statistically significant.\nThe meta-analyses of the secondary outcome of nutritional status i.e. weight change from baseline showed no statistically significant difference between the groups; endpoint mid-arm circumference was  not  statistically  significantly  different  between  the  groups, although  the  outcome  of  mid-arm  circumference  in  centimetres (change from baseline) was statistically significant in favour of PEG.\nThe meta-analysis of quality-of-life measures (a secondary outcome) was statistically significant favouring PEG (that is, more patients  in  the  NGT  group  reported  worse  outcomes)  for  the outcomes of inconvenience, discomfort, altered or bad body image, social  activities  and  in  a  single  study  analysis,  interference  with family life.\nWe also present analyses of data from single studies for the primary outcome of intervention failure that is non-adherence to treatment, and the secondary outcomes of adverse effects (specifically reflux oesophagitis),  nutritional  status  including  weight  at  endpoint, serum  albumin  levels  and  change  from  baseline,  changes  in haemoglobin levels g/dL from baseline, and measures of quality of life including scores of patient satisfaction and of inconvenience in  maintaining  the  PEG  or  NGT  by  nurses,  participant  functional ability,  and  impact  on  family  life  measured  by  the  EORTCQLQH&N35  (in  one  study).The  single  study  analyses  of  the  primary outcome non-adherence to treatment was statistically significant in favour of the PEG group at the six-week and six-month followup  point  in  Sadasivan  2012  and  notably  all  the  dropouts  from treatment were from the NGT group in that study (at six months there were no patients in the NGT group due to resumption of oral feeds (n = 10) or conversion to a PEG tube (n = 34).\nFor  the  secondary  outcome  of  adverse  effects,  fewer  patients in  the  Yata  2001  study  reported  reflux  oesophagitis  in  the  PEG group and this was statistically significant favouring PEG. For the secondary  outcome  of  nutritional  status,  the  mean  participant body weight in kilograms at the endpoint, showed no statistically significant difference favouring PEG or NGT. Serum albumin levels at endpoint were statistically significant in Norton 1996, favouring the PEG group and also the serum albumin change from baseline were  statistically  significant  favouring  PEG  in  Sadasivan  2012. Haemoglobin levels expressed as a change from baseline also were higher in the PEG group and this was a statistically significant in the only study that reported this outcome (Sadasivan 2012).\nOutcomes relating to quality of life, including the scores of patient satisfaction and inconvenience in maintaining the intervention by nurses as reported in Baeten 1992, were not statistically significant in favour of either PEG or NGT. Functional ability reported in Dennis 2005 favoured neither PEG nor NGT.\nAnalyses of time on enteral nutrition and length of hospital stay favoured neither PEG nor NGT. However, these analyses of time are very  unlikely  to  follow  a  normal  distribution,  so  the  analyses  of mean differences are not necessarily accurate.These results should\nbe interpreted cautiously as the assumption of normality for these outcomes may not be met.\nThese  conclusions  were  not  changed  by  the  2014  update  of  the review.",

      "content": "Based on the findings of this review, outcomes in participants who received nutritional support via a PEG may be more favourable that in those who have a NGT, especially for the outcome of intervention failure,  based  on  an  examination  of  408  participants  who  had heterogeneous clinical and demographic characteristics.\nParticipants  receiving  PEG  may  be  more  likely  to  adhere  to treatment  at  six  weeks  and  six  months.  However,  we  found  no evidence of a difference in mortality or adverse events (aspiration pneumonia) between the comparison groups. This non significant result  does  not  imply  no  difference  and  we  suggest  that  the review  may  not  have  had  sufficient  power  to  look  at  these  less common events. Participants receiving PEG may experience less reflux oesophagitis (an adverse event). There is limited evidence, derived from single study results and small meta-analyses that PEG results in better outcomes in terms participants' nutritional status (mid-arm circumference, haemoglobin levels and serum albumin), and report better quality of life.\nWe  found  clinical  heterogeneity  between  the  studies  and  noted statistical  heterogeneity  in  some  of  our  analyses.  For  example, for  our  analyses  of  intervention  failure,  our  primary  outcome, we  observed  high  levels  of  statistical  heterogeneity  resulting from  the  inclusion  of  the  Baeten  1992  and  Yata  2001  trials.  One explanation  for  this  may  be  the  clinical  heterogeneity  between the trials, with the participants having different baseline diseases. We made a post-hoc decision to investigate the possible reasons for  heterogeneity  in  the  intervention  failure  meta-analysis  as  we assumed that the source of this statistical heterogeneity would be related  to  clinical  heterogeneity.  We  hypothesised  that  baseline disease  may  have  contributed  to  clinical  heterogeneity  and  we categorised  the  studies  by  baseline  disease,  i.e.  cerebrovascular event or neurological disorder versus mixed baseline disease (i.e. participants  who  may  have  had  severe  co-morbidities  including cancer)  and  found  that  for  the  outcome  of  intervention  failures in participants with cerebrovascular or neurological disease only, the results favoured PEG (i.e. fewer participants in the PEG group experienced any of the adverse events evaluated in the studies), but there was no difference between the groups for the mixed baseline disease  subgroups  and  these  studies  included  Baeten  1992  and Yata 2001. However, our hypothesis and the results of this analysis only point to one possible cause of heterogeneity, and this should be adequately tested in future studies. One further source of clinical heterogeneity in the remaining analyses could be because of the different techniques used to insert the PEG.\nMany  of  the  studies  reported  continuous  outcome  data  in  a format  that  could  not  be  incorporated  in  to  our  meta-analyses for example, median values. This limited the number of analyses that we could perform and we reported these data narratively in the review. Information reported in this way should be regarded as  providing  additional  information  only  and  the  analyses  we performed including meta-analysis, forest plots, tests for statistical heterogeneity provide more precise estimates of effects.",

      "content": "The  findings  of  the  present  review  of  the  literature  should  be interpreted with caution, given that almost half of the authors failed to report the method used to sequence and conceal the allocation (Figure  2;  Figure  3).  This  is  one  of  the  main  causes  of  error  in randomised systematic studies. In addition, other potential risks of bias stemmed from the absence of prior planning of follow-up time,  as  well  as  the  unpublished  or  high  rates  of  losses  during follow-up. However, almost all of the authors attempted to prevent attrition by making the flow of patients clear and through selective reporting  bias  by  selecting  clinically  relevant  outcomes.  There are  also  challenges  relating  to  the  study  design  in  terms  of  the numbers available for randomisation, following up such seriously ill patients and the high cost of the procedures in question. These factors  may  explain  why  the  majority  of  studies  involve  small samples.  It  should  be  noted  that  all  of  the  studies  were  judged at  high  risk  of  performance  bias  because  it  is  not  possible  to blind  participants  and  personnel  in  studies  of  this  nature.  In  all cases  of  uncertainly  we  attempted  to  obtain  further  information or  disaggregated  data  from  the  trial  investigator,  but  where  this was not available it  was  because  the  investigator  no  longer  had access to historical trial data, or was unable to provide additional information.  This  systematic  review  of  the  literature  is  valuable in analysing 11 studies, thereby increasing the sample size to 735 participants. Nevertheless, further randomised clinical trials that adopt a rigorous method are warranted.\nWe rated the overall quality of the evidence as moderate or low for the key outcomes of treatment failure, mortality, pneumonia and adverse  events  (Summary  of  findings  for  the  main  comparison), resulting  in  lower  confidence  in  the  estimate  of  effect  for  those outcomes  and  further  research  is  likely  to  have  an  important impact  in  our  confidence  in  the  estimate  of  effect  and  may even change the estimate. Where we downgraded the evidence, it was  because  there  was  risk of bias in the trial, out of eight  estimates  of  potential  bias  (random  sequence  generation; allocation concealment; incomplete outcome data; selective reporting;  blinding  of  participants  and  personnel;  blinding  of outcome  assessment,  and  other  bias)  only  six  studies  obtained scores of four or more. The included studies involved relatively few participants and wide confidence intervals (imprecision), although it  is  accepted  that  large  scale  studies  of  this  type  would  be  very difficult to perform. The results of many meta-analyses had high levels of statistical heterogeneity (inconsistency).",

      "content": "In  one  of  the  major  controlled  randomised  trials  performed  to date  (Dennis  2005),  the  authors  suggested  that  NGT  should  be the  method  of  choice  in  the  first  two  to  three  weeks  of  enteral feeding, probably in light of the increased absolute risk of death associated with the use of PEG (Relative risk (RR) 1.02, P = 0.86) and the absolute risk of the outcome composed by MRS scale (modified Rankin scale) from four to five or death (Relative risk (RR) 1.10, P = 0.05). However, combining the  results  of  11  different  studies  with ≅ 400  patients,  it  seems that the PEG option is associated with a lower risk of intervention failure. Given the importance of this finding, selecting PEG might reduce  the  difference  in  cost  between  the  two  procedures.  The findings of all of the other studies included in this analysis seem to support the use of PEG. Guidelines suggest that PEG is a highly effective  and  safe  procedure  when  modern  equipment  is  used, established standards are followed (Löser 2005). However, a careful patient  selection  and  professional  proficiency  are  fundamental for better outcomes (Blumenstein 2014; Skitt 2011). In a narrative review, Plonk 2005 suggested that the use of PEG should only be considered in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, intestinal blockage by malignant tumour with incoercible vomiting, persistent dysphagia after acute stroke, and early head and neck cancer. However, the results of a systematic review that included studies with different designs suggests that PEG and NGT have the same effectiveness and safety for patients with head and neck cancer, even considering relevant outcomes, such as mortality and nutritional status (Wang 2014). Although no study included in our systematic review made available  information  about  the  use  of  nasal  looping  technique, there is some evidence that such NGT technique has potential to be preferable over PEG (Anderson 2004).",

      "content": "Based on the findings of this meta-analysis, the results favoured PEG rather than NGT for intervention failure, but not for mortality and  pneumonia  rates,  and  other  adverse  events.  There  may  be some advantage in terms of nutritional status in using PEG over NGT, and patients may report better quality of life when using a PEG tube.\nIn  routine  practice,  however,  the  costs  and  benefits  of  both procedures  should  be  taken  into  account.  Some  health  service providers, particularly under  the public health system, face difficulties  acquiring  endoscopic  gastrostomy  apparatus  due  to their high cost. Possible reasons for the current state of the research in  this  area  include  the  high  cost  of  the  procedures  in  question. Corry 2008 provided an example of this stating that the \"cost of each feeding tube is $26 for a NGT and $110 for a PEG tube\" However, it is noteworthy that because nasogastric tubes are easier to introduce\n(more  often  by  the  nursing  team)  and  less  weight  is  placed  on the cost of constantly changing them as stated in Corry 2008 \"The insertion costs are significantly different as the NGT are inserted by nursing staff in outpatients and the PEG tubes are inserted by surgeons in theatre. The cost for insertion of a NGT is $50 (includes nursing time and cost of chest X-ray), whereas the cost of insertion of a PEG tube is $626\". Therefore endoscopic gastrostomies may be less frequently indicated (Corry 2008).\nIt  is  important  to  note  that  in  clinical  practice,  an  endoscopic examination  performed  prior  to  PEG  insertion  is  indicated  in all cases,  as  the  patient  might  present  with  lesions  of  the gastrointestinal tract, which prevents the passage of the endoscopy device and even tubes. In such patients, gastric tumours might also be present, which precludes gastrostomy. Partial gastric resections can also influence patients to elect to use alternative methods of enteral feeding.",

Future  studies  should provide adequate baseline information such as baseline disease, gender  and  age  of  the  participants.
