Mehta, MD, FCCP\nTracheobronchial injury is a rare but a potentially high-impact event with signi /uniFB01 cant morbidity and mortality. Common etiologies include blunt or penetrating trauma and iatrogenic injury that might occur during surgery, endotracheal intubation, or bronchoscopy. Early recognition of clinical signs and symptoms can help risk-stratify patients and guide management. In recent years, there has been a paradigm shift in the management of tracheal injury towards minimally invasive modalities, such as endobronchial stent placement. Although there are still some de /uniFB01 nitive indications for surgery, selected patients who meet traditional surgical criteria as well as those patients who were deemed to be poor surgical candidates can now be managed successfully using minimally invasive techniques. This paradigm shift from surgical to nonsurgical management is promising and should be considered prior to making /uniFB01 nal management decisions. CHEST 2019; 155(3):595-604\nTracheobronchial injury is a potentially lifethreatening clinical scenario. Blunt or penetrating trauma and iatrogenic injury are the most common causes of tracheobronchial injuries 1 (Table 1). Penetrating airway injury can occur from sharp objects, such as knives and ice picks, or from gunshot wounds. 2-5 Iatrogenic airway injury can occur during surgery, endotracheal (ET) intubations, or bronchoscopy. 6-10\nThe incidence of airway injury is likely to be underestimated as these injuries are often underrecognized and underreported. The incidence of airway injury is estimated to be 0.005% for all ET intubations. 1 This incidence\nincreases in patients intubated with a doublelumen tube and has been reported to be between 0.05% and 0.19%. 6,11,12 During percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) tracheobronchial injury occurs in approximately 1% of cases in the form of posterior tracheal wall perforation. 13 Other causes of tracheobronchial injury include intrathoracic, esophageal, and head and neck surgical interventions including mediastinoscopy. 14-16 Tracheo-esophageal /uniFB01 stula as an intermediate or late complication of open surgical tracheostomy may occur due to incidental intraprocedural damage to the posterior tracheal wall. 17 For esophageal surgeries requiring combined intrathoracic and intraabdominal approaches airway injury\nABBREVIATIONS: ET = endotracheal; PDT = percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy; SEMS = self-expanding metallic stent\nAFFILIATIONS: From the Respiratory Institute (Drs Grewal, Gildea, and Mehta), Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH; the Neurocritical Care Division (Dr Dangayach), Mount Sinai Health System, New York, NY; Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (Dr Ahmad), Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH; and the Radiology Institute (Dr Ghosh), Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.\nCORRESPONDENCE TO: Atul C.

Tracheobronchial injury may occur during rigid bronchoscopy, but the incidence is unknown. 19 Airway injury related to endobronchial and esophageal ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration is extremely rare. 20-22 Tracheobronchial mucosal laceration during balloon dilation for benign strictures may occur in almost one-half of cases, yet rarely extends transmurally. 23 Self-expandable metal stent placement and removal can be complicated by airway laceration, bleeding, stent migration, and stent fracture among others. 24-26\nHere we describe risk factors, clinical manifestations, and the present-day treatment of tracheobronchial injuries.

      "content": "A high degree of clinical suspicion, CT imaging, and bronchoscopy, in that order, can help diagnose tracheal injury. Radiographic imaging may reveal pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, or the tracheal tear itself 37,38 (Fig 1). Bronchoscopy remains the ' gold standard ' for the diagnosis of tracheal injury. Bronchoscopy not only helps in identifying the exact location and size of the injury but may also help in treatment of the injury. 39,40 In endotracheally intubated patients the ET cuff may cover the injured portion of the trachea and hinder assessment of the extent of tracheal injury. For this reason such patients usually receive diagnoses of tracheal injury only after extubation. In cases with a high suspicion of tracheal injury, the cuff may be de /uniFB02 ated during bronchoscopic evaluation and manipulated to visualize the tracheal injury and to assess its extent and severity. In the event of a complete laceration of the tracheal wall, it is important to assess for concomitant esophageal injury. This may require upper gastroenterologic endoscopy and/or CT chest imaging with oral contrast to identify esophageal leak and pneumomediastinum. 41 Acute mediastinitis can be diagnosed on chest CT imaging with signs such as increased attenuation of the mediastinal fat pad and mediastinal /uniFB02 uid collection. 42",

      "content": "The anterior trachea, including the cartilage, or the ligamentous portions between the tracheal rings, are most commonly injured during penetrating trauma. 37 Most traumatic tracheobronchial injuries take place within 2.5 cm of the carina, and mainstem bronchial injuries comprise more than 85% of these injuries. 43 The most frequent cause of penetrating tracheobronchial injuries is gunshot wounds. These injuries could occur in any region of the respiratory tract. 44 Patients with gunshot wounds to the lower one-third of the trachea usually suffer from fatal injuries to the heart or great vessels and die before reaching trauma centers. 45 ET intubation-related iatrogenic injury tends to be a longitudinal tear involving the membranous portion of both the cervical and intrathoracic segments of the trachea. 37 On the other hand, injury due to ET tube cuff overin /uniFB02 ation occurs predominantly in the proximal trachea. 6,11\nIn a prospective study involving adult patients with postintubation tracheobronchial laceration, Cardillo et al 46 proposed a morphologic classi /uniFB01 cation (Table 3, Figs 2 and 3).

The role of prophylactic antibiotics remains unclear because of the lack of evidence. In this regard, most studies have not distinguished level II from level III injuries. Treatment has been described on the basis of clinical presentation and extent of tracheobronchial injury rather than the depth of the injury. 1,11,25,26,35,36,39-41\nPatients with tracheobronchial injuries with either mediastinal, soft tissue, or esophageal involvement (level III injuries) require multidisciplinary evaluation to\ndetermine which patients need emergency vs modern minimally invasive approaches such as airway stent deployment. 24,47,48 The best outcome can be achieved with a multidisciplinary approach inclusive of critical care, surgery, and interventional pulmonary teams.\nPatients with acute respiratory failure, or acute decompensation after extubation, may require reintubation under bronchoscopic guidance to place the cuff of the endotracheal tube beyond the site of the injury. Bronchoscopy is essential to prevent the formation of a false track or worsening the extent the tracheal tear. 49 If a patient fails mechanical ventilatory support because of the underlying injury, advanced life support with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be required as a bridge to recovery 50 and/or de /uniFB01 nitive surgical intervention 51-54 (Fig 4).",

      "content": "There are no speci /uniFB01 c guidelines regarding the surgical treatment of tracheobronchial injury. Traditionally, most experts have agreed that patients with tracheal tears longer than 4 cm in length and those who deteriorate clinically should be treated surgically (Table 4). 33,39,55,56 In a retrospective study of tracheobronchial injuries, 39 of 50 patients had iatrogenic injury; of these 30 patients were treated by open surgical repair while the rest were treated conservatively. The authors concluded that surgery should be the primary mode of treatment for postiatrogenic airway injury, and only in a selected minority should conservative therapy be used. 57 In a retrospective case series involving 11 patients with\nModi /uniFB01 ed with permission from Cardillo et al. 46\n]\niatrogenic tracheobronchial injury nine underwent primary surgical repair. There was no difference in mortality or morbidity between surgical vs conservative treatment. 58\nIn patients who have worsening subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax, development of persistent air leak, and/or failure of lung reexpansion despite chest tube placement, emergency surgical treatment is required. Other indications for emergency surgical treatment include esophageal wall prolapse into the tracheal lumen, and/or ineffective mechanical ventilation in the setting of tracheobronchial injury distal to the\nplacement of the ET tube. We could apply the classi /uniFB01 cation developed by Cardillo et al 46 for tracheobronchial injury due to ET intubations to other forms of iatrogenic injury. Based on this classi /uniFB01 cation surgical treatment is indicated for level IIIA and IIIB injuries.\nWhen a tracheal tear is detected intraoperatively during cardiothoracic surgery, it is best to treat it surgically. 1,11,50 The surgical approach depends on a variety of factors including location of the tracheal injury, whether it is in the proximal one-third to twothirds vs distal one-third of the trachea extending to the main bronchus; and the presence or absence of\nconcomitant vascular injury or injury to adjacent organs. For each surgical approach it is important to gain excellent exposure to examine the surrounding vessels for injury.\nSurgical approaches range from a right thoracotomy as a more traditional approach, a transcervical approach /uniFB01 rst described by Angelillo-Mackinlay 59 in 1995, and a more recent combined transcervical-transtracheal approach that includes a tracheal T-shaped incision. 60 If tracheal injury involves the proximal one-third to two-thirds then the tear can be repaired via cervicotomy. A low cervical collar incision is made that provides excellent exposure to examine vascular or esophageal injuries. 61 This approach is preferred because of its ef /uniFB01 cacy and minimal invasiveness. 32,62\nIf the middle one-third of the trachea is injured, then the manubrium may need to be split, using a T incision, to examine any concomitant vascular injury. This can be used instead of a median sternotomy. Injuries of the left mainstem bronchus are most easily approached through a left thoracotomy. Tracheobronchial injury in the lower one-third of the trachea extending to the carina, main bronchus, or just a few centimeters beyond the carina will need a right thoracotomy with or without a cervicotomy. The extensive thoracosternotomy or bilateral thoracosternotomy or ' clamshell ' incision described in penetrating trauma tracheobronchial injury is usually not needed for iatrogenic injuries.\nIn a case series of 11 patients, Mussi et al 62 described successful surgical repair in nine patients. They used a modi /uniFB01 cation of the transcervical approach /uniFB01 rst described by Angelillo-Mackinlay. In the original\ntranscervical repair, Angelillo-Mackinlay 59 described a cervical mediastinoscopy-like approach by making a vertical incision in the anterior wall of the trachea.",

Other suggested criteria for conservative treatment include the following: absence of esophageal injury, minimal mediastinal air, and nonprogressive pneumomediastinum or subcutaneous emphysema. 41 Previously it was unclear whether patients with tracheal tears between 2 and 4 cm should be treated surgically or conservatively. This can be better determined now and based on the anatomy, clinical status, comorbidities, and on-site expertise.\n1,11,32,41,63\nClinical parameters that should be assessed periodically in this population include stability of subcutaneous emphysema and stable respiratory status (eg, continued spontaneous ventilation or mechanical ventilation without dif /uniFB01 culties). For patients receiving mechanical ventilation, one must ensure that the ET tube cuff is positioned distal to the site of injury with bronchoscopic guidance. In cases of tracheal tear extending to the carina, single lung ventilation can be attempted with selective intubation of left or right mainstem bronchus. Ventilator management should include minimizing airway pressures and positive end-expiratory pressure. 39 Eroglu et al 64 described a case of endoscopic primary repair of severe injury to the posterior tracheal wall through a preexisting tracheal stoma under direct visualization through a /uniFB01 beroptic telescope. If there is concomitant esophageal injury, oral intake and placement of nasogastric/orogastric feeding tubes should be avoided to allow healing and to prevent aspiration of food particles.

Second, there may be an exuberant in /uniFB02 ammatory response with granulation tissue formation that could potentially augment closure of the tracheal defect. A SEMS can also hold more complex shapes down the length of the trachea or bronchi. Such contouring is dif /uniFB01 cult to achieve with silicone stents (Fig 3). The principle behind this approach is similar to that used in the treatment of tracheobronchial dehiscence following lung transplantation. Tracheal stent placement can be used successfully even in cases that would have been historically treated via a surgical approach. 47,48,65,66 After 4 to 6 weeks of adequate healing these stents can be removed. 24,67-71 The complications associated with long-term stent placement for tracheal injury repair are similar to those for other indications. These include, but are not limited to, infection, stent migration, metal fatigue, granulation tissue formation leading to tracheal stenosis, and mucus plugging. 67,72-75 Hence, these stents should be removed as soon as healing of the tear is noted. Rarely, replacement of a fresh stent may be required because of overwhelming granulation tissue formation compromising the stent ' s patency and safe removal. In poor surgical candidates, bene /uniFB01 ts of minimally invasive interventional techniques appear to far outweigh the risk of complications. There have been reports of successful placement of multiple SEMSs or silicone Y-stents in patients with injury that extends beyond the trachea. 47 In cases where a tracheostomy is part of the injury it may be dif /uniFB01 cult or impossible to place a stent since it may lead to closure of the tracheal stoma.\nWe prefer a SEMS when possible given several theoretical advantages as highlighted above, which should be balanced by potential risks of injury on removal. A covered stent is typically preferred and will be required if there is a persistent air leak or worsening subcutaneous emphysema. We recommend that these patients be evaluated at high-volume centers on a caseby-case basis for appropriate patient and procedure selection.",

      "content": "Injury to the tracheobronchial tree may not be preventable in the setting of blunt or penetrating trauma. However, in cases of iatrogenic injury, prevention is the key. Appropriate training for practitioners who perform endotracheal intubation can help prevent multiple failed attempts. It is well known that the dif /uniFB01 culty of intubation increases with each\nunsuccessful attempt and predicts failure on subsequent attempts. 76 Appropriate training and education of support staff, including respiratory therapists and nurses, regarding preparation of the ET tube; stylet positioning; and proper maintenance of the ET tube, including de /uniFB02 ation of the cuff prior to tube repositioning or manipulation, are mandatory. The stylet should never extend beyond the tip of the ET tube during intubation to prevent trauma to the upper airways as well as the posterior tracheal wall. Appropriate use of muscle relaxants and sedation prior to the intubation should facilitate the procedure and prevent any injury.\nSurgical procedure-speci /uniFB01 c training, risk factor assessment for airway injury, and preoperative planning on how to deal with any inadvertent airway injury should be developed by the surgical and anesthesia teams. In patients undergoing esophagectomy for cancer, preoperative bronchoscopy should be performed to look for evidence of tracheal invasion by the tumor for surgical planning. 18 Judicious use of cautery to prevent injury in and around the trachea in head and neck surgeries may help prevent tracheal necrosis.\nThe American College of Chest Physicians, American Thoracic Society, and European Respiratory Society have made recommendations for appropriate training in performing bronchoscopy. These recommendations include the type of training and minimum number of procedures required to gain and maintain competency in performing bronchoscopy. Adherence to such recommendations could help in preventing tracheobronchial injuries. 77 Tracheobronchial injury during placement and removal of SEMSs can be prevented by careful radiographic and/or bronchoscopic assessment of the tracheobronchial anatomy. 24-26 Prior to performing balloon bronchoplasty for airway stenosis, practitioners must review radiographic images to carefully determine the length of stenosis, select appropriate candidates and preplan the procedure to minimize complications. 78\nIn cases of PDT appropriate patient selection is a key. A bedside checklist similar to an operating room check should be used for patients undergoing bronchoscopyguided PDT to help reduce complications. 79 Bronchoscopic guidance can help prevent airway injury by facilitating correct median puncture of the trachea and appropriate withdrawal of the endotracheal tube. 80 Iatrogenic tracheobronchial injury is preventable, and the incidence can be reduced by appropriate procedurespeci /uniFB01 c training and patient selection.",

In their study, the overall mortality was 22% (n ¼ 40/182), but this was felt to be due to the underlying cause for respiratory failure rather than being directly related to the tracheobronchial injury. 1 Superimposed mediastinitis increases mortality. 1 For patients with a delayed diagnosis of tracheobronchial injury and undergoing surgical repair, mortality rises twofold. This mortality can be as high as 70% in critically ill patients, especially when surgical repair is needed. 39,81\nPatients may need long-term follow-up for complications due to the initial injury and therapeutic interventions such as dilatation of post-tracheal injury stenosis.
