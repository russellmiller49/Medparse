    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: It remains challenging to safely and reliably biopsy peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs). Robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (RAB) is gaining adoption for navigation to PPLs. However, evidence from large studies remains limited. RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the clinical safety, navigational success, and diagnostic yield of RAB for biopsy of PPLs in a broad range of patients in a real-world setting? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This multicenter, prospective, single-arm study enrolled patients aged > 21 years with 8- to 50-mm lung lesions requiring bronchoscopic diagnosis. The primary end point was the incidence of the following device- or procedure-related events: (1) pneumothorax requiring intervention; (2) bleeding requiring intervention; or (3) respiratory failure. Secondary end points included individual components of the primary end point, procedure time, pneumothoraces, radial probe endobronchial ultrasound confirmation, conversion to an alternative biopsy procedure, complications, and diagnostic yield. RESULTS: Among 715 patients at 21 sites, 679 met study criteria and underwent RAB (mean age 68.7 years; 55.4% female; 86.5% White; 77.5% with current/past tobacco use). Mean (range) lesion size was 20.9 (7.0-63.0) mm; median (interquartile range) distance from the pleural surface was 5 (0-16) mm. Most lesions were solid (n = 587 [86.6%]) and within the outer two-thirds of the lung (n = 593 [87.5%]). The primary end point was observed in 26 (3.8%) patients (19 pneumothorax, 7 bleeding, and 0 respiratory failure). Users reported that RAB reached the lesion in 670 (98.7%) of 679 cases, and lesion location was confirmed with radial probe endobronchial ultrasound in 607 (91.7%) of 662 cases; sampling through the bronchoscope was performed in 675 (99.4%) of 679 cases. Prevalence of malignancy was 64.1% through 12 months. Adjudicated diagnostic yield was 61.6% when calculated with the American Thoracic Society/American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) definition for strict reporting criteria. Sensitivity for malignancy was 78.8%. INTERPRETATION: This multicenter prospective study of RAB-to our knowledge, the largest to date-showed that RAB-guided sampling of PPLs is safe and compares favorably to results from sizable non-robotic bronchoscopy studies.

Advances in molecular biology have improved the understanding of lung cancer and have changed treatment approaches. 3 Biopsies that enable histologic characterization and mutation analysis are becoming increasingly important. 4 However, biopsy of peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs) remains a challenge due to the ability to gain access to the periphery of the lung, lesion size, locations that are dif /uniFB01 cult to access via standard bronchoscopy, and acquisition of an adequate sample once the lesion is reached. 5 Despite technological development over the past 2 decades, the diagnosis of pulmonary nodules remains suboptimal, with diagnostic yield (DY) reported between 40% and 70%. 6-11 Robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (RAB) was developed to overcome the challenges of reaching and sampling PPLs. RAB systems allow users to control robotic arms with a remote device to navigate to the PPLs for biopsy.\nA robotic-assisted endoscopy system (MONARCH Platform; Johnson & Johnson MedTech) was designed to provide bronchoscopic visualization and airway access for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The system aids in navigation, combining continuous bronchoscopic visualization with a three-dimensional reconstruction of the lung. It has been assessed in small clinical feasibility studies. 12,13 This prospective multicenter study was conducted to evaluate the safety, navigational success, and diagnostic yield of RAB with biopsy in a broad range of participants with PPLs.",

      "content": "The introduction of robotic bronchoscopy has led to questions regarding its safety, diagnostic ability, utility, and cost effectiveness. Several smaller trials have suggested that robotic bronchoscopy can accomplish all of these goals 12,17,18 ; however, larger, prospective trials have yet to be reported. The data presented here from this large, multicenter, prospective trial show that robotic bronchoscopy is safe, with a side effect pro /uniFB01 le similar to that of other navigational bronchoscopy trials.\nThe AE rate was low. The rate of procedure-related pneumothorax (2.8%) and tube thoracostomy (2.2%) was low, despite a substantial proportion of the targeted lesions close to or touching the pleural surface. The pneumothorax rate mirrors rates of pneumothorax in many previously reported bronchoscopy studies. 8,13,19-24 This minimal pneumothorax rate is favorable compared with reported CT-guided biopsy pneumothorax rates of 15% to 30% and 6% chest tube placement. 25 In addition, transthoracic needle aspiration does not offer staging information of primary lung lesions and has been associated with postprocedure hospitalization. 25,26 There were no procedure- or device-related reports of respiratory failure or infection.\nThe diagnostic yield of RAB was 61.6% according to strict reporting criteria, de /uniFB01 ned recently by the ATS/\nCHEST reporting guidelines. 17,27,28 A previous multicenter pilot study of RAB (the Robotic Bronchoscopy for Peripheral Pulmonary Lesions: A Multicenter Pilot and Feasibility Study [BENEFIT] trial) reported a DY of 74% or, using the strict criteria, 17 a DY of 66.7%, which was substantiated by a retrospective study reporting a yield of 77%. 29 The larger prospective multicenter trial presented here corroborates these results; using the BENEFIT calculation, DY in this trial was 73.1%. The results reported here compare favorably to the ACCP Quality Improvement Registry, Evaluation, and Education registry (581 patients), in which the yield of navigational bronchoscopy was 53.7% using the strict de /uniFB01 nition. 24 Despite innovations in bronchoscopic techniques, the diagnosis of PPLs remains a signi /uniFB01 cant clinical challenge. A meta-analysis of guided bronchoscopy, including robotic bronchoscopy, reported an aggregate DY of 70% in > 16,000 patients, re /uniFB02 ecting heterogeneous DY de /uniFB01 nitions. 11 Interestingly, despite innovations, this yield had not improved over the previous decade compared with a prior, similar meta-analysis. 9\nDebate continues on how to evaluate new diagnostic technology in bronchoscopy. Vachani et al 27,28 have shown that using various reporting methods and differing populations can have dramatic effects on the DY that has been described by bronchoscopy trials in the past. In this trial, DY ranged from 61.6% to 84.6% with different DY de /uniFB01 nitions. It has recently been shown that the strict de /uniFB01 nition of DY is highly predictive of diagnostic accuracy through 2 years. 30 With the publication of the new ATS/CHEST guideline, we have for comparison re-analyzed the results of another large, prospective trial of electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy (ENB), the Clinical\n[\n]\nEvaluation of superDimension Navigation System for Electromagnetic Navigation Bronchoscopy (NAVIGATE) trial. 19 Using the ATS/CHEST strict reporting guidelines, the DY within the NAVIGATE trial was 48.7% (613 of 1,260), which is striking\ncompared with the reported liberal DY after 12-month follow-up of 73%. In comparison, the DY in the study reported here using the ATS strict calculation was 61.6%, and using the NAVIGATE de /uniFB01 nition it was 84.6%.\nFigure 2 -Lesion frequency by lobe.\nInitial evaluations in human cadaver lungs revealed that RAB, despite having diameter dimensions similar to standard /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopes, was able to access further into the lung periphery and into locations that were dif /uniFB01 cult to access with /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopy due to angulation. 31 Cadaver studies have also reported that RAB was superior to ENB and standard bronchoscopy with R-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) in its ability to localize and precisely puncture the lesion. 32 The ability to manipulate the scope seems important when factors such as scope-tolesion distance and R-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) probe localization are likely\nrelated to increased DY. The ability to reach the lesion and identify the lesion via R-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) in > 90% of this cohort are both indicators of successful navigation. The results reported here, however, like other trials, have presented a rate of DY that is lower than the rate of localization. 33 This discordance has also been found in older studies of /uniFB02 uoroscopy-guided R-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), in which successful lesion localization was reported in > 95% of the cases; however, DYs were 58% to 69%. 10,34 This discordance may re /uniFB02 ect a variety of factors, including variation in tools.\nFactors associated with DY are not surprising when looking across DY de /uniFB01 nitions and considering univariate or multivariate exploratory analyses. History of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)/emphysema, presence of bronchus sign, and\nCBCT ¼ cone-beam CT; Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) ¼ endobronchial ultrasound; R-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) ¼ radial endobronchial ultrasound.\nd Ability to localize targeted lesion with R-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) for subsolid nodule was summarized with number of patients with subsolid nodules in morphologic features (n ¼ 83).\nData on AEs reported within 7 days of the procedure are included; serious AEs were monitored from enrollment through study exit. AE ¼ adverse event; CTCAE ¼ Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.\na All percentages were calculated by using the number of patients in the full analysis set as the denominator.\nb CTCAE version 5.0 grades (abbreviated; full details are provided in e-Table 2): Grade 1: Mild, intervention not indicated; Grade 2: Moderate, minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; Grade 3: Severe or medically signi /uniFB01 cant but not immediately life-threatening, hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated; and Grade 5: Death related to AE.\nd CTCAE Grades were only applicable for patients who experienced procedure- or device-related pneumothorax, signi /uniFB01 cant bleeding, respiratory failure, or infections.\n[\n]\nlesion size > 20 mm were associated with DY. Nodule diameter and bronchus sign were also found to be associated with DY within the most comprehensive meta-analysis published on this subject. 11 When using the strict DY de /uniFB01 nition, a higher probability of cancer was associated with increased DY, a factor previously reported in a secondary analysis of another trial. 35 Solid nodule CT pattern was associated with increased DY\nwhen using the intermediate DY de /uniFB01 nition. This raises the question of how the probability of cancer and solid nodule CT patterns in Transbronchial Biopsy Assisted by Robot Guidance in the Evaluation of Tumors of the Lung Trial (TARGET) compare with NAVIGATE as well as other navigational bronchoscopy trials. Ability to obtain concentric R-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) images of the lesion was associated with DY in univariate analysis but was not\nNOS ¼ not otherwise speci /uniFB01 ed; Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) ¼ non-small cell lung cancer.\nincluded in multivariate analyses due to missing data. The use of CBCT guidance (113 patients [17%]) was not associated with an increased DY. It is unclear whether CBCT imaging may have been used selectively in more challenging lesions, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn from this result. In addition, nodule to pleural distance and lung zone location (proximal, middle, or peripheral) did not affect DY.\nTo our knowledge, the current study is the largest RAB study to date and includes academic and community centers, providing generalizable estimates of safety and effectiveness in real-world clinical practice. This study was prospectively designed and included adjudication by independent steering committee members of both safety and key ef /uniFB01 cacy end points, including prespeci /uniFB01 ed\ncategorization of index pathology reports. We are not aware of other large multicenter DY studies that included adjudication. Adjudication adds rigor, as evidenced by a differential estimate of DY. The investigator-reported DY was 83.2%, compared with the adjudicated DY of 61.6% (strict de /uniFB01 nition). There was high agreement between adjudicators and investigators on malignant diagnoses. Most discrepancies were related to benign abnormalities. For example, patients with nonspeci /uniFB01 c in /uniFB02 ammation or atypical cells were adjudicated as nondiagnostic, whereas in some cases, local investigators had considered such /uniFB01 ndings diagnostic. The ATS/CHEST consensus statement, which recommends that nonspeci /uniFB01 c in /uniFB02 ammation and atypical cells should be considered nondiagnostic, was\n[\n]\n(Continued)",

These observations highlight the need for more consistency in reporting biopsy /uniFB01 ndings in future bronchoscopy studies. We provide DY results based on multiple approaches commonly used in the literature, allowing comparison of our study results and aligned with the statement by ATS/CHEST on the Assessment of Advanced Diagnostic Bronchoscopy Outcomes for Peripheral Lung Lesions. 17\nA substantial proportion of patients had both staging Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and RAB, an advantage of a single bronchoscopy procedure, with most patients having staging Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) following RAB. Future research may explore whether positive rapid on-site evaluation on linear Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) affects the decision to proceed with RAB, and whether there may be a resulting impact to cost-effectiveness or atelectasis.\nThere are limitations to the current trial, including that this was a single-arm observational study. In addition, although there were both academic and communitybased centers in this study, making the /uniFB01 ndings generalizable, the decision to proceed with bronchoscopic diagnosis of lung lesions may not have been uniform among sites, and there was varying experience of investigators with the RAB technology. Sites began enrolling at various times during the enrollment period, and sites enrolled an average of 3.4 patients per site per month; 5% of screened patients were excluded, and it is possible that some eligible patients may have been omitted due to limited investigator time or research support during the pandemic years. The small number of CBCT users makes interpretation of the DY associated with this technology premature. Future studies should consider randomized trials comparing RAB vs other bronchoscopic platforms (eg, R-RBUS) or CT-guided biopsy for diagnosis of PPLs.\nThe /uniFB01 eld continues to struggle with increasing the DY for peripheral bronchoscopy reliably > 70%, particularly in those with small lesions. 11 Future research efforts\nshould remain directed at methods that help with tissue acquisition as well as evaluation of the most appropriate tools for diagnostic biopsy. A randomized trial of ENB vs CT-guided biopsy of PPL, the Navigation Endoscopy to Reach Indeterminate Lung Nodules vs Transthoracic Needle Aspiration (VERITAS) trial, 36 has completed enrollment and has reported noninferiority of ENB. As we work to improve DY of pulmonary nodules, additional outcomes are likely more important to patients and overall care goals. There are currently very few studies assessing the need for salvage procedures, delay in patient care, and overall costs to patients and the health care system.",
