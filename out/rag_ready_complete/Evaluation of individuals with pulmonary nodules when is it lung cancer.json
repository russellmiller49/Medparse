In the individual with a nonsolid (pure ground glass) nodule measuring ≤ 5 mm in diameter, we suggest no further evaluation (Grade 2C) .\n6.5.2. In the individual with a nonsolid (pure ground glass) nodule measuring . 5 mm in diameter, we suggest annual surveillance with chest CT for at least 3 years (Grade 2C) .\nRemark: CT surveillance of nonsolid nodules should use noncontrast techniques with thin sections through the nodule of interest.\n4.6.2.1.1. In the individual with a solid, indeterminate nodule that measures . 8 mm in diameter, we suggest nonsurgical biopsy in the following circumstances (Grade 2C) :\n· When clinical pretest probability and fi  ndings on imaging tests are discordant\n· When the probability of malignancy is low to moderate (~ 10% to 60%)\n· When a benign diagnosis requiring specifi  c medical treatment is suspected\n· When a fully informed patient desires proof of a malignant diagnosis prior to surgery, especially when the risk of surgical complications is high.\nRemark: The type of biopsy should be selected based on nodule size, location, and relation to a patent airway; the risk of complications in the individual patient; and available expertise.\n4.6.3.1.1.

In the individual with a solid nodule that measures ≤ 8 mm in diameter and no risk factors for lung cancer, we suggest that the frequency and duration of CT surveillance be chosen according to the size of the nodule (Grade 2C) :\n· Nodules measuring ≤ 4 mm in diameter need not be followed, but the patient should be informed about the potential benefi  ts and harms of this approach\ne96S\nOne or More Additional Nodules Detected During Nodule Evaluation\n7.1.1. In the individual with a dominant nodule and one or more additional small nodules, we suggest that each nodule be evaluated individually and curative treatment not be denied unless there is histopathological confi  rmation of metastasis (Grade 2C) .\nRemark: The classifi  cation and appropriate treatment of patients with more than one pulmonary focus of lung cancer is diffi  cult and requires multidisciplinary consideration.\nP ulmonary nodules are small, focal, rounded radiographic  opacities  that  may  be  solitary  or  multiple. By defi  nition, the solitary pulmonary nodule is a single, well-circumscribed, radiographic opacity that measures up to 3 cm in diameter and is surrounded completely by aerated lung. 2,3  There is no associated atelectasis, hilar enlargement, or pleural effusion. Individuals  with  solitary  nodules  are  typically  asymptomatic. Focal pulmonary lesions that are . 3 cm in diameter are called lung masses and are presumed to represent bronchogenic carcinoma until proven otherwise. The management of individuals who present with lung masses and symptomatic nodules are discussed elsewhere. 4\nWe exclude from consideration individuals with diffuse or multiple nodules, arbitrarily defi  ned as those with . 10 nodules. Diffuse nodules are more likely to be accompanied by symptoms and caused by either metastasis from extrathoracic malignancies or active infection or infl  ammation. Because they rarely represent bronchogenic carcinoma, they will not be discussed further. However, we include abnormalities that appear as a single dominant nodule accompanied by one or more smaller, incidental nodules, which are increasingly common and may represent the new normal given that they may be present in ≥ 50% of patients having thin-section chest CT scans. We use the term 'dominant' to refer to a nodule that manifests in this pattern.\nWe further distinguish small, subcentimeter nodules from larger nodules because nodules that measure ≤ 8 mm in diameter are much less likely to be malignant, typically defy accurate characterization by imaging tests, and often are diffi  cult to approach by nonsurgical biopsy. We also distinguish solid nodules from subsolid nodules. Subsolid nodules are further categorized as pure ground glass or part solid in attenuation.\nThroughout this article, we use the term 'indeterminate' to describe a nodule that is not calcifi  ed in a benign pattern or that does not have other features\nRemark: Nonsolid nodules that grow or develop a solid component are often malignant, prompting further evaluation and/or consideration of resection.\nRemark: Early follow-up at 3 months may be indicated for nonsolid nodules measuring . 10 mm (followed by nonsurgical biopsy and/or surgical resection for nodules that persist).\nRemark: Limited  duration  or  no  follow-up  may  be preferred by individuals with life-limiting comorbidities in whom a low-grade malignancy would be of little consequence or by others who place a high value on avoiding treatment of possibly indolent lung cancer.\nPart-Solid ( . 50% Ground Glass) Nodules\n6.5.3. In the individual with a part-solid nodule measuring ≤ 8  mm  in  diameter,  we  suggest CT surveillance at approximately 3, 12, and 24 months, followed by annual CT surveillance for an additional 1 to 3 years (Grade 2C) .\nRemark: CT surveillance of part-solid nodules should use noncontrast techniques with thin sections through the nodule of interest.\nRemark: Part-solid nodules that grow or develop a solid component are often malignant, prompting further evaluation and/or consideration of resection.\nRemark: Limited duration or no follow-up may be preferred by individuals with life-limiting comorbidities in whom a low-grade malignancy would be of little consequence or by others who place a high value on avoiding treatment of possibly indolent lung cancer.",

Our updated literature review identifi  ed 18 potentially relevant studies of chest radiography published since 2005, including six studies of dual-energy techniques, nine studies of computer-assisted detection, and four studies of other methods to improve nodule detection (Table S2). However, none of the studies examined whether specifi  c chest radiographic features were helpful in characterizing nodules as malignant or benign.\nOccasionally, a presumptive benign diagnosis can be established when a characteristic pattern of calcifi  cation is noted on the chest radiograph. Diffuse, central, laminated, and popcorn patterns of calcifi  cation are considered to be benign. 7,8  Although often missing, the presence of intranodular fat density and popcorn calcifi  cation are specifi  c for hamartoma. 9 If one of these patterns of calcifi  cation is clearly evident on the chest radiograph, no additional evaluation is necessary. However, other patterns of calcifi  cation, including the stippled and eccentric patterns, do not exclude malignancy. Further evaluation of these nodules is considered mandatory.",

      "content": "As is true for nodules identifi  ed by chest radiography, all previous CT scans should be reviewed when a nodule is fi  rst identifi  ed by CT scan. Chest CT scan also provides specifi  c information about the location, shape, margins, and attenuation characteristics of nodules. In addition, CT scan sometimes identifi  es unsuspected lymphadenopathy, synchronous parenchymal lesions, or invasion of the chest wall or mediastinum. Selected morphologic characteristics are described next. We discuss nodule size and attenuation characteristics (solid vs subsolid) in greater detail in a subsequent section.\nMorphologic characteristics on chest CT scan that suggest malignancy include spiculated margins 10-12 ; vascular convergence (which suggests vascular and\nstrongly suggestive of a benign etiology, such as intranodular fat that is pathognomonic of hamartoma or a feeding artery and vein typical for arteriovenous malformation. Our recommendations apply only to indeterminate nodules. We do not distinguish screeningdetected nodules from nodules that are detected incidentally, nor do we distinguish nodules that are detected by chest radiography vs chest CT scan. When evaluating individuals with lung nodules, it is more important to consider the size and morphology of the lesions as well as risk factors for malignancy and suitability for curative treatment.\nWe begin by updating recommendations from the second edition of these guidelines for individuals with solid nodules measuring . 8 mm in diameter (including both solitary and dominant nodules). Next, we update recommendations for evaluating solid nodules measuring ≤ 8 mm. Finally, we present a new set of recommendations for individuals with subsolid nodules.\nMost of the evidence described in this article comes from uncontrolled studies  of  diagnostic  accuracy. Although many were methodologically rigorous, all were limited by the use of accuracy as a surrogate outcome. Few randomized controlled trials or studies of higher-level outcomes have been performed. As a result, most of the recommendations are based on evidence that is relatively low in quality. 5",

      "content": "To update previously published guidelines for evaluation of individuals with pulmonary nodules, 6  we repeated prior searches of MEDLINE for studies of chest CT imaging, PET imaging, and transthoracic needle biopsy (TTNB) and performed new searches for studies of subsolid nodules, bronchoscopy, surgical complications, and methods to detect nodule growth (Appendix S1). All searches  were  performed  in  October  2011  and  subsequently updated through May 2012. We identifi  ed additional articles by searching our own personal fi  les and by reviewing reference lists of included studies. We included all randomized controlled trials, controlled observational studies, uncontrolled studies of diagnostic  accuracy,  and  cross-sectional  studies  that  examined relationships between nodule morphology and outcomes. A multidisciplinary writing committee comprising four pulmonologists, two thoracic surgeons, and one radiologist formulated questions (  Table S1  ), synthesized and reviewed available evidence, developed or revised recommendations, rated the quality of evidence, and graded the strength of the recommendations by using a standardized approach, as described by Lewis et al 1  in 'Methodology for Development of Guidelines for Lung Cancer' in the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) Lung Cancer Guidelines. The writing committee reviewed all recommendations and reached consensus by iterative discussion and debate. The manuscript was extensively revised, although some sections of text (including much of the section on solid nodules measuring ≤ 8 mm in diameter) were considered to be current and, therefore, retained from the previous version. The resulting guideline supersedes the previous version. The guideline was reviewed by all members of the ACCP Lung Cancer Guidelines Panel prior to approval by the Thoracic\navailable to minimize the risks associated with repeated exposures. 24   IV contrast is relatively or absolutely contraindicated in patients with renal insuffi  ciency or allergy to iodine, and it is usually not necessary to administer contrast when performing follow-up CT scans to identify growth.",

      "title": "3.0 Suitability for Surgery or Other Curative-Intent Treatment",
      "content": "Before embarking on a potentially inconvenient, risky, and expensive evaluation, it is important to establish the individual's suitability and desire for curative treatment. Although therapeutic lobectomy frequently is contraindicated in individuals with advanced comorbid  conditions,  relatively  few  individuals  will  be excluded  from  consideration  for  sublobar  resection or other less-invasive treatments (see Brunelli et al 25 'Physiologic Evaluation of the Patient With Lung Cancer Being Considered for Resectional Surgery' in the ACCP Lung Cancer Guidelines). However, some individuals may prefer no treatment, particularly those with life-limiting comorbid conditions. In such individuals, it does not make sense to pursue biopsy or aggressive CT scan surveillance, although it is always prudent to monitor for symptoms that may be palliated.\nFor individuals who desire treatment but either refuse or cannot tolerate surgery (even limited resection), surgical diagnosis is precluded. Other options for evaluation include functional imaging, CT scan surveillance, and nonsurgical biopsy. Prior to beginning nonsurgical treatment, the diagnosis of lung cancer ideally should be confi  rmed by biopsy specimen.\nlymphatic invasion) 13   ;  and either a dilated bronchus leading into the nodule 14  or the presence of pseudocavitation, which has a bubbly appearance believed to represent air bronchiolograms. 12  True cavitation, especially when associated with a thick and irregular wall, is a strong predictor of malignancy. 15\nOur  search  identified  seven  recent  studies  of CT image characteristics (summarized in Appendix S2). One such study of 213 patients with nodules (92% solid) from Denmark confi  rmed many of the distinguishing characteristics fi  rst reported by Siegelman et al 10  and Zerhouni et al. 11  In the Danish study, a malignant (vs benign) diagnosis was more than fi  ve times more likely for nodules with spiculated or ragged margins (likelihood ratio [LR], 5.5), almost twice as likely when pleural retraction was present (LR, 1.9), and 70% more likely when a vessel sign was present (LR, 1.7) but only 10% more likely when margins were lobulated (LR, 1.1). 16  Malignancy was 30% less likely when a bronchus sign was present (LR, 0.7) and fi  ve times less likely for smooth or polygonal margins (LR, 0.2). Noncalcifi  ed nodules were equally likely to be malignant or benign (LR, 1.0). Qualitative assessment and subjective weighting of these features yielded a sensitivity of 98% for identifying malignancy but a specifi  city of only 23%.\nData from the NELSON (Dutch Belgian Randomised Lung Cancer Screening) trial of CT scan screening showed that for solid nodules, malignancy was associated with larger nodule size, spiculated margins, and irregular shape but not with attenuation characteristics. 17   In  this  study,  the combination of round shape, smooth margins, and low attenuation (solid nodule with a negative CT scan number) was 100% predictive of benignity. Two other screening studies reported confl  icting results about potential predictors of resolv  ing (and therefore benign) nodules. 18,19\nOther  studies  have  used  computer-assisted  techniques or novel CT scan parameters to discriminate between malignant and benign nodules, but these have been limited by small size, imprecision, and lack of external validation. 20,21   Consequently, although CT scan morphology often helps to estimate the probability of malignancy, it is rarely conclusive.\nRisks associated with CT scan include radiation exposure and adverse effects because of administration of iodinated contrast material. The risk of radiationinduced cancer is uncertain in magnitude. Most studies used models that are based on nonmedical sources of ionizing radiation and concluded that risks were small but nontrivial at the population level. 22,23 Although controversy exists, less radiation exposure is obviously preferable, and the use of radiation-limiting innovations, including dose modulation and iterative reconstruction techniques, should be used when",

Estimating pretest probability facilitates the selection and interpretation of subsequent diagnostic tests. Common sense argues that different management approaches are called for in a 30-year-old nonsmoker with an 8-mm smooth-bordered nodule and a 70-year-old heavy smoker with a 2.5-cm spiculated nodule. Most individuals with nodules have characteristics that fall somewhere between these two extremes.\nAlthough many clinicians estimate pretest probability intuitively, several quantitative models have been developed to assist in this task, 26,30,31  including four new models developed since 2005 (  Tables S3, S4  ). 27-29,32\nAlternatives to surgical treatment include external beam radiation, stereotactic radiotherapy, and radiofrequency ablation.

The prediction model is described by the following equations  :\n(Equation 2)\nThree models have undergone external validation since 2005 (  Tables S5, S6  ). 33-35   Another used data from the PLCO (Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial) of lung cancer screening with chest radiography and found that although a lung mass (not surprisingly) was highly predictive of malignancy (Odds ratio (OR), 11.2; 95% CI, 6.3-19.9), the fi  nding of a lung nodule was not (Odds ratio (OR), 1.4; 95% CI, 0.8-2.5). 36\nThe most extensively validated model was developed by investigators at the Mayo Clinic who used multiple logistic regression analysis to identify six independent predictors of malignancy in 419 patients with noncalcifi  ed nodules that measured between 4 and 30 mm in diameter on chest radiography.  26,33 Independent predictors of malignancy included older age (OR, 1.04 for each year), current or past smok-\nVATS 5 video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery.\nFDG 5 fl  uorodeoxyglucose; NA 5 not applicable; TTNA 5 transthoracic needle aspiration. a In  three  studies,  independent  risk  factors  for  malignancy  included  older  age,  current  or  former  smoking, history of extrathoracic cancer . 5 y prior to nodule detection, larger nodule diameter, spiculated margins, and upper-lobe location 26 ; older age, current or former smoking, shorter time since quitting smoking, and larger nodule  diameter 27 ;  and  high  serum  C-reactive  protein  level,  high  serum  carcinoembryonic  antigen  level, absence of calcifi  cation, spiculation, and CT scan bronchus sign. 28  In another study, the combination of smooth or lobulated borders, irregular shape, and solid attenuation had a negative predictive value of 86%. 29 b Approximately 20% of observed cancers have decreased in size at least at some point during the observation\nperiod.\nSPECT scan (seven studies).  48  Pooled estimates of sensitivity ranged from 93% for dynamic CT scan to 94% for dynamic MRI to 95% for both PET and SPECT  scans,  whereas  pooled  specifi  city  ranged from 76% for dynamic CT scan to 79% for dynamic MRI to 82% for both PET and SPECT scans. Comparison of summary receiver operating characteristic curves showed that there were no signifi  cant differences in accuracy among all four modalities.\n4.2.3 PET Scanning With Fluorodeoxyglucose: The 2008 meta-analysis 48  yielded an estimate for the sensitivity of PET scan that was somewhat higher (95%) than the estimate of 87% that we reported in the second edition of these guidelines. 6,39  Among more recent studies identifi  ed by our updated literature review, estimates of sensitivity ranged from 72% to 94% (  Table S7  ). 49-54\nA limitation of most studies of diagnostic accuracy is  the  use  of  a  single  threshold  for  distinguishing malignant from benign nodules. A prospective study of 344 US veterans with lung nodules addressed this limitation by reporting LRs ratios for fi  ve different categories of PET results. 55 In this study, LRs for defi  nitely benign, probably benign, indeterminate, probably mali  gnant, and defi  nitely malignant PET results were 0.03 (95% CI, 0.01-0.12), 0.15 (95% CI, 0.09-0.25), 1.01 (95% CI, 1.00-1.02), 3.2 (95% CI, 1.9-5.3), and 9.9 (95% CI, 5.4-18.3), respectively, confi  rming the intuition  that  greater  degrees  of  fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake are more strongly associated with malignancy. In this study, FDG uptake that was slightly greater than that of the mediastinal blood pool was considered to be probably malignant, whereas substantially greater uptake was considered to be defi  nitely malignant. Although indeterminate fi  ndings on PET scan did not help to distinguish malignant from benign nodules, very few participants (1%) had indeterminate fi  ndings.\nSome have proposed using dual time point measurements  of  FDG  uptake  to  improve  diagnostic accuracy (  Table S8  ). However, a systematic review of 816 patients with 890 nodules in 10 studies concluded that dual time point measurement was no better than single time point measurement. 56  In this study, the pooled sensitivity and specifi  city of dualtime FDG-PET scan for identifying malignancy were 85% (95% CI, 82%-89%) and 77% (95% CI, 72%-81%), respectively.\nFalse-negative fi  ndings on PET scan can be seen in patients with less metabolically active tumors, including lepidic-predominant adenocarcinomas (minimally invasive or in situ), mucinous adenocarcinomas, and carcinoid tumors. False-positive fi  ndings often are the result of infections or infl  ammatory conditions, including (but not limited to) endemic mycoses, TB,\nwhere e is the base of natural logarithms, age is the patient's age in years, smoke 5 1 if the patient is a current or former smoker (otherwise 5 0), cancer 5 1 if the patient has a history of an extrathoracic cancer that was diagnosed . 5 years ago (otherwise 5 0), diameter is the diameter of the nodule in millimeters, spiculation 5 1 if the edge of the nodule has spicules (otherwise 5 0), and location 5 1 if the nodule is located in an upper lobe (otherwise 5 0).\nOf note, the accuracy of models for predicting malignancy appears to be similar to that of expert clinicians, although the correlation between models and experts is poor, suggesting that the models may provide unique information. 37,38  The choice of model might best be guided by the characteristics of the target population, ease of use, and the extent of validation.",

Paradoxically, false-positive PET scan results can sometimes be helpful because they alert the clinician to the presence of an active infectious or infl  ammatory condition that might require specifi  c treatment. In some circumstances, FDG-PET scan can be helpful in directing tissue biopsy. As a metabolic biopsy tool, PET scan can identify which lesions or portions of lesions are metabolically active and most likely to yield a defi  nitive tissue result.\nUse  of  FDG-PET  scanning  may  be  most  costeffective when clinical pretest probability and CT scan results are discordant, especially when pretest probability is relatively low and CT image characteristics are indeterminate (ie, not clearly benign). 57  Among patients with indeterminate nodules (by CT scan) and high pretest probability, negative PET scan results do not reliably exclude malignancy. However, FDG uptake in the primary tumor has been shown to be inversely correlated with survival, 58,59  and patients with nonhypermetabolic malignant tumors may have a favorable prognosis, even when defi  nitive surgical treatment is delayed by a period of observation as long as 238 days. 60,61  Hence, patients with solid nodules and negative (nonhypermetabolic) PET scan results are believed to require continued surveillance for at least 2 years to confi  rm benignity. An even more cautious approach would be to perform needle biopsy in high-probability tumors with negative PET scan results.\nIntegrated PET/CT scanners combine CT and FDG imag  ing capability in a single patient gantry, facilitating the precise localization of areas of FDG uptake to normal structures or abnormal soft tissue masses. Of three studies that compared dedicated PET scan with integrated PET/CT scan for pulmonary nodule characterization (  Table S9  ), integrated PET/CT scan was slightly more accurate in two of them, but none of the studies compared integrated PET/CT scan with standard care (side-by-side interpretation  of  dedicated  PET  scan  and  dedicated CT scan). 62-64\nAlthough we view nodule characterization and lung cancer staging as separate indications for PET scanning, we favor PET scan over other functional imag  ing modalities for nodule characterization in part because PET scan often provides additional information about stage among individuals with malignant nodules. Recommendations about the use of PET scanning for staging are described by Silvestri et al 65  in the 'Methods for Staging Non-small Cell Lung Cancer' article in the ACCP Lung Cancer Guidelines.\nAlthough exposure to ionizing radiation from dedicated FDG-PET imaging is at least moderate (about 5-7 mSv), the addition of integrated CT scanning for purposes of attenuation correction and anatomic",

Some individuals may be uncomfortable with adopting a strategy of surveillance when told that a potentially cancerous  lung  nodule  is  present.  Others  are  similarly risk averse about undergoing surgery unless they are certain that cancer is present. 68  All individuals with lung nodules should be provided with an estimate of the probability of cancer and informed about the specifi  c risks and benefi  ts associated with alternative management strategies. Clinicians should elicit preferences for management and be sensitive to the preferred participatory decision-making style of the patient. 69\nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) 5 endobronchial ultrasound; ENB 5 electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy; VBN 5 virtual bronchoscopy navigation.\navoided when the clinical probability of cancer is moderate  to  high;  it  is  most  appropriate  in  individuals with a very low probability of malignancy and in those who are at high risk for complications of surgical resection and nonsurgical biopsy.\nMethods to detect growth on serial CT scans are evolving rapidly (Appendix S4). Manual measurements of diameter are limited by poor reliability and accuracy. In one study of 63 patients with lung nodules and 93 pairs of CT scans, manual and electronic measures of diameter and cross-sectional area incorrectly assessed the presence or absence of growth in 27% to 37% of CT scan pairs compared with a reference standard of manual volumetric measurement. 77\nMeasurement of diameter, therefore, is likely to be supplanted by measurement of volume or mass, but available studies are not yet conclusive, being limited by small samples and retrospective, uncontrolled designs. For example, a small retrospective study of 63 participants (including only 11 participants  with  malignant  nodules)  used  volumetric  software to measure nodules on CT scans performed a median of 3.7 months apart and found that a threshold VDT of . 500 days had a sensitivity of 91% and a specifi  city  of  90% for identifying malignancy. 78 In another small study of 13 malignant ground glass nodules  detected  by  screening  over  a  mean  time  of 33 months between the fi  rst and last CT scans, diameter increased by 53%, volume by 202%, and mass by 254%, with measurements of mass having the largest signal-to-noise ratio, suggesting that measurements of volume or mass may improve detection of growth. 79   Finally, in a study of 69 patients with 87 nodules (92% solid), volumetric measurement of growth changed the management decision from observation to biopsy in seven patients, although only three of these patients were proven to have lung cancer, with VDTs ranging from 347 to 670 days in these three cases. 80\nHowever, size measurements are fraught with error. Various measurement methods of solid nodules all have false-positive and false-negative assessments of growth. 81   There is poor interobserver and intraobserver consistency for size differences of , 1.5 to 2 mm.  82,83  In a study of 100 patients with 233 screeningdetected benign nodules all measuring at least 4.8 mm in diameter, 84   variability in automated volumetric measurements between nodules seen on CT scans performed at baseline, 3 months, and 12 months was ± 27%, and 70% of measurements had volume differences . 10%. Even in phantom studies, there is an error rate of about 20% in determining the presence or absence of one volume doubling for 5-mm nodules with a slice thickness of 2.5 mm. 82  Finally, emerging data suggest that the rate of growth may not be constant and that a decrease in size is observed\ntool. When this strategy is used, detection of growth strongly suggests malignancy, and surgical resection should be performed in patients who are operative candidates. However, very rapidly growing nodules are commonly infectious or infl  ammatory, necessitating estimation of the growth rate. The growth rate typically is expressed in terms of the doubling time, or the time it takes for the nodule to double in volume. Because the volume of a sphere equals 4 p r 3 /3, one doubling in tumor volume corresponds approximately to an increase in nodule diameter of 26%. The doubling time can be calculated by using the formula, dt 5 (t 3 log 2)/[3 3 (log (d 2 /d 1 )], where dt 5 doubling time in days, t 5 time in days between radiographs, d 2 5 diameter of the nodule at the time of the current radiograph, and d 1 5 diameter of the nodule at the time of the previous radiograph. 70\nT wo-year  radiographic stability  is  strong  presumptive evidence of a benign cause because malignant solid nodules typically double in volume within 400 days. 71,72 Longer duration follow-up is advisable for ground glass nodules, which generally have longer volume doubling times (VDTs) when malignant.\nSurveillance  is  virtually  always  performed  with CT scanning, which is more sensitive than chest radiography for detecting growth. Although it may be possible to detect growth on serial chest radiographs when the nodule is large ( . 1.5-2 cm) and has sharp, clearly demarcated borders, the surveillance strategy is seldom used for nodules of this size because of the relatively high probability of malignancy. For solid, indeterminate nodules measuring . 8 mm in diameter, the optimal time interval between imaging tests has not been determined, but standard practice is to obtain follow-up CT scans at about 3 to 6, 9 to 12, and 18 to 24 months. 73  Less-frequent follow-up is indicated in patients with smaller nodules, as discussed in subsequent sections.\nThe advantage of the surveillance strategy in avoiding unnecessary invasive procedures among individuals with benign nodules is weighed against the disadvantage of  delaying  diagnosis  and  treatment among patients with malignant nodules. Depending on the growth rate and metastatic potential of the nodule and the length of surveillance, some malignant tumors will progress from resectable to unresec  table disease during the observation period, and opportunities for surgical cure will be missed. Empirical data relevant to the hazard of delay are scarce, although a Scottish study found that maximum cross-sectional tumor area increased by . 50% in almost 25% of patients who had delays in radiotherapy treatment lasting between 18 and 131 days. 74  In contrast, most studies of timeliness of care in lung cancer did not detect an association between timeliness and survival. 75,76 Nevertheless,  the  surveillance  strategy  should  be",

In general, the sensitivity of TTNB depends on the size of the nodule, the size of the needle (especially for identifying lymphoma or benign disease), the number of needle passes, and the presence of onsite cytopathologic examination. In our previous review, 39  we identifi  ed 11 studies of TTNB performed between 1998 and 2003. In these studies, the prevalence of malignancy was high (median, 75%; range, 63%-85%). Nondiagnostic results were seen in 4% to 41% of cases (median, 20.5%), but specifi  c benign or  malignant  results  were  nearly  always  correct (although not all malignant diagnoses were confi  rmed surgically).\nOur updated literature search identifi  ed 11 additional studies of TTNB for pulmonary nodule diagnosis performed between 2005 and 2011 (  Tables S10-S13  ). Once again, the prevalence of malignancy was high (median, 68%; range, 46%-83%), and the frequency of nondiagnostic results was highly variable, ranging  from , 1%  to  55%,  although  the  median  value was lower than what we found previously (6%). In most studies, sensitivity for identifying malignancy was ≥ 90%, but it was somewhat lower (70%-82%) in three studies that analyzed results for patients with nodules measuring ≤ 15 mm in diameter. 62,86,87  More importantly, a sensitivity of 90% in a high-prevalence population (about 70%) translates to a risk of nondiagnostic  results  in  about  20%  of  individuals  with malignant nodules.\nOur search did not identify any randomized controlled trials comparing TTNB with other approaches, but a 2002 study used case vignettes from 114 patients with solitary nodules (71% malignant) to determine the  frequency  with  which  TTNB results  changed management.  88  In this study, the addition of TTNB results to clinical history and chest CT scan fi  ndings reduced the frequency of missed surgical cure from 10% to 7% and reduced the frequency of unnecessary surgery for a benign lesion from 39% to 15%.\nComplications of TTNB include pneumothorax and hemorrhage. In a population-based study of all TTNB procedures performed in California, Florida, Michigan, and New York in 2006, the risk of hemorrhage was low (1%), but the risks of any pneumothorax (15%) and pneumothorax requiring chest tube insertion (6.6%) were substantial. 89 In this study, risk\nin about 20% of malignant lesions. 85  These issues need to be better understood and standards developed.\nDoubling times for malignant nodules are highly variable, but solid nodules usually have doubling times between 20 and 400 days.

Among the latter studies, diagnostic yield ranged from 44% to 75% (median, 68.5%). Across all 10 studies, the risk of pneumothorax ranged from 0% to 7.5% (median, 2.2%). Stud  ies were limited by small sample sizes, uncertain representativeness of the study populations, and retrospective uncontrolled design.\nA small (n 5 118) randomized controlled trial compared Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBB, ENB, and Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBB plus ENB for diagnostic yield in the absence of fl  uoroscopic guidance. 106  For peripheral lesions of any size, diagnostic yield was higher for the combined procedure (88%) than for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBB (69%) or ENB (59%) alone. Results were similar when the analysis was restricted to nodules measuring 20 to 30 mm in diameter or nodules measuring , 20 mm in diameter.\nMore recently, a randomized controlled trial from three centers in Japan compared VBN-assisted Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) with  nonassisted  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)  for  diagnostic  yield  among 199 individuals with nodules measuring up to 30 mm in diameter. 107  In this trial, diagnostic yield was higher for the VBN-assisted procedure (80%) than for the unassisted procedure (67%).\nA  recent  meta-analysis  identifi  ed  39  studies  of bronchoscopy with biopsy guided by radial Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) (20  studies),  ENB  (11  studies),  guide  sheath (10 studies), ultrathin bronchoscopy (11 studies), or VBN (10 studies). 108  Most studies were prospective but limited by small samples. Across all studies, the pooled diagnostic yield was 70% (95% CI, 67%-73%), with slightly more favorable results for guide sheath (73%) and slightly less favorable results for ENB (67%). Heterogeneity in  study  results  was  identifi  ed  but not entirely explained, although diagnostic yield for nodules  measuring ≤ 20  mm  in  diameter  (61%; 95% CI, 54%-68%) was substantially lower than that for nodules measuring . 20  mm in diameter (82%; 95% CI, 78%-86%). Across 24 studies that reported adverse  events,  the  pooled  risk  of  pneumothorax was 1.6%, and the risk of pneumothorax requiring chest tube placement was 0.7%.\nFor individuals who choose to pursue nonsurgical biopsy, the decision to perform CT scan-guided TTNB; conventional bronchoscopy; or bronchoscopy guided by Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), ENB, or VBN depends on multiple factors. CT  scan-guided  TTNB  is  preferred  for  nodules located in proximity to the chest wall or for deeper lesions provided that fi  ssures do not need to be traversed and there is no surrounding emphysema. Bronchoscopic techniques are favored for nodules located in proximity to a patent bronchus and in individuals who are  at  high  risk  for  pneumothorax  following\nfactors for pneumothorax included age 60 to 69 years, tobacco use, and Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In other single-center studies, risk factors for pneumothorax included older age, 90 smaller lesion size, 91-94  deeper location, 90-96  the need to traverse fi  ssures, 91  the presence of emphysema, 95,96 and the number of needle punctures. 97\nUse of needle biopsy is probably most appropriate when there is discordance among the clinical probability of cancer, imaging test results, patient preferences, and risk of surgical complications, as described in recommendation 4.6.2.1.1  . It is important to emphasize that a nondiagnostic needle biopsy result does not rule out the possibility of malignancy.\n4.6.2 Bronchoscopy: Until recently, bronchoscopy played a limited role in pulmonary nodule management outside investigational settings. In older studies, the sensitivity of fl  uoroscopy-guided bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy (TBB) for identifying malignant nodules measuring , 2  cm in diameter ranged from 5% to 76% (median, 31%).  98  The likelihood of obtaining a specifi  c benign diagnosis is even lower. However, the presence of an air bronchogram in a pulmonary nodule is associated with a higher diagnostic yield, especially if this provides a specifi  c road map to the bronchial location. 99,100\nNewer techniques for bronchoscopic guidance include radial Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) (Appendix S5), ENB (Appendix S6), and VBN. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) facilitates bronchoscopic sampling of smaller peripheral nodules. A recent systematic review identifi  ed 13 studies that reported the sensitivity of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBB for identifying malignancy in 1,090 patients with peripheral lung lesions. 101 For lesions of any size, pooled sensitivity was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.70-0.76); sensitivity was similar when pooled across seven studies that enrolled 580 patients with nodules measuring , 25 mm in diameter (0.71; 95% CI, 0.66-0.75). Studies were limited by low scores for study quality, inconsistent results, and the indirectness that characterizes most studies of diagnostic accuracy (  Fig 5  , Tables S14-S16  ).\nTwo small randomized trials compared Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBB with conventional TBB (  Fig 5  ). In one study, the sensitivity of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBB for identifying malignant nodules measuring ≤ 20 mm was markedly greater than that for conventional TBB (71% vs 23%).  103 However, a subsequent study reported a sensitivity of only 11% for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBB compared with 31% for conventional  TBB  102   perhaps  because  few  of  the participating bronchoscopists had experience with Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS). A pooled analysis of complication rates from both trials neither confi  rmed nor excluded differences between the two tests (relative risk, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.02-14.7) (Fig S1).\nENB  shows  promise  as  another  tool  for  guiding biopsy of peripheral nodules. 104,105  Our literature",

Technetium-99 radioguidance and fl  uoroscopic guidance with contrast material had high sensitivity with few complications. Ultrasonography had a sensitivity of 93% to 100% but is believed to be operator dependent.\nThe diagnosis is most often established by intraoperative consultation with pathology. Frozen section analysis is sensitive and specifi  c for diagnosis of malignancy;  however,  the  technique  has  limitations the surgeon should understand. In one study, the sensitivity for identifying malignancy was 87% for nodules that measured , 1.1 cm in diameter and 94% for nodules that measured between 1.1 and 1.5 cm. 112 The technique has limitations in distinguishing minimally invasive adenocarcinoma or adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) from atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) and in establishing a specifi  c cell type in nonsmall cell carcinoma. It is limited in recognizing small peripheral carcinoid tumors. Lesions measuring , 5 mm should probably not be used for frozen section analysis unless there is other material available for permanent studies. 112\nFor the surgical candidate with a nodule shown to be non-small cell lung cancer, lobectomy and systematic sampling of mediastinal lymph nodes is the standard of care for complete oncologic resection and staging. 113  Minimally invasive techniques are increasingly preferred for lobectomy. Several large contemporary studies reported risks of fatal and nonfatal complications. Among nearly 6,000 individuals from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons database who underwent lobectomy between 1999 and 2006, of whom 30% underwent thorascopic procedures, the reported 30-day mortality was about 2%.  114  Among smaller numbers  of  individuals  who  underwent  bilobectomy and pneumonectomy in this study, the risks of fatal complications were 4% and 6.2%, respectively. More recently, data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample showed in-hospital mortality to be 3.1% among 12,860 individuals who underwent open lobectomy and 3.4% among 759 individuals who underwent VATS lobectomy.  115  An observational study of . 2,500 propensity-matched patients from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons database reported a higher percentage of patients who were free of complications among those who underwent thorascopic lobectomy compared with open lobectomy (74% vs 65%).  116\nFor individuals with marginal cardiac performance or limited pulmonary reserve, sublobar resection can be considered acceptable treatment, although lobectomy has been the standard of care for medically fi  t\nTTNB.

The decision to pursue surgical diagnosis must take into account the benefi  ts  of  defi  nitive  diagnosis  and  treatment  when compared with the surgical risk. Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS), thoracotomy, and mediastinoscopy may be used alone or in combination, depending on the clinical circumstances. If the nodule proves to be a primary lung cancer, diagnosis, staging, and therapeutic resection often are completed in a single operative procedure.\nThoracoscopic wedge resection is the strongly preferred diagnostic approach for nodules. Although less invasive and almost certainly less morbid than open thoracotomy, data on complications of VATS diagnostic wedge resection are sparse. In two small older studies, there were no fatal complications; nonfatal complications occurred in about 5% of patients. 109,110 More recent reports are diffi  cult to interpret because they combine results for diagnostic VATS with VATS lobectomy, often in patients with severe comorbid conditions.\nNodules that are small in size ( , 1 cm), deep in location, and subsolid in attenuation can pose a technical challenge because it may be diffi  cult to fi  nd such nodules by digital palpation.

Given the relatively low prevalence of malignancy, the risks of surgical diagnosis usually outweigh the benefits. Accordingly, solid, subcentimeter nodules are typically followed with serial CT scans.

Although measurement techniques are improving, both manual and computer-assisted methods remain limited by poor reliability and lack of large-scale validation. Other sources of measurement error include breathing artifact and variable patient positioning.\nThe slow growth rates of most subsolid malignant nodules have implications for both the frequency and the duration of follow-up. In most cases, observed growth rates for subsolid malignant nodules range between 400 and 800 days, but doubling times as long as 1,500 days have been reported.  164-167  In a small study of 13 subsolid malignant nodules detected by screening, mean times for growth to be detectable (defi  ned as the upper limit of agreement between readers) were 715, 673, and 425 days for measurements of diameter, volume, and mass, respectively. 79\nadditional nodules. Most of these additional nodules are benign. A study from Japan showed that 10% of patients with suspected lung cancer had a second nodule detected during subsequent evaluation, and 60% of these were benign at surgery. 178 In another study, CT scan detected a second indeterminate nodule in 16% of patients with clinically operable stage I to IIIA non-small cell lung cancer. 179 The nodules ranged in size from 4 to 12 mm, and although many of the nondominant nodules were lost to follow-up, . 85% of those with a defi  nite diagnosis were benign.\nScreening studies provide additional evidence that patients with a malignant nodule commonly will have additional benign nodules. In an uncontrolled study of CT scan screening in New York, 30% of the participants with cancer identifi  ed during baseline (prevalence) screening had one or more additional nodules at the time of detection. 180  None of these were reported to be malignant after follow-up. 181  In the Mayo Clinic screening study, . 50% of the 31 participants with cancer had other nodules detected, and all but one (a  carcinoid tumor) were proven to be benign by absence of growth during follow-up. 182  In these studies, the majority of secondary nodules measured , 4 mm, which implies a very low risk of malignancy. Therefore, although the likelihood of fi  nding one or more additional nodules increases with the use of smaller slice thickness on CT scan, the majority of additional nodules will be benign.\nWhen confronted with one or more additional nodules during nodule evaluation, it is prudent to consider each nodule individually rather than assuming that the additional nodules are either metastatic or benign. Preoperative PET scanning may help in the decision of whether more than one nodule is likely malignant and guide further evaluation, although many of these nodules will be too small to be reliably characterized by PET scan. Above all, candidates for curative treatment with known or suspected malignant nodules who have one or more additional nodules present should not be denied curative therapy unless metastasis is confi  rmed by histopathology.

In the individual with a dominant nodule and one or more additional small nodules, we suggest  that  each  nodule  be  evaluated  individually and curative treatment not be denied unless there is histopathological confi  rmation of metastasis (Grade 2C) .\nRemark: Early  follow-up  at  3  months  may  be  indicated for nonsolid nodules measuring . 10 mm (followed by nonsurgical biopsy and/or surgical resection for nodules that persist).\nRemark: Limited duration or no follow-up may be preferred by individuals with life-limiting comorbidities in whom a low-grade malignancy would be of little consequence or by others who place a high value on avoiding treatment of possibly indolent lung cancer.\n6.5.3. In the individual with a part-solid nodule measuring ≤ 8  mm  in  diameter,  we  suggest CT surveillance  at  approximately  3,  12,  and 24 months, followed by annual CT surveillance for an additional 1 to 3 years (Grade 2C) .\nRemark: CT surveillance of part-solid nodules should use noncontrast techniques with thin sections through the nodule of interest.\nRemark: Part-solid  nodules  that  grow  or  develop  a solid component are often malignant, prompting further evaluation and/or consideration of resection.\nRemark: Limited duration or no follow-up may be preferred by individuals with life-limiting comorbidities in whom a low-grade malignancy would be of little consequence or by others who place a high value on avoiding treatment of possibly indolent lung cancer.",

      "title": "Recommendations for Research",
      "content": "The pulmonary nodule is increasingly common and remains a vexing problem. Individuals with solid nodules measuring . 8 mm should be managed by reviewing old imaging studies; estimating the probability of malignancy; performing imaging tests to better characterize the nodule; evaluating the risks associated with various management alternatives; and eliciting patient preferences for CT scan surveillance, nonsurgical biopsy, or surgical diagnosis. Solid nodules measuring ≤ 8 mm are infrequently malignant, diffi  cult to biopsy, risky to resect, and not reliably characterized by PET scan or other functional imaging tests, leaving CT scan surveillance as the most appropriate option. At this time, the frequency and duration of surveillance are guided by expert consensus-based recommendations from the Fleischner Society. Subsolid nodules often are premalignant or malignant and may require extended-duration surveillance for growth or development of a solid component. Further research is needed to weigh the benefi  ts and harms of alternative methods for evaluating both solid and subsolid nodules. Research priorities include developing and validating risk assessment models to estimate the probability of cancer among individuals with small nodules or subsolid nodules, performing studies that compare the benefi  ts and harms of alternative management strategies  among  individuals  stratifi  ed by cancer risk, determining the safety of CT scan surveillance by examining outcomes among individuals who choose this strategy, and developing and validating novel noninvasive biomarkers to facilitate diagnosis and determine prognosis.",
