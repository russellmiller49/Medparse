A pulmonary function test (PFT) and 6MWT as well as questionnaires regarding dyspnea (modified Medical Research Council [mMRC] dyspnea score) and quality of life (QoL) using St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) were repeated. 16,17 Radiologic  monitoring  was  performed  with  chest radiograph at 30 and 90 days, and a repeat HRCT scan was performed at 3 months. Radiologic definition of atelectasis was total lung parenchymal collapse with the development of a hyperdense tissue area on a lobar, segmental, or subsegmental level. Volume reduction was defi  ned as parenchymal deflation, not necessarily leading to atelectasis.\nPrimary end points were improvement in FEV 1 and 6-min walk distance (6MWD). Secondary end points were changes in SGRQ as well as in all other lung function parameters (RV, TLC, and inspiratory vital capacity [IVC]). Serious complications (pneumothorax, respiratory failure, or death) and migration of valves were used to assess safety.\nStatistical  assessment  was  performed  with  a  software  program (SAS8.2; SAS Institute).

The study protocol had been approved by the ethics committee of the University of Heidelberg (S-288/2009).\nIn all patients, endoscopic lung volume reduction (ELVR) with placement of an IBV was indicated because of their severe emphysema. Heterogeneity and bilateral distribution of the emphysema was proven by native thin-slice CT (HRCT) scan and confirmed by perfusion scintigraphy.  14  Furthermore, automated software analysis (Yacta) of the CT scan data was performed, and the distribution of emphysema was visualized. 15 Patients with predominantly unilateral emphysema were excluded, whereas patients with both upper- or lower-lobe-predominant emphysema were included in the study.\nOther inclusion criteria were as previously documented for ELVR, with a FEV 1 , 40% predicted, residual volume (RV) . 150% predicted, and total lung capacity (TLC) . 100% predicted.  8,10,11 Exclusion criteria were walk distance of , 150 m in the 6-min walk test (6MWT) and hypercapnia with Pa co 2 . 55 mm Hg.\nPatients were recruited into two different study groups according to a stratified (with regard to upper and lower lobe predominance) randomization list with a distribution of 1:1 (  Fig 1  ).

This improvement was still present after 90 days. Improvement in RV was only signifi  cant after 90 days, but the RV/TLC ratio had already decreased significantly in this group after 30 days. TLC showed no significant change in either group during the follow-up period. In the bilateral treatment group none of the other pulmonary function parameters changed (  Tables 2, 3  ).\nImprovement in exercise capacity demonstrated in the 6MWD was only observed in the unilateral group after 30 and 90 days.

After 90 days, complete or partial atelectasis was visible on HRCT scan in five patients with complete closure and one patient of the bilateral group (  Fig 2  ). Visual volume reduction on HRCT scan after  90  days  was  present  in  nine  patients  of  the unilateral group and three of the other group. Radiologic evidence of atelectasis and volume reduction is, hence, signifi  cantly more common in the unilateral treatment group ( P 5 .004 and P 5 .030).\nComplications observed were four exacerbations, two per group, requiring antibiotic treatment and/or steroids without the need for hospitalization. In the bilateral group, two additional patients developed respiratory failure 52 and 76 days post ELVR. One patient required noninvasive ventilation; the other patient necessitated intubation at a different hospital and was transferred back to us for successful weaning. Both patients had their IBVs removed without difficulty  after  90  days  because  of  lack  of  clinical improvement.\nimprovement 90 days after ELVR. In this group, the 6MWD deteriorated continuously over the follow-up period and eight of the 11 patients were unable to achieve their baseline results.\nQoL  recorded  in  the  SGRQ  was  signifi  cantly improved in the unilateral group after 30 and 90 days. Improvements were more pronounced within the domains of symptoms and impacts rather than in the activity score, but the significant improvement of the total score appears to be due to improvement in the impact domain. Overall, in nine of 11 patients in the unilateral group, an improvement of .2 8 points was observed after 90 days. Furthermore, these patients improved by .2 1 point in mMRC score after 30 and 90 days. The improvement was significant after 90 days but not after the fi  rst 30 days. In the bilateral and incomplete treatment group, no significant improvement in either SGRQ or mMRC score was observed at any point during follow-up.\nThirty days after ELVR, atelectasis was found on chest  radiograph in  seven  of  the  11  patients  in  the\nthrough CT scan volumetric measurements that moderate volume reduction of the treated upper lobe can occur with following increase in volume of the untreated lobe of about 300 mL. This change in volume correlates with health-related QoL in the SGRQ but  has  not  been  translated  into  improvements  in PFT or 6MWD.  20\nIt appears that a clinically relevant improvement in outcome correlates with maximal possible volume reduction,  but  the  two  approaches  we  used  have never been compared directly, to our knowledge. Our study confi  rms that complete occlusion is a prerequisite for the development of atelectasis or visual volume reduction. Comparison of both treatment groups  shows  a  significantly  better  outcome  for patients with complete closure of one lobe as opposed to bilateral incomplete closure (  Table 4  ). Lung function  , exercise capacity, and QoL improved in almost all parameters by 30 days, and improvements were sustained  at  90  days  compared  with  incomplete occlusion (  Fig 3  ). Only the activity score and TLC showed no signifi  cant difference between both groups after 90 days. The reduction in RV and RV/TLC ratio as a parameter for hyperinflation is better demonstrated in the change in IVC rather than in the change in TLC.\nFor the patient, an improvement in exercise capacity,  QoL, and, fi  nally, survival are important. The minimal  clinically  important  difference  (MCID) defi  ned by Redelmeier et al 21 is 54 m, but this goal seems to be too high in daily practice, especially for patients  with  severe  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 21,22   For  these  patients, Puhan et al 23  suggest an improvement in 6MWD of 26 ± 2 m as the threshold for clinical relevance. The\nOne patient developed a pneumothorax at day 4 following ELVR with complete closure of his left upper lobe, which required insertion of a chest drain. It was removed after 12 days and the patient was discharged home 16 days after the procedure. He showed significant improvement after 90 days ( △ FEV 1 , 1 15.4%; △ 6MWD, 1 29.6%). No other complications were observed in either group; there was no migration of valves and no mortality.",

      "content": "The  aim  of  unilateral  valve  treatment  with  complete closure of all segments of one lobe is a real volume reduction of the most hyperinflated lobe. The maximum volume effect is achieved by developing a complete lobar atelectasis.  In  the  largest  published trial on ELVR (Endobronchial Valve for Emphysema Palliation Trial [VENT]) there was an increase of 4.3% in FEV 1 after 6 months in the treatment group, which was significant, but this mean change of 34.5 mL may not be clinically important for the individual patient. 8 However, in patients who had radiologic evidence of an intact fi  ssure as a marker for lack of collateral ventilation, a signifi  cantly larger volume reduction of . 700 mL was found. This ultimately led to a greater improvement in PFT and exercise capacity in this subgroup.\nThe aim during bilateral treatment with incomplete closure is a redistribution of ventilation toward the nontreated parts of the lung. It is postulated that clinical  improvement can be achieved through a reduction of dynamic hyperventilation even without causing atelectasis. 10  Coxson et al 20  were able to show\nFor between-group median differences, values were calculated with the use of a Hodges-Lehmann estimator with nonparametric 95% CIs; Wilcoxon signed-rank test  ; Values in bold are statistically significant ( P , .05). See Table 1 legend for expansion of abbreviations.\nand BODE index improve. Hence, it appears that mortality may be reduced with this minimally invasive therapy in patients with stage Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) III/IV and severe emphysema, but it appears unlikely after bilateral treatment because of lack of improvement in lung function and exercise capacity and absence of atelectasis formation.\nEven though we did not use HRCT scan analysis of fissures,  the  results  in  the  unilateral  group  are  well above the values from VENT.  8 It can be assumed that the reason for this is the improvement in patient and target  selection  and  more  procedural. 8,25,26   In  comparison with the VENT cohort, patients in this study had similarly  severe  airway  obstruction  but  more hyperinflation (mean FEV 1 , 29% ± 4% vs 30% ± 8% predicted;  mean  RV,  269% ± 47%  vs  216% ± 44% predicted). The HRCT scans of all patients were further analyzed with specific software. 15 By visualizing the most destroyed areas, the distribution and heterogeneity of emphysema can be better evaluated\nunilateral group with complete closure surpassed this  MCID at nearly 50 m after 30 and 90 days, whereas the bilateral group with partial treatment showed a reduction in walk distance.\nThe threshold for clinical relevance of the SGRQ is 2 4 points. 17 At an improvement of 2 12 points, as achieved in the unilateral group, a placebo effect can be excluded and an actual improvement in QoL can be assumed. Furthermore, the unilateral group achieved an improvement in mMRC of . 1  point, which is the defined MCID for this test, after 30 and 90  days.  An  improvement  in  QoL  after  bilateral incomplete treatment, which was shown in previous trials, was not confi  rmed in this study.\nHopkinson et al 24 examined the survival of 19 patients after ELVR with valves. Patients who had not developed an atelectasis died according to their ADO index, but all patients with a postinterventional atelectasis were still alive after 6 years. In our study, we were able to show that after unilateral valve placement the ADO\nthan by specifi  c scores. We further used perfusion scintigraphy for planning of therapy and in the unilateral group treated the lung with lower perfusion. However, future studies should estimate the presence of collateral ventilation based on CT scan analysis and/or bronchoscopic measurements to predict the likelihood of volume reduction and improve the outcome of treated patients. 27\nIn  unilateral  complete  closure  of  one  lobe,  an increased  incidence  of  pneumothoraces  is  to  be expected, especially after treatment of the left upper lobe with closure of the lingula. 11  Overall, the risk of pneumothorax associated with the procedure appears to  be  acceptable,  and  most  patients  would  likely accept the risk in view of the procedure itself having the  potential  to  signifi  cantly  improve  their  exercise capacity and QoL. In bilateral ELVR, on the other hand, there is a risk of respiratory failure that is explained by the near complete blocking of two lobes and lack of improvement of respiratory mechanics.\nThe limitations of this study are its short follow-up period as well as the low patient number, and the performance of procedures in a single center, as is common in pilot studies. Another potential limitation is the fact the average Pa co 2 was slightly higher in patients with bilateral incomplete treatment, but it is unlikely that this infl  uenced study outcome, as other indicators of disease severity did not show a difference. The results should be verified in a multicenter, prospective study with a larger number of patients with unilateral and complete closure treatment.",
