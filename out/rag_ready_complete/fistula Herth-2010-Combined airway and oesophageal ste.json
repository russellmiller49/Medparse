AEF may also occur secondary to radiation or chemotherapy, resulting in tumour dehiscence. This leads to frequent aspiration, with contamination of the airways and poor nutrition. Mortality is a common complication and the mean survival time ranges 1-6 weeks with supportive management alone [1]. Patients with underlying thoracic tumours presenting with symptoms of recent onset of coughing after feeding should raise a high index of suspicion for AEF. A diagnosis is often made using radiological tools, such as barium/gastrograffin oesophagography or computed tomography. Bronchoscopy and oesophagogastroduoedenoscopy (EGD) will help in localising\nthe fistula, and assessing the extent of tumour infiltration and the size of the defect.\nTreatments of these fistulas are difficult, considering that most of these patients have an inoperable tumour at the time of diagnosis. Therefore, supportive and palliative treatment forms the basis of improving the quality of life (QoL). Direct surgical fistula closure, bypass or fistula resection do not yield good results, and endoscopic stenting or endoprosthesis are palliative options in this situation [1]. Stents can be placed bronchoscopically in the airways, via EGD in the oesophagus or both in the airways and oesophagus to seal the defect and restore the patency of the passages with resumption of oral feeds [2-5].\nPlasticand silicone-cuffed stents were initially used in the management of AEF [6, 7]. With the use of self-expandable metallic stents (SEMS), there is an increase in the QoL in patients with\nAFFILIATIONS\n*Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Thoraxklinik, University of Heidelberg, Heidleberg, Germany.

A recent study reported improvement of symptoms in 90% of patients with AEF treated by insertion of oesophageal SEMS [11]. The success rate for closure of AEF using endoscopic methods varies from 87% to 91% [11-13].\nData are sparse regarding the benefits of airway or oesophageal stent insertion in the management of malignant AEF. In the endoscopic management of AEF, whether single stent placement in either of the passages is better than double stent placement is not clear. This prospective study was performed to assess the role of self-expandable nitinol airway and/or oesophageal stents in AEF, evaluate the pre- and post-stent insertion QoL, and examine the role of treatment and location of AEF as factors influencing survival in AEF patients managed with airway and/or oesophageal stent insertion.",

All patients had advanced lung or oesophageal cancer. Based on the symptom profile or site of the primary cancer, patients were treated with bronchoscopic stent insertion in the airways or endoscopic stent insertion in the oesophagus. The decision regarding stent placement was based on the location of the stenosis. If airway stenosis was present, then airway stents were inserted first and, in case of oesophageal stenosis, an oesophageal stent was inserted first. If the fistula was not closed, with the first stent, another stent was implanted directly in the other system. If the fistula was not satisfactorily closed as noted by dye injection with the first stent deployment, then a second stent was inserted immediately in the other system (airway plus oesophageal stent insertion). All procedures were performed under general anaesthesia using flexible video bronchoscopy, rigid bronchoscopy or EGD (Olympus Medical, Tokyo, Japan). Airway and/ or oesophageal Ultraflex nitinol stents (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) were used for all patients. The dimensions of the stent were chosen based on the site and size of the AEF, and the length of the lesion. Fluoroscopy was routinely used for the placement of oesophageal stents, while airway stents were placed under direct endoscopic visualisation. Informed consent was obtained from all patients and the study was approved by the local ethics committee (University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany).",

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "content": "Malignant AEF poses as a serious complication in patients with advanced neoplasia involving the oesophagus or the lung. The American College of Chest Physicians guidelines for palliative care in patients with a malignant AEF or broncho-oesophageal fistula recommends stent insertion in both the tracheobronchial tree and the oesophagus for symptomatic relief [16]. However, there is paucity of evidence and the net benefit is moderate in terms of morbidity and mortality in the endoscopic palliative management of malignant AEF. The findings of our study show that endoscopic stenting in AEF improves the overall QoL post-stent insertion and, thereby, has a significant role in the management of malignant AEF.\nThe goal of stent placement in AEF is to provide a seal between the airway and the oesophagus, thereby permitting enteral feeding and reducing bronchial contamination [17, 18]. Potential complications of stent placement in the oesophagus include perforation when placed in the cervical regions of the oesophagus, respiratory compromise due to compression of major airways and stent migration. Covered SEMS have, nevertheless, an advantage over plastic or silicon stents not only in covering large defects, but also in having lower rates of migration along with adequate maintenance of patency of the passages [3, 19, 20]. We observed a primary success of fistula closure in all patients who underwent stenting either in the airway, oesophagus or both systems. 24 patients developed a recurrence of fistula after a period of 6 weeks due to progressive disease. Appropriate\ndeployment of a second stent improved the overall success rate and survival in these patients. No major technical difficulties were experienced, supporting the hypothesis that airway and/or oesophageal stent insertion have an important role in the palliation of malignant AEF. Earlier studies have proposed combined airway and oesophageal stenting for malignant AEF [21-23]. The current study was not designed to examine the benefits of combined oesophageal and airway stenting compared to airway or oesophageal stenting in patients with malignant AEF.\nThe overall mean survival time for the patients in the current study was 236.6 days. The survival times were higher for the patients receiving oesophageal or combined oesophageal and airway stents than patients who received only airway stents. The reason why the airway group performed worse than the other groups is not clear (fig. 2), but it is possible that the airway group had more advanced disease; moreover, patients with stents placed distally (right main bronchus; fig. 1) performed worse compared to those whose stents were placed proximally in the airway (trachea). Among the distally placed airway stents, those stents placed in the right main bronchus had significantly poorer survival than those placed in the left main bronchus. Anatomically, the trachea and left main bronchus have more proximity to the oesophagus compared to the right main bronchus. Hence, an AEF at the level of the right main bronchus would reflect more severe disease, plausibly explaining the lower survival in this group. Similarly, mortality did not seem to be influenced by stent placement, as none of the patients died of stent-related complications. Patients who also received chemoand radiotherapy seem to have a prolonged survival compared to patients who did not receive these therapies.\nThe overall QoL scores improved significantly after placement of stents (fig. 3). The core QoL was considered appropriate in this study, considering the diverse study population consisting of both oesophageal and lung cancers. The improvement in QoL , 10 days post-stent insertion was quite evident in most of the patients. There was no significant difference between the groups, demonstrating that airway and/or oesophageal stent insertion was appropriate in improving the overall QoL. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is an alternative procedure that can be considered from a nutritional perspective\nc\nin patients with AEF [24]. To our knowledge, there are no clear guidelines for PEG placement in patients with AEF. The role of PEG was not examined in this study.\nIn conclusion, airway and/or oesophageal stent insertion provides an effective approach to improve QoL in patients with malignant AEF.",
