Common causes are primary and metastatic cancers, benign tumors, in /uniFB02 ammatory airway strictures, and foreign bodies (1). Symptoms include dyspnea, cough, wheeze, stridor, and hemoptysis. Some\npatients with distal (lobar or segmental) obstruction may not be symptomatic but are at risk for postobstructive complications such as pneumonia or pulmonary abscess and should be considered for endobronchial recanalization. Critical obstruction of the central airways is a medical emergency, and emergent\ntreatment is required in patients with severe respiratory distress.\nCryotherapy is one of several endoscopic modalities available for recanalization of obstructed airways. The technique is performed by deployment of a cryoprobe through the working channel of a /uniFB01 beroptic bronchoscope. The cryoprobe\nis cooled to 2 89 8 C by sudden expansion of an inert gas such as nitrous oxide in an insulated circuit according to the Joule -Thomson effect. Contact with the cold tip freezes the tissue and facilitates its removal (1 -3).\nMore recently, with improved cryoprobe resilience, cryodebridement (CD) techniques (also called cryosurgery ) have been developed to achieve immediate recanalization, reducing the need for repeat endoscopic procedures (1). However, experience with this technique has been limited (3 -7), and the aim of this study was to contribute to the knowledge of CD in this context.",

      "content": "After the study was approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Institutional Review Board (IRB 2013-P000161), we reviewed the electronic medical records of all patients who were treated with CD as the primary endoscopic method for relieving airway obstruction between December 2007 and March 2012 at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Both malignant and benign etiologies were included in this study. Patients who were treated with additional modalities such as mechanical debridement with forceps and/or electrosurgical techniques (argon plasma coagulation [APC] or electrocautery) as a complementary method were also included. Airway diameter estimated to be less than 50% was de /uniFB01 ned as a clinically signi /uniFB01 cant\nobstruction (2).\nThe narrowing was classi /uniFB01 ed as central when located in the trachea, main stem bronchi, or bronchus intermedius; distal when limited to the lobar and/or segmental bronchi; and diffuse when both central and distal airways were involved. Airway lesions were classi /uniFB01 ed as endobronchial, extrinsic, or mixed (2). The patient ' s location at the time of presentation was noted.\nAll procedures were performed in the operating room with the patient under total intravenous anesthesia (propofol, fentanyl, and paralytics). Patients were intubated with the aid of a rigid bronchoscope (Bryan-Dumon; Bryan Corporation, Woburn, MA), and jet ventilation was provided with a Monsoon III high-frequency ventilator (ACUTRONIC Medical Systems, Hirzel, Switzerland). A therapeutic /uniFB02 exible bronchoscope\n(OLYMPUS XT-160; Olympus America, Center Valley, PA) was introduced through the rigid barrel, and the airways were inspected down to subsegmental levels.\nAs per our protocol, the CD technique was used as the primary method for mechanical debridement of obstructive endobronchial lesions located in the trachea, main stem bronchi, bronchus intermedius, and lobar bronchi. For lesions located at the segmental and subsegmental levels, the /uniFB02 exible forceps was used as the main tool. The cryoprobe, owing to its size, adheres to normal mucosa when used in the small distal airways, causing bleeding upon extraction of the target lesion. In addition, for patients undergoing photodynamic therapy, CD was used to remove necrotic tumor debris 48 to 72 hours after activation.\nAfter the target lesion was identi /uniFB01 ed, the tip of the /uniFB02 exible bronchoscope was advanced within 1 cm proximal to the obstructive lesion. A 2.4-mm /uniFB02 exible cryoprobe (ERBOKRYO CA; ERBE Elektromedizin GmbH, T¨ ubingen, Germany) was introduced through the working channel of the /uniFB02 exible bronchoscope, and the tip was placed in direct contact with the obstructive tissue whenever possible by penetrating the substance of the target tissue to achieve maximal circumferential contact for freezing. Nitrous oxide delivered through the cryoprobe cooled the tip for 5 -15 seconds to 2 89 8 C. The freezing time used was dependent on the size of the lesion and the freezing effect visualized during the procedure. Next, the /uniFB02 exible bronchoscope, along with the cryoprobe and adherent frozen tissue, was withdrawn en bloc . The tip was then thawed in a warm-water bath at 37.5 8 C to facilitate separation of the tissue from the probe.\nThe use of a rigid bronchoscope facilitated multiple applications until complete or near-complete recanalization was achieved while providing adequate oxygenation, ventilation, and lung isolation (Figures 1A and 1B). Electrosurgical techniques such as electrocautery and APC were used for hemostasis after debridement. The use of the latter was limited to the central airways, owing to concern for air embolism as a potential complication. When mixed lesions were treated, cryorecanalization was often accompanied by balloon dilation and at times by stent placement.\nComplete restoration of airway patency was viewed as successful if no residual stenosis was visualized bronchoscopically. It was viewed as partially successful if residual stenosis was noted but the therapeutic /uniFB02 exible bronchoscope with an outer diameter of 6.2 mm could be passed through the obstruction and distal airways could be visualized. It was considered not successful if the therapeutic /uniFB02 exible bronchoscope could not traverse the stenotic segment (5). Chest computed tomographic (CT) scans were reviewed up to 8 weeks postintervention. The purpose of obtaining the imaging studies was to monitor progression or regression of the disease, verify stent position, and establish lung reexpansion. Radiologic improvement was de /uniFB01 ned by the treating physician (A.M. or E.F.) as increase in airway diameter and expansion of the lung.\nMajor complications were de /uniFB01 ned as respiratory failure leading to endotracheal intubation (ETI) or noninvasive ventilation (NIV), severe bleeding, pneumothorax, hemodynamic instability, airway perforation, and death during or within 30 days of the procedure. Complications\nwere considered clinically signi /uniFB01 cant if the patient ' s condition after CD warranted a step-up in the level of clinical care (i.e., hospitalization or intensive care unit admission). Bleeding was graded as mild if controlled by application of cold saline and/or epinephrine solution; moderate if controlled by APC or electrocautery; and severe if there was a need for transfusion of blood products, endobronchial blockade, bronchial artery embolization, or endotracheal intubation for suctioning of blood.",

      "content": "Between December 2007 and March 2012, 156 patients underwent CD with a /uniFB02 exible cryoprobe for relief of airway obstruction at our institution. The male-to-female ratio\nwas 1:1. The patients ' mean age was 63 years (range, 21 -88 yr). Most patients were symptomatic at presentation (n = 144 [92%]). Dyspnea, cough, and hemoptysis were the most common symptoms; these were noted in 87 (56%), 58 (37%), and 23 (26%) of patients, respectively. Most patients had multiple symptoms at presentation. Because of severe symptoms, 31 patients (20%) were initially admitted to the intensive care unit. Location of the obstruction was central in 63 patients (40%), distal in 44 patients (28%), and diffuse in 49 patients (33%). The lesions were endobronchial in 66 patients (42%) and mixed in 90 patients (58%) (Table 1).\nThe most frequent causes of malignant airway obstruction were non -small-cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma in 49 patients (31%) and 19 patients (12%), respectively (Table 2). The most common\ncause of benign airway obstruction was granulation tissue in 40 patients (26%) (Table 3). Of those with malignant obstruction, complete or partial airway patency was achieved in 38 (43%) and 45 (51%) of 88 patients, respectively, after the /uniFB01 rst procedure. For those with benign airway obstruction, complete or partial airway patency was accomplished in 56 (82%) and 9 (13%) of 68 patients, respectively.\nBecause of partial or no symptomatic response, a second bronchoscopy was performed within 4 weeks of the /uniFB01 rst procedure in 35 patients (22%), in 19 of whom it was done for malignant airway obstruction. Partial to complete patency was achieved in 32 (91%), and no improvement was achieved in 3 patients (8.5%); however, 2 of these latter patients had a third procedure within 4 weeks with\npartial to complete airway patency restored. Removal of foreign bodies, mucus plugs, and blood clots was successful in 100% of cases after the /uniFB01 rst bronchoscopy.\nThe median (SD) duration of the procedure was 63 6 35 minutes (range, 11 -225 min). Additional therapeutic procedures included mechanical debridement with forceps in 79 patients (51%), electrocautery in 47 patients (30%), and APC in 27 patients (17%). Forceps were used to complement endobronchial recanalization in the segmental and subsegmental airways, and APC and electrocautery were employed to achieve hemostasis and prevent airway obstruction due to clot formation. Balloon dilation was performed either preceding or following CD in 39 patients (25%) (Table 4). CD was the sole method of airway canalization in 42 patients (27%). The underlying etiology of airway obstruction was malignancy in 16 patients. Thirty/uniFB01 ve patients were symptomatic upon presentation. Partial to complete airway patency was achieved in 25 (96%) of 26 patients with benign airway obstruction and 16 of 16 patients with malignant airway obstruction. Symptom improvement was seen in 29 (83%) of 35 symptomatic patients.\nModerate bleeding in six patients was controlled with iced saline, APC, and\nelectrocautery. There were no cases of pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum. A partial mucosal tear in one patient did not require repair. Respiratory distress requiring ventilatory support with ETI was noted in seven patients, and NIV was used in two patients. All patients recovered. Of the seven patients who required ETI, three were extubated within 24 hours, two were extubated after 3 days, and one remained intubated for 9 days. No procedure-related deaths were reported (Table 5).\nFollowing CD, 89 (62%) of the 144 symptomatic patients showed substantial improvement, 29 (20%) experienced either some improvement or remained unchanged, and 18 (12%) worsened. Sixty/uniFB01 ve percent of patients who presented with dyspnea as their major symptom showed substantial improvement, and 71% of patients who presented mainly with hemoptysis improved. Radiologic improvement that manifested as evidence of lung expansion was noted at follow-up in 41 (59%) of the 70 patients who had CT scans of the chest within 8 weeks of CD.",

      "content": "Lung cancer and other metastatic solidorgan malignancies are the most common causes of symptomatic airway obstruction,\nbut benign disorders such as strictures, granulation tissue, and benign tumors are also encountered frequently. Thirty percent of patients with lung cancer have involvement of central airways with cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, and postobstructive pneumonia as potential sequelae (1, 2). Symptoms depend on the location, degree, and rapidity of occlusion and can be severe or life threatening, requiring immediate intervention to improve symptoms, oxygenation, and prevent complications (3 -5, 8).\nBronchoscopic techniques such as neodymium-doped yttrium-aluminumgarnet (Nd:YAG) laser, electrocautery, APC, and mechanical debridement are well established and frequently used to recanalize obstructed airways, often with a multimodality approach. Limitations of these techniques include cost (Nd:YAG laser), risk of airway perforation, and potential risk of airway /uniFB01 re when patients require FI O2 greater than 0.4. CD, on the other hand, is a bronchoscopic technique that is inexpensive, has minimal risk of airway perforation, and can be used in high FI O2 environments, allowing immediate relief of airway obstruction (1).\nThis study demonstrates that CD is an effective method for palliation of symptoms and airway recanalization and has a good safety pro /uniFB01 le when used alone or in combination with other endobronchial techniques. In 148 (95%) of our patients, airway patency was either complete or partial. This /uniFB01 nding was very similar for both malignant and benign etiologies. The success rate was comparable to that in a study by Schumann and coworkers (4) and higher than that in a previously reported 83% success rate (5). Improved patency rates compared with prior studies are likely due to increased experience of interventional bronchoscopists with this technique, as well as to the use of a multimodality approach (4). Although CD can be performed using /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopy with the patient under moderate sedation, in our experience the use of rigid intubation improves the safety of the procedure (1) by providing a secure airway and ventilation while allowing more aggressive debridement and additional interventions such as stent placement (8).\nInterestingly, although we were able to achieve partial to complete airway patency\nin 95% of the cases, only 88% of patients experienced symptomatic improvement. We speculate that this discrepancy may be due to patients ' underlying comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pneumonia, and in some cases to the effect of concurrent treatments (radiation and chemotherapy), that may transiently in /uniFB02 uence how patients feel about their overall well-being. Furthermore, a proportion of patients were asymptomatic, and the intervention was performed to prevent future postobstructive complications due to critical airway stenosis.\nLikewise, bronchoscopic airway patency did not always translate to immediate radiologic improvement (3). In our practice, we obtain a CT scan of the chest before intervention to assess the extent of the disease and at follow-up to monitor airway patency and evolution of the disease process. In our experience, radiologic improvement was most notable 2 weeks post-procedure and usually lagged behind improvement in symptoms (3). A possible explanation could be that obstruction typically leads to atelectasis and consolidation of lung parenchyma, therefore requiring time for aeration and reexpansion.\nThe location, etiology, and type of the lesion are important factors that in /uniFB02 uence the success of the procedure (2, 7), with higher success rates achieved in central airway obstructions than with more distal ones (2, 4, 7). We believe these /uniFB01 ndings are most likely related to the preserved integrity of the airway wall and the larger diameter found in the central airways, which allow better patency rates. In addition, patency is\noften dif /uniFB01 cult to achieve in diffuse disease, particularly when distal airways are involved, and cases should be assessed carefully with CT reconstructions and bronchoscopy to determine the appropriateness of the intervention. In our experience, cryoextraction of benign lesions such as benign airway tumors and granulation tissue produces excellent results (6), as the obstruction is typically entirely intrinsic to the airway. In addition, we report 100% success rates in cryoextraction of blood clots, mucus plugs, and foreign bodies, similar to previous reports (1, 6). Furthermore, with the use of balloon dilation and stent placement, higher patency rates are also achieved with mixed lesions (9).\nRegarding complication rates, CD has an excellent safety pro /uniFB01 le when used to treat both malignant and benign causes of airway obstruction (1, 4, 6). Bleeding risk is low because freezing of vascularized tissue causes microthrombosis, thus promoting a degree of hemostasis (1, 5, 10 -12). Airway damage is rarely reported with this technique, owing to the cryoresistant nature of avascular cartilage and /uniFB01 brous tissue (1, 10, 11). We report only one patient who sustained a partial mucosal tear that healed spontaneously with no evidence of concurrent pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum.\nIn addition, our rate of signi /uniFB01 cant bleeding was lower than previously reported, likely due to the concomitant use of electrocautery, APC, and laser (rare) to devitalize highly vascularized tumors such as renal cell carcinoma (12 -14). Respiratory failure was seen in 10 patients in this review. This result could be confounded by the fact that the majority\nof our patients had signi /uniFB01 cant disease burden and limited lung reserve, putting them at high risk for respiratory compromise after airway manipulation, regardless of the bronchoscopic technique used.\nCD can cause airway edema and bronchospasm (1), further increasing the risk of respiratory compromise. Some experts advocate the use of systemic corticosteroids for 24 hours postprocedure, although the bene /uniFB01 ts of this approach have not yet been proven (1). Finally, in an era when increasing volume of tissue is required for an array of diagnostic tests, including molecular genetic analyses, cryoextraction allows removal of large pieces while preserving the tissue architecture.\nOur study has some limitations that are important to discuss. First, airway narrowing was visually estimated at the time of bronchoscopy, which may have led to over- or underestimation of the obstruction. Although it is preferable to calculate the cross-sectional area of the airway lumen, this requires sophisticated software not currently available in our procedural suite. Second, the typical multimodality nature of real-life interventional bronchoscopy makes it dif /uniFB01 cult in a retrospective analysis to con /uniFB01 dently attribute treatment success or complications to a particular technique employed in the course of a procedure. We tried to overcome this limitation by performing a subgroup analysis of cases where CD was either the only or the primary modality used. In the latter, CD was found to be successful in achieving partial to complete airway patency in 41 (98%) of 42 cases. However, caution should be observed when interpreting these results, given the small number of available cases (42 [27%] of 156 cases) and the retrospective design of our study. As such, there remains a need for a larger, prospective randomized trial comparing the ef /uniFB01 cacy and safety of CD with alternative mechanical or thermal ablation modalities.\nIn conclusion, CD is an effective, safe, and inexpensive bronchoscopic tool to achieve immediate airway patency in patients with benign and malignant airway obstruction when performed by experienced operators (11, 15 -17). It can be used alone or in combination with various other techniques and can be used effectively either with /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopy and conscious sedation or, as in our setting,\nwith general anesthesia and rigid intubation (8, 15, 18). The cost of setting up cryosurgery, not including the bronchoscope, can be less than $15,000, compared with $200,000 for an Nd:YAG laser (12, 19), making it an appealing additional tool for most interventional bronchoscopy and thoracic surgical units.\nThis review of bronchial cryosurgery is one of the largest series published in the English literature; however, the results should be evaluated with caution due to the study ' s retrospective design re /uniFB02 ecting a single center ' s experience. As such, there remains a need for a prospective, randomized, multicenter\nstudy to compare safety, ef /uniFB01 cacy, and health economic outcomes for the different bronchoscopic interventional modalities commonly used in these settings. n\nAuthor disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org.",
