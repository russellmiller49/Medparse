      "content": "Robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (RAB) was FDA approved in 2018 and has rapidly gained widespread  adoption  as  an  important  tool  for  bronchoscopic sampling of pulmonary nodules. 1 Several  advantages  have  led  to  the  adoption  of robotic bronchoscopy in the United States. These include the stability of the system, the ability of the  catheter  to  remain  in  position  without  the need of human hands, and the improved navigation platform. 2\nAt our institution, we use the Ion™ endoluminal RB  platform (Intuitive Surgical © , Sunnyvale, USA). The Ion RB (IRB) platform uses a shapesensing technology to allow bronchoscopic navigation of a 3.5-mm OD  catheter with an endoluminal vision probe into the lung periphery while maintaining catheter stability and shape to maximize precision  in  sampling. 3   After  reaching the  target,  the  vision  probe  is  removed  to  allow biopsy  tools  to  be  utilized.  The  IRB  platform incorporates a thin slice CT prior to the procedure\nthat creates a 3D airway tree with anatomical borders and provides a pathway to pulmonary nodules or masses for sampling purposes. 1,2,4-8 Combining the system with fluoroscopy and radial endobronchial ultrasound (r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)) improves the diagnostic yield even further.\nSeveral published protocols have strongly recommended the use of general anesthesia and endotracheal intubation using large size (8.0-9.0) endotracheal tubes. These protocols also recommend the delivery of 6-8  mL/kg ideal body weight of  tidal  volume  and  a  positive  end-expiratory pressure  of  5-10  cm  H 2 O. 9   The  use  of  general anesthesia  along  with  bigger  endotracheal  tube (ETT) and tidal volumes is thought to  provide stable  anatomic  orientation  after  registration  by minimizing  CT-to-body  divergence.  Furthermore, it allows access for a therapeutic bronchoscope to clear pre-existing secretions and to prevent potential intra-procedural atelectasis, which may interfere  with  the  r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)  signal  leading  to  lower diagnostic yield. 9",

A 6.5 cuffed ETT was placed into  the  right  nostril  under  fiberoptic  guidance [Figure 1(b)]. The IRB platform was then docked to the ETT.

Transbronchial\nforceps biopsy with a 1.7-mm forceps, transbronchial brush, and bronchoalveolar lavage were also obtained  under  fluoroscopic  guidance.  Rapid onsite evaluation showed scant degenerated cells. Final pathology showed  necrotic debris and chronic  inflammation,  but  no  malignant  cells. Cultures were negative.

      "title": "Discussion",
      "content": "The diagnosis of peripheral lesions is challenging, and no single tool or technology has been associated with 100% diagnostic yield. Robotic bronchoscopy  has  shown  a  navigation  success  of 88.6%, with a 70-77% diagnostic yield, and has been  rapidly  adopted  across  the  United  States. The  demand  for  peripheral  bronchoscopy  and RAB has increased with the higher incidence of pulmonary nodules seen with the wide adoption of lung cancer screening. 10,11\nCase 1 featured significant  airway  access  limitation  in  a  patient  with  trismus  and  a  challenging LUL nodule location, which made the option for CT-guided  biopsy  unrealistic.  Published  guidelines  advocate  for  larger  artificial  airways  during RAB  to  facilitate  initial  airway  clearance  with\ntherapeutic  bronchoscopes  prior  to  docking  the robot. 4,6   In  this  particular  case,  oral  intubation with  a  large  artificial  airway  was  not  possible. Although not optimal, initial airway clearance was performed using a small bronchoscope through a 6.5  ETT  prior  to  performing  RAB.  The  ETT adapter was connected to the 6.5 cuffed ETT, and RAB was performed without interruption. We are not aware of any other reported cases in the literature  describing  the  use  of  robotic  bronchoscopy through a small nasal airway. This case highlights a deviation from recommended protocols suggesting larger oral ETT in patients undergoing RAB. This illustrated approach of using a smaller ETT, via oral or nasal routes, could be useful in patients with history of head and neck cancers, limited jaw movement, and in patients with a known history of tracheal stenosis.\nCase 2 highlights the reach of RAB beyond the airway walls when the catheter is parked in close proximity to the target. We have experienced this type of reach in intraparenchymal lesions without a bronchus sign, and sometimes without a\nR-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) signal, by extending a needle through an airway wall into a lesion in close proximity to the tip of the Ion catheter. Multiple reports have documented the advantage of RAB in nodules with no  bronchus  sign,  with  similar  diagnostic  yield when compared to lesions with bronchus sign. 3,12 In this case, we chose lymph node station 5 as a target during the planning phase considering its proximity  to  a  branch  of  the  LUL  bronchus. Since  rapid  on-site  cytology  was  negative  from the LUL nodule, we drove the IRB catheter and parked it 7  mm away from lymph node station 5. We then extended a 21-gauge needle under fluoroscopic guidance and obtained a sample, which came back consistent with small cell carcinoma. The final pathology from LUL nodule was nondiagnostic. This approach has definitely allowed us  to  avoid  further  invasive  procedures  such  as Video-Assisted  Thoracoscopic  Surgery  (VATS) biopsy and mediastinoscopy.\nCase 3 shows the utility of RAB in recurrent lung cancer at a previous stump site. The new lesion was certainly challenging to access with\nconventional  bronchoscopy  (lesion  behind  the stump) or CT-guided biopsy considering its central  location.  In  addition,  the  patient  was  not  a good  surgical  candidate.  When  we  considered attempting  to  biopsy  this  lesion  with  RAB,  we were  concerned  about  applying  excessive  pressure with the catheter against the airway stump. The drive force signal feature was helpful in alleviating  these  concerns.  In  addition,  we  used  a diagnostic  bronchoscope  which  was  navigated through the airways on the side of the ETT. We wanted to document the position of the Ion catheter  tip  in  close  proximity  to  the  stump  while avoiding  excessive  pressure.  A  25-gauge  needle was used through the airway wall, and the lesion was sampled with positive rapid on-site cytology examination.",

The advanced  features  of  RAB  in  these  scenarios allowed for obtaining diagnostic samples in patients who otherwise would have required surgical  and  more  invasive  approaches.  RAB  was used  unconventionally  in  this  series  to  access through a nasal artificial airway, to sample mediastinal  lymph  node  stations  not  reachable  with convex Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscope, and to reach recurrent lung cancer hidden behind a previous airway stump. RAB systems provide advantageous catheter maneuverability  and  stability, and  these promising features should be explored further in clinical  situations  not  amenable  to  conventional bronchoscopy.",
