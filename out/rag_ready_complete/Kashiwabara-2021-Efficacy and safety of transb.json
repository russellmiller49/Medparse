      "content": "Malignant central airway obstruction (CAO) may occur not only in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)), but also in those with lung metastases from primary malignant tumors at other sites, and could become life-threatening,  potentially  causing  death  from  suffocation, if left untreated. A number of reports suggested that some transbronchial interventions (TBIs) can relieve\nrespiratory distress and improve the quality of life in patients with malignant CAO (Ernst et al. 2004; Ost et al. 2015b; Mudambi et al. 2017). Ablative therapies, photodynamic therapy and cryotherapy have been employed for patients with endoluminal obstruction, and stent placement has been undertaken in patients with extraluminal obstruction. Multiple modalities may be required in patients with mixed-type obstruction (Mudambi et al. 2017).\nLaser ablation, electrocautery and argon plasma coagulation are commonly used ablative procedures for the treatment of endoluminal obstruction and are performed under general anesthesia using either a flexible or rigid bronchoscope. During ablative therapies, continuous suction of smoke and fraction of inspired oxygen   (FiO 2 ) of  <  40% are recommended in order to minimize the risk of accidental\npenetrating injury and airway fire (Bolliger and Mathur 2002). Ablative therapies should be undertaken with great caution, in the operating room, for malignant CAO patients with respiratory failure who require high   FiO 2 values.\nMicrowave ablation is a thermal therapy that heats up the tissue by dielectric hysteresis. When an electrical magnetic field at a frequency of 2450 MHz is created around the monopolar antenna (electrode), polar molecules (mainly H2O) in the tissue are forced to continuously realign with the oscillating electric field, resulting in frictional heat. The tissue is coagulated by the frictional heat, but the tissue temperature rarely exceeds 100 ℃ (the boiling point of water) (Lubner et al. 2010). In addition, microwave ablation has low tissue penetrability and does not produce smoke in the airway, because the tissues are not carbonized by this procedure. The lower airway temperature decreases the risk of airway fire and the absence of smoke and relative low tissue penetrability decreases the risk of accidental penetrating injury, as compared to the case in other ablative therapies.\nWe speculate that in malignant CAO patients with respiratory failure, microwave ablation therapy might be safer and more effective than other ablative therapies. Although it has been reported that percutaneous microwave ablation therapy is useful for medically unresectable Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with a solitary nodule (Wolf et al. 2008), there are no reports of the safety and efficacy of transbronchial microwave ablation (TMA) therapy for patients with malignant CAO. Therefore, we conducted this retrospective study to evaluate whether TMA therapy might be a safe and effective treatment for malignant CAO patients with respiratory failure.",

      "content": "This retrospective, single-institution study was conducted with the approval of the Institutional Review Board of Kumamoto Regional Medical Center (approval date, October 2, 2020; approval number, 20-07). We retrieved the data of 60 patients of advanced Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or lung metastases with symptomatic malignant CAO registered in our medical records database during the period between October 1, 2013, and March 31, 2020. Four patients did not receive any TBI because of long-standing atelectasis of the whole lung on one side ( n =  2), massive hemoptysis occurring before any TBI could be undertaken ( n =  1), or patient refusal for TBIs ( n =  1). Of the remaining patients, 18 patients with extraluminal obstruction received metallic stent placement and 38 patients with endoluminal obstruction received TMA therapy (Fig. 1).\nDuring TMA therapy, minimal interruptions of the procedure are needed for periodic section of smoke or adjustment of the   FiO 2 to minimize the risk of accidental penetrating injury/airway fire (Lubner et al. 2010). TMA therapy was\nperformed under moderate sedation and high   FiO 2 values, because in patients with malignant CAO with life-threatening respiratory failure, this could save time for general anesthesia in the operating room. Before the TMA procedure was started, topical anesthesia of the oropharynx was established with 2% nebulized lidocaine. The patient lay supine on the fluoroscopic table and received supplemental oxygen via an oxygen mask (5-10 L/min), and the heart rate, electrocardiogram, and peripheral arterial oxygen saturation   (SpO 2 ) were monitored. Midazolam was administered by intravenous bolus injection at the starting dose of 3-4 mg, with additional doses of 1-2 mg administered as needed. If the patients could not lie supine because of severe dyspnea, 2% lidocaine solution for topical anesthesia of the oropharynx was administered via a bronchoscope after the patient had been moderately sedated with midazolam. A nasopharyngeal airway was temporarily placed.\nTMA was performed using a microwave tissue coagulator (Microtaze® OT-110 M or AFM-712, Alfresa Pharma Co., Osaka, Japan). A flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope was introduced through the nasopharyngeal airway into the trachea. A long-roller type microwave electrode (TE-24BL) was inserted via the bronchoscope. The tip of the electrode was pressed against the surface of the endoluminal tumor. The tumor was coagulated at 50 watts until the surface of the tumor became white, and the coagulated tissue was removed with biopsy forceps. Care was taken during the procedure to ensure that the electrode did not touch the surface of the normal bronchial mucosa. The TMA was considered successful if at least 50% airway patency of was restored.\nWe stratified the 38 patients with malignant CAO in this study who received TMA therapy into two groups according to whether the patients had respiratory failure or not at the time of TMA therapy (presence/absence of respiratory failure was defined by the ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial blood   (PaO 2 ) to   FiO 2 (PaO 2 /FiO 2 )), as follows: the group with respiratory failure (RF group: PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 300; n =  10) and the group without respiratory failure (non-RF group:   PaO 2 /FiO 2 >  300; n =  28) (Fig. 1). The endpoints of the study were the differences in the rate of successful restoration of the airway patency after the first session of TMA, the complication rate of TMA therapy, and the overall survival time (OS) between the RF group and the non-RF group. OS was defined as the period from the initiation of TMA therapy until patient death. Comorbidities at the time of TMA therapy were evaluated according to the Charlson comorbidity index (Charlson et al. 1987).\nStatistical analysis was performed using the Stat View J 5.0 statistical program (SAS, Institute Inc., Berkeley, CA, USA). Analyses of the clinical numerical data and categorical variables were performed using the Mann-Whitney U -test and Fisher's exact probability test, respectively. The log-rank test was performed to identify the clinical variables\npotentially associated with the OS. Variables identified as being significant with p values of < 0.10 were entered into the Cox proportional-hazards model for multivariate analysis. The hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were determined. OS was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Two-tailed p values of less than 0.05 were considered as being indicative of statistically significant differences.",

There was not a significant difference in the OS between the RF group and the non-RF group (7.1 months vs. 9.1 months, p =  0.059) (Fig. 2a). After the TMA therapy, 21 patients (55%) received best supportive care (BSC) alone and 17 patients (45%) received post-TMA anticancer therapy. Additional TBIs were performed, as appropriate, in nine patients who had received BSC alone.\nThe OS was longer in the patients who received post-TMA anticancer therapy than in the patients who received BSC alone (31.0 months vs. 3.5 months, p <  0.0001). Among patients who received BSC alone, there was no difference in the OS between the RF group and the non-RF group (3.1 months vs. 3.8 months, p =  0.721) (Fig. 2b).

Airway patency restoration after the first session of TMA and post-TMA anticancer therapy were identified as important prognostic factors in the malignant CAO patients.\nAirway patency restoration by TBIs can relieve the respiratory distress immediately in patients with malignant CAO. As it has been reported that TBIs have a greater impact and more useful in patients with more severe dyspnea at the baseline and that patients with more severe functional impairment are more likely to benefit from TBIs (Ost et al. 2015b), it is important to undertake TBIs as early as is safely possible, with a minimum waiting time, for patients with malignant CAO. In our study, airway patency was successfully restored within an hour of initiation of the first session of TMA in 95% of the patients, similar to the results reported previously for other TBIs (Stephens and Wood 2000).\nThe complication rate of TBIs is reported to be in the rage of 4-20% (Ost et al. 2015a; Chhajed et al. 2006; Han et  al.  2007;  Murgu  et  al.  2012;  Mahmood  et  al.  2015; Stratakos 2016; Shin et al. 2018; Verma et al. 2019), and urgent or repeat procedures, presence of severe systemic",

      "content": "comorbidities, and moderate sedation are reported associated with higher rates of complications (Ost et al. 2015a). In our study, 4 of the 38 patients (11%) developed complications after the TMA therapy; 2 patients developed endobronchial bleeding during TMA and 2 other patients developed airway re-occlusion within 24 h of the procedure by detachment of normal bronchial epithelium. Patients in whom the normal bronchial mucosa has been accidentally coagulated during TMA should be monitored carefully for at least 24 h for early detection of airway re-occlusion by detachment of normal bronchial epithelium.\nIn the studies listed in Table 4, all the patients with malignant CAO underwent TBIs under general anesthesia. According to the report by Murgu et al. (2012), the incidence of complications in Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with malignant CAO and respiratory failure undergoing TBIs, including debulking, laser therapy and stent placements under\ngeneral anesthesia, was 8%. As the complication rate in the RF group in our study, in which TMA was performed under moderate sedation, was 11%, we suggest that TMA therapy under moderate sedation and high   FiO 2 values is feasible in malignant CAO patients with respiratory failure.\nTBIs have been reported to prolong the  survival  in patients with malignant CAO, with a median OS time of 6.6-12.4 months (Table 4), and additional radiotherapy or chemotherapy after TBI has been reported to have a significant beneficial effect on the prognosis (Chhajed et al. 2006; Verma et al. 2018; Daneshvar et al. 2019). In the present study, the median OS from the initiation of TMA therapy was 7.1 months in the RF group and 9.1 months in the non-RF group, and the efficacy of TMA therapy was not inferior to that reported for other TBIs. In addition, among the patients who received post-TMA anticancer therapy, there was a significant difference in the OS between the RF\nCI confidence interval, Hazard ratio (HR) hazard ratio, PaO2 /FiO 2 the ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial blood to the inspired oxygen fraction, TMA transbronchial microwave ablation\nData are expressed in numbers or median values (range)\nACT anticancer therapy, DB debulking, GA general anesthesia, LC lung cancer, m median or mean, LS laser resection, MS moderate sedation, OS overall survival, RF respiratory failure, ST stent placement, TBI transbronchial intervention, TMA transbronchial microwave ablation\ngroup and the non-RF group (7.1 months vs. 32.8 months, p =  0.011). The percentage of patients with lung metastases Odds ratio (or) adenoid cystic carcinoma was higher in the non-RF group than in the RF group (43% vs. 0%, p =  0.035). This could be the reason why patients in the non-RF group had a better prognosis, as patients with lung metastases with no other malignant lesions in the lung, except CAO, show a better prognosis and adenoid cystic carcinoma is a welldifferentiated and slow growing tumor.\nOur study had certain limitations. Firstly, the sample size was small because this was a retrospective study conducted at a single institution. This is, however, the first report to suggest that TMA therapy could be safely undertaken for malignant CAO patients with respiratory failure. Secondly, there was a potential selection bias because patients in the non-RF group possibly had a better prognosis. As the purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate whether TMA therapy was safe and effective treatment in malignant CAO patients with respiratory failure, this bias would not have affected our results. Thirdly, we could not evaluate the change in the respiratory symptom, spirometric indices, severity of the complications of TMA therapy or the quality of life of the patients before and after TMA therapy in detail because TMA is performed as a palliative treatment in patients with life-threatening respiratory failure.\nIn conclusion, TMA therapy under moderate sedation and high   FiO 2 values was well-tolerated and effective in patients with malignant CAO, including those with respiratory failure.\nFunding No funding was received from any source for this work.",
