Development of an endobronchial ultrasound (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)) bronchoscope has enabled 'real-time' TBNA by confirming the position of the needle tip under Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) imaging during the TBNA procedure, allowing for a more highly accurate TBNA procedure than by the conventional TBNA. Although Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided TBNA (EBUSTBNA) is a relatively new procedure, many studies have reported its usefulness for hilar/mediastinal explorations [11-13] , and it has been rapidly popularized.

      "content": "Bronchoscopic procedures were performed under local anesthesia with lidocaine and conscious sedation with intravenous midazolam  by  staff  pulmonologists  or  supervised  pulmonary residents. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was performed in the same manner we previously described   [15, 16]  . After insertion of the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscope  (BF-UC260F-OL8; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) into  the trachea directly or through an endotracheal tube, a balloon attached on the transducer was inflated with saline solution. The balloon was then brought into contact with the airway wall and moved  in  all  directions  to  identify  the  lesions  for  sampling. When the target lesion was visualized by Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), a 21- or 22-gauge needle was passed through the working channel of the bronchoscope, which was then advanced through the tracheobronchial wall into the lesion under real-time Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) visualization. After stylet  removal,  suction  was  applied  using  a  syringe  while  manipulating the needle back and forth within the lesion. After the sampling, the suction was released slowly and the needle was retracted.\nThe specimen collected in the lumen of the needle was first pushed out with the central stylet and then blown by air with a syringe onto a glass slide. The visible tissue fragment on the glass slide was then collected and transferred into numbered separate containers filled with formalin for histologic examination. The remaining specimen on the glass slide was smeared with another glass slide, then the residual specimen stored at the lumen of the needle and catheter was then washed and flushed into saline for culture   [15-17]  . In patients assigned to the ROSE group, one glass  slide  was  used  for  ROSE  and  another  was  submitted  for permanent cytologic examination with Papanicolaou stain. For ROSE, a cytotechnologist evaluated the cell material of the airdried smears on-site with a quick staining method (Diff-Quik; Kokusaishiyaku, Kobe, Japan). Additional passes were made after the ROSE result was identified. The decision as to termination or additional samplings was made by the examiner based on  the  ROSE  results.  In  patients  assigned  to  the  non-ROSE group, all smeared cytologic specimens were fixed in 95% alcohol for cytologic examination. Three punctures were defined as a standard number in the study protocol, and additional punctures or additional bronchoscopic procedures such as Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for other lesions or transbronchial biopsy (TBB) for peripheral pulmonary lesions were performed if the examiner considered it necessary. The location of the lymph node examined   [18]  , the  number of punctures and the time of the procedure were recorded.\nDiagnosis\nEach histologic and cytologic specimen was interpreted separately  by  an  experienced  pathologist.  'Suspicious'  findings  were regarded as negative in our analysis. The final diagnoses were established by pathological evidence from biopsy (e.g. bronchoscopic, radiological or surgical procedures), microbiological analysis or clinical follow-up. Benign diagnoses for patients without a definitive diagnosis by Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA were confirmed by radiological size stability and clinical compatibility during the follow-up period for at least 6 months after bronchoscopy.",

      "content": "To our knowledge, this is the first randomized study on the effect of ROSE during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA in the diagnosis of lung cancer. This study demonstrated that during EBUSTBNA ROSE reduced the puncture number or obviated the need for additional bronchoscopic procedures, but it was not associated with the total bronchoscopy time. We could not demonstrate differences in diagnostic accuracy or complication rate in this small study. Our study showed the usefulness of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA as the initial diagnostic test for the pathological confirmation of lung cancer as well.\nROSE feeds back valuable information to the examiner on the adequacy of cytologic samples at the time of needle  aspiration  procedures,  which  indicates  whether the procedure should be repeated or not. In conventional\nTBNA, many investigators have reported the usefulness of ROSE, but the role is controversial   [8, 9]  . For example, several authors have reported that ROSE increases the diagnostic yield   [2, 3]  . The examiner can modify the technique by changing the puncture site, puncture depth or angle based on the ROSE results, which might increase the  diagnostic  yield.  The  results  of  recent  randomized studies contradicted the diagnostic efficacy of ROSE during conventional TBNA   [5, 7]  . In a randomized study including 168 patients, Trisolini et al.   [5] demonstrated no significant difference between TBNA with and without ROSE in terms of diagnostic yield or sample adequacy. In addition, procedure time on TBNA with ROSE was significantly longer than TBNA without ROSE due to processing, and careful review of the slides despite the use of ROSE was associated with fewer biopsy sites. The same investigators  noted  that  the  benefit  of  ROSE  during TBNA was avoidance of additional biopsy which was associated with complications. Yarmus et al.   [7] also found similar results in their randomized study of 68 patients.\nThe value of ROSE during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA may be smaller than that during conventional TBNA in terms of diagnostic yield because of the high diagnostic yields of EBUSTBNA regardless of using ROSE. In fact, it was reported that  7  aspirates  maximized  the  yield  of  conventional TBNA for the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer   [19]  , while a study   [20] concerning Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA demonstrated that 3 aspirates per lesion were sufficient to obtain optimal results for the staging of lung cancer. The result may suggest that the optimal yield is obtained by 3 aspirates regardless of using ROSE. Griffin et al.   [21] also found that ROSE during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA did not increase the diagnostic yield in their retrospective study. They also reported that ROSE during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA did not decrease the number of lesions sampled per patient. To the contrary, our study demonstrated that during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA ROSE reduced the puncture number per lesion  or  the number of lesions aspirated. In our clinical practice without ROSE, we prefer performing Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for plural lesions to performing Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for a single lesion to increase the diagnostic yield if there are multiple evaluable lesions   [16]  . If we use ROSE, we can judge the necessity  of  further  needle  passes  or  diagnostic  procedures from the ROSE results. In our study, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for multiple  lesions  was  performed  in  only  5%  of  patients with enlarged evaluable lesions other than the main target lesion in the ROSE group, against 75% of patients in the non-ROSE group. However, the clinical benefit might be limited. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA is extremely safe, so the additional punctures can be performed without additional compli-\nData are presented as %. a p = 0.95 using χ 2 test.\ncations. In addition, ROSE could not shorten the bronchoscopy time because preparing and reviewing slides for ROSE took time.\nOur study demonstrated the usefulness of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA as the initial diagnostic test for lung cancer as well. Diagnosis of lung cancer as well as its staging is one of the common indications for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA. We often encounter patients with a small peripheral primary lung cancer with  bulky  mediastinal  lesions.  In  addition,  some  lung cancers, especially small cell lung cancers, present mediastinal masses without a distinct primary parenchymal lesion   [22]  . Furthermore, the result of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA plays an important role not only for the diagnosis but also the mediastinal  staging.  Surgical  resection  is  not  the  treatment of choice for most patients with the positive result of N3 lymph nodes, N2 lymph nodes or N1 lymph nodes in small cell lung cancer. While many investigators have reported the accuracy of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for the staging of lung cancer   [11, 12]  , little has been reported on the role of the procedure in the diagnosis of lung cancer. Lee et al. [22] retrospectively evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for lung cancer. They reported excellent accuracy and sensitivity of 98 and 97%, respectively. Our study again demonstrated the high accuracy of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA in the diagnosis of lung cancer with or without ROSE. Despite the high accuracy, we must carefully interpret the pathological findings of epithelioid cell granulomas. In our study, sarcoidal reaction at the target lesion was found in one patient with lung cancer in each group. It may be difficult to distinguish between sarcoidosis and sarcoidal reaction from only pathological samples. If a specimen is obtained with a sarcoid-like  appearance  from  enlarged lymph node in patients with suspected lung cancer, another biopsy for the primary lesion should be performed.\nThe limitation of our study was that the primary endpoint was the frequency for eliminating the need for additional bronchoscopic procedures, but not the diagnos-\ntic  sensitivity  for  lung  cancer.  Therefore,  our  study  is clearly too small to compare the diagnostic yield of EBUSTBNA with and without ROSE. At the time of making our study protocol, we expected the difference between the diagnostic  accuracy  of  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA  with  and  without ROSE would be quite small, so the power calculation for demonstrating  diagnostic  superiority  of  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA with ROSE seemed to be unrealistic. In fact, one review article    [12]  ,  which  analyzed  1,299  patients  who  underwent Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for mediastinal staging of lung cancer, reported the pooled sensitivity of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA with or without ROSE to be 0.97 and 0.92. However, the statistically  significant  difference  could  not  be  demonstrated even in such a large population. To show the diagnostic superiority of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA with ROSE, thousands of patients in each arm would be required. In our study, although ROSE provided little clinical benefit in patients with high prevalence and probability, it might be useful in other populations. For staging purposes, the preprobability of metastasis may be lower, and thus more lymph nodes should be examined. In addition, the instantaneous results  of  ROSE  during  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA  in  the  staging  of lung cancer have been reported to be useful for the decision-making following surgical resection   [23]  . More detailed elucidation of the role of ROSE during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA in patients with lung cancer for staging purposes may be warranted in a further study.\nIn conclusion, ROSE during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA in the initial  diagnosis  of  lung  cancer  can  reduce  the  puncture number or eliminate the need for additional bronchoscopic procedures.",
