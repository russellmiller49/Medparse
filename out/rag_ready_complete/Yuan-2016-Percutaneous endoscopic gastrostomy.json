Problems at  any  point  between  the  mouth  and  the  stomach  can  lead  to a  disturbance  in  swallowing,  which  can  impede  the  transport  of liquids  or  solids,  or  both,  down  the  gastrointestinal  tract.  Many conditions can give rise to a disturbance in swallowing: mechanical obstruction  (e.g.  oesophageal  cancer,  peptic  stricture,  Zenker's diverticulum, extrinsic compression) and neurological or muscular disorders  (e.g.  stroke,  achalasia,  multiple  sclerosis,  Parkinson's disease and infections such as syphilis). Swallowing disturbances affect  up  to  half  of  individuals  who  have  experienced  a  stroke, leading  to  potentially  fatal  complications  such  as  malnutrition and  aspiration  of  the  digestive  juice  (Singh  2006;  Walter  2007). Nutritional  support  is  very  important  for  individuals  who  have swallowing disturbances.",

      "title": "Description of the intervention",
      "content": "There  are  two  main  ways  to  administer  nutritional  substances to individuals with swallowing difficulties: via a nasogastric tube or  via  gastrostomy,  a  surgical  procedure  for  placing  a  tube  into the  stomach through the abdominal wall. Gastrostomy is widely used for providing enteral nutrition in individuals with swallowing disturbances  or  for  palliating  the  drainage  of  gastric  juice  and secretions. It can be performed by open surgery or percutaneously. Percutaneous  techniques  are  more  frequently  used  than  open surgery so as to avoid the risks associated with general anaesthesia and  laparotomy  (Galletti  2001).  Percutaneous  gastrostomy  can be  achieved  via  interventional  radiology  or  endoscopy.  The  first percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), using a flexible and illuminated  instrument  passed  orally  into  the  stomach  to  assist with  the  placement  of  the  nutritional  tube  into  the  stomach through  the  skin,  was  successfully  performed  by  Gauderer  and Ponsky in 1979 (Gauderer 1980), which is widely called \"pull-type\" gastrostomy. The \"push-type\" endoscopic gastrostomy differs from the  \"pull-type\"  in  that  the  gastrostomy  tube  is  pushed  over  the guide-wire  from  the  mouth  to  stomach  other  than  being  pulled through the alimentary tract (Sacks 1983). Another modification of endoscopic gastrostomy is the \"introducer\" method, in which the gastrostomy tube is inserted directly through a peel-away sheath into  the  stomach  under  endoscopic  guidance  (Moran  1990).  In 1981, Preshaw introduced percutaneous radiological gastrostomy (PRG) (sometimes also named radiologically inserted gastrostomy or RIG), which enables the successfully placement of the nutritional tube by means of sonographic or fluoroscopic guidance rather than via endoscopy or open surgery (Preshaw 1981).\nNowadays, percutaneous gastrostomy approaches have replaced surgical gastrostomy for reasons of simplicity, safety and effectiveness. As a general rule, gastrostomy should be considered for  individuals  whose  nutritional  intake  will  be  insufficient  for more than two to three weeks (Loser 2005). It can also be used for  decompression  of  the  stomach  and  small  bowel  (Herman 1992).  Some  conditions  are  deemed  to  be  contraindications  to percutaneous  gastrostomy,  such  as  severe  ascites,  peritonitis, serious  coagulation  disorders,  interposed  liver  or  colon,  severe carcinomatosis of the peritoneum, serious psychosis and a short life expectancy (ASGE 1998; Greff 1999).\nSome individuals who have undergone PEG or PRG  may develop complications. Haemorrhage requiring blood transfusion or  laparotomy,  peritonitis,  fistulas  between  the  stomach  and adjacent viscera, bowel perforation, aspiration of material in the airways,  heart  failure,  respiratory  failure,  heart  and  respiratory failure, sepsis, necrotising fasciitis, metastatic tumour implantation into the stoma and loss of catheter tract are considered major  complications  that  are  life-threatening  and  may  require aggressive intervention. Categorised as minor complications requiring minimal intervention are abdominal pain with or without peritoneal involvement, wound infection, fever, peristomal leaks, wound  granulation  or  bleeding,  gastroparesis,  regurgitation  or reflux, and minor gastric tube problems (Galaski 2009). In a metaanalysis, PRG has been shown to be associated with lower rates of major complications than PEG (5.9% versus 9.4%, respectively), but  higher  rates  of  minor  complications  (7.8%  versus  5.9%, respectively) (Wollman 1995).",

      "title": "How the intervention might work",
      "content": "For individuals with swallowing disturbances, percutaneous gastrostomy is a well-established technique for providing enteral nutrition support. Both PEG (by pull-type or push-type tubes) and PRG are options for the percutaneous placement of a nutritional tube.  A  meta-analysis  has  reported  the  rate  of  successful  tube placement to be 99.2% with PRG and 95.7% with PEG (Wollman 1995). Likewise, in a recent study of PRG, the reported success rate was 100%, even in a series of individuals in many of whom PEG had either failed or was not considered an option (Dinkel 2002). Both approaches have clear clinical value in individuals with swallowing disturbances:  both  can  provide  the  essential  nutritional  support required  without  the  discomfort  that  many  individuals  with  no appetite  report  when  taking  oral  nutritional  supplements  (Loser 2005). Some studies have also demonstrated that acceptance and tolerance of enteral nutrition,  and  the  consequent  improvement in  malnutrition  and  quality  of  life,  in  individuals  who  have undergone  percutaneous  gastrostomy  via  either  technique  are excellent (Bannerman 2000; Loser 1998; Loser 2003; Senft 1993).",

      "title": "Why it is important to do this review",
      "content": "There are many studies reporting the efficacy and safety of PEG and PRG. However, the optimal technique for gastrostomy in individuals with swallowing disturbances remains unknown. It seems that PEG is  used  more  widely  than  PRG  for  long-term  enteral  nutritional support, and some authors consider PEG to be the superior method for  nutritional  support  (Galletti  2001;  Grant  2009;  Rustom  2006). In  contrast,  because  of  a  higher  success  rate  and  lower  risk  of aspiration, PRG is preferred over PEG by other authors (Chio 2004; Desport 2005; Thornton 2002).\nA meta-analysis of published literature (involving 5680 participants)  conducted  by  Wollman  1995  found  that  PRG  was associated  with  a  higher  success  rate  and  less  morbidity  than PEG.  In  contrast,  another  meta-analysis  focusing  on  individuals with  neck  and  head  cancer  (2353  participants)  found  PRG  to  be associated with a higher number of major complications than PEG (Grant  2009).  These  conflicting  results  from  two  meta-analyses should  be  interpreted  with  extreme  caution  because  all  the included studies were case series and not randomised controlled trials  (RCTs),  which  might  have  resulted  in  significant  bias.  In addition, disparities also existed between included studies in terms of survival rates. A longer survival was reported following PRG in\nChio 2004, whereas a more recent study reported the PEG and PRG to have similar 30-day and 1-year survival rates (Leeds 2010).\nTo  date,  a  definitive  conclusion  has  yet  to  be  reached  regarding which  technique,  PRG  or  PEG,  is  the  most  effective  for  the placement  of a gastric tube in individuals  with  swallowing disturbances; hence, it is important and necessary to carry out this systematic review.",

In  addition,  PEG may fail in individuals with a high subcostal stomach or obesity, because the optimal transillumination of the abdominal wall might be compromised (Laasch 2003; Thornton 2000). Other conditions, such  as  inflammatory  or  infiltrative  diseases  of  the  gastric  and abdominal wall, are considered relative contraindications to PEG (Nicholson 2000).",

The  presence  of  gastric varices  and  portal  hypertension  increases  the  risk  of  bleeding significantly, and these are seen as absolute contraindications to PRG. Percutaneous access to the stomach could be challenging if the individual has undergone colonic interposition; some authors regard this as a relative contraindication when using infracolonic methods (Mirich 1990). Similarly, the interposition of liver could be a relative contraindication with the use of computed tomography\nor  ultrasound  guidance  (Given  2005).  The  presence  of  ascites has previously been regarded as an absolute contraindication to PRG,  as  leakage  and  infection  of  ascites  may  occur  during  this procedure. However, some authors consider ascites only a relative contraindication to PRG, as the technique can be safely performed by carrying out pre-procedural paracentesis or gastropexy, or both (Shin  2010).  In  individuals  who  have  undergone  previous  gastric or  upper  gastrointestinal  surgery,  the  gastric  remnant  does  not distend  as  normal  stomach  does,  rendering  gastric  access  more difficult.  However, it is still  possible  to  find  an  appropriate  route for  gastrostomy  with  the  assistance  of  special  techniques  such as gastric distension using a balloon and computed tomography guidance (Foutch 1990; Sanchez 1992). As a result, a postoperative stomach  does  not  preclude  PRG  even  though  more  difficulties might be encountered.",

      "content": "The success rates reported for PEG and PRG vary markedly among studies,  and  could  be  reasonably  explained  by  differences  in participant  selection  and  operator  experience.  There  are  more contraindications to PEG than to PRG, and PEG is associated with more anatomical or technical limitations. In one study, individuals were usually converted to PRG when PEG was contraindicated or had failed, which may reflect the fact that PRG is superior to PEG in terms of technical feasibility (Thornton 2002). Some large series studies reported a higher success rate for PRG (99% to 100%) than for  PEG  (95.5  to  98%)  (de  Baere  1999;  Laasch  2003;  Leeds  2010; Rosenzweig  1994).  In  one  study,  which  included  20  participants with  amyotrophic  lateral  sclerosis,  the  success  rate  for  PEG  was reported to be as low as 55% (Thornton 2002). An historical metaanalysis  involving  5752  participants  concluded  that  the  rate  of successful  gastrostomy with PRG was higher than that with PEG (99.2%  versus  95.7%,  respectively).  However,  this  study  suffered a  major  limitation  in  that  most  studies  included  in  the  metaanalysis were not comparative studies (Wollman 1995). The most commonly reported reasons for the failure of PEG were obstacles impeding  the  insertion  of  the  endoscope  (e.g.  tumours  in  the upper gastrointestinal tract) and the difficulty of transilluminating the  anterior  abdominal  wall  (Desport  2005).  On  the  whole,  the current  evidence  favours  a  higher  success  rate  for  PRG  than  for PEG  in  the  general  population,  but  this  needs  to  be  validated in  RCTs.  Furthermore,  the  operator's  experience  and  facilities available should also be taken into consideration when choosing the technique.",

      "content": "Based on the available evidence, most authors support PEG and PRG  as  safe  procedures  for  enteral  feeding;  complications  are generally  infrequently  encountered,  although  both  techniques have the potential to cause mortality and morbidity. Documented major  complication  rates  for  PEG  and  PRG  are  0%  to  8%  and 1.4% to 5.6%, respectively (Chandu 2003; Dwyer 2003; Hujala 2004; Möller 1999; Neeff 2003; Rimon 2005). Complication rates for PEG and PRG have been compared directly in some studies; however, results were contradictory (Eze 2007; Grant 2009; Lawrance 2003; Neeff  2003;  Rustom  2006).  Some  studies  found  similar  results  in terms of complication rates for PEG and PRG (La Nauze 2012; Leeds 2010). However, a meta-analysis of earlier studies, including 5752 participants, which assessed outcomes for PEG and PRG found that major complications were less frequently seen with PRG than with PEG  (5.9%  versus  9.4%,  respectively),  and  that  30-day  mortality\nwas higher in the PEG group than in the PRG group (0.53% versus 0.3%,  respectively)  (Wollman  1995).  In  contrast,  another  metaanalysis that included 2379 individuals with head and neck cancer undergoing PEG or PRG found PRG to be associated with higher rates of major complications and mortality than PEG (Grant 2009). In a more recent systematic review that also assessed outcomes of PEG and PRG in individuals with head and neck cancer, evidence from four retrospective comparative studies favoured PEG over PRG with reference to mortality and peritonitis (Burkitt 2011). However, current  meta-analyses  have  some  common  limitations,  making it  difficult  to  draw  a  definitive  recommendation  as  to  the  safety of  either  method.  First,  most  studies  included  in  these  analyses were retrospective and not RCTs, and so are subject to significant reporting bias. Second, the majority of studies were characterised by a lack of detailed descriptions of participant selection criteria and  the  procedure  studied;  the  heterogeneous  nature  of  the population in whom percutaneous gastrostomy is indicated makes comparisons within the literature more difficult. Third, the small size  of  the  samples  in  most  studies  could  reduce  the  power  to detect significant differences between groups. Finally, the means by  which  complications  were  reported  were  inconsistent  among studies;  different  definitions  for  major  and  minor  complications could have led to confusion. To date, no RCT has been reported that has compared outcomes between PEG and PRG; hence, the currently  available  evidence  is  far  from  sufficient  to  determine which procedure is safer than the other.",

For most individuals, tube feeding via gastrostomy is  sustaining  in  the  long  term,  but  it  is  doubtful  that  all  feeding techniques may impact equally on nutritional status, quality of life and long-term survival. Assessing results over a long time frame (not only hospital stay, but also postdischarge) will give us more detailed information about the optimal feeding technique. Desport 2005 carried out a nutritional examination in 50 individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 364 (± 434) days after PEG or PRG and found a comparable improvement in nutritional status, as assessed by  weight,  triceps  skinfold  and  mid-arm  muscle  circumference, with  both  techniques.  No  significant  difference  in  survival  was found between groups (Desport 2005), consistent with the results of a previous study (Thornton 2002). Survival and nutritional status were also investigated in individuals with motor neurone disease following  enteral  tube  feeding;  again,  no  difference  in  survival between  individuals  undergoing  PEG  or  PRG  was  detected  (Rio 2010). In a mixed population, Leeds 2010 compared 170 PRGs with 233  PEGs  and  demonstrated  similar  30-day,  90-day  and  1-year survival between groups. This conclusion has been confirmed by other authors who found no significant difference in 30-day and 1year mortality rates between PEG and PRG within a median follow up of 405 days (La Nauze 2012). However, it was reported that tube function tended to be inferior with PRG within a median follow up\nof 17.2 months compared with PEG (PRG 58%; PEG 68%), but the difference did not reach statistical significance (Cosentini 1998).\nBeyond  clinical  outcomes  and  nutritional  status,  the  impact  of treatment on individuals' quality of life should also be taken into account  when  evaluating  a  gastrostomy  method.  Unfortunately, few studies have compared quality of life following PEG or PRG. A  study  in  100  participants  undergoing  PEG  assessed  quality  of life pre- and 6 months after PEG; a significant improvement from baseline  in  Quality  of  Life  Index  scores  was  achieved  with  PEG (19.25  ±  11.85  versus  30.08  ±  27.74)  (Hossein  2011).
