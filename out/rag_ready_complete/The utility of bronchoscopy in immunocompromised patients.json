The addition of biopsies to bronchoalveolar lavage improves the diagnostic yield of non-infectious etiologies, although the underlying etiology of the immunocompromised state must be considered and may be influential. Certain unknowns remain, including timing of bronchoscopy and its impact on medical management and mortality. The ongoing role of non-invasive testing for infectious complications prior to bronchoscopy also remains to be defined. This review addresses the role of bronchoscopy in immunocompromised states related to underlying hematologic malignancies, prescription drug use or chemotherapy, and other disorders that predispose patients to infectious or non-infectious pulmonary diseases.\nKeywords: Bronchoscopy; immunocompromised; next generation sequencing; metagenomics; opportunistic infections; bronchoalveolar lavage\nimmunocompromised patients with pulmonary infiltrates has been shown to improve survival (6). Bronchoscopy becomes especially important in patients that have persistent computed tomography (CT) findings and those that are unable to produce sputum (8,9). The diagnostic yield from bronchoscopy in these patients varies but can approach 70% ( Table 1 ).  Despite its high utility in this population, complications of bronchoscopy may occur in up to 50% of patients (10,32). As the use of organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCTs) expand and the repertoire of  chemotherapy  agents  and  immune  modulating therapies changes, the population of patients that are considered immunocompromised is anticipated to grow. The bronchoscopist must balance the benefits, potential diagnostic yield and complication rates when determining whether to proceed with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), transbronchial biopsies (TBB) or other approaches. In this paper, we will review the utility of bronchoscopy in specific populations of immunocompromised patients.",

      "title": "Solid organ transplant recipients",
      "content": "There is a wide range of pulmonary complications after solid organ transplant. Infection by a host of organisms remains the most common but consideration needs to be given to non-infectious complications such as acute transplant rejection, post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder  and  drug-induced  lung  disease  (33).  The epidemiology of these complications is outside of the scope of this paper but some of the factors that determine the most likely diagnoses include the type of transplant, degree of immunosuppression and time since transplant (34).\nThe overall diagnostic rate of bronchoscopy for patients with solid organ transplant and pulmonary disease is between 27-70% (35). When performed in conjunction with BAL, TBB yield a higher diagnostic rate in this population (11). In one study that included 27 renal transplant patients, TBB with BAL had a diagnostic rate of 57.5% compared to BAL alone (27.2%) (24). Additionally, there were significantly increased rates of detecting fungal and viral infections as well as hematologic malignancies involving the lung. Other studies have replicated this finding when the underlying etiology was secondary to  invasive  fungal  and  viral  infections,  malignancy, and interstitial diseases (e.g., organizing pneumonia) (11,24,34).\nOther tests beyond BAL and TBB may be needed. The role of mucosal brushing in patients with solid organ\ntransplant is not clear. In one retrospective study of 83 patients following lung-transplant, the use of mucosal brushing was shown to increase the diagnostic yield for bacterial pneumonia compared to BAL alone (17). These results have not reliably been extrapolated to other solid organ transplants or immunocompromised patients and in some cases, has even led to worsened outcomes (12,19). If only peripheral lung parenchymal disease is present, nonbronchoscopic techniques such as imaging (CT) guided biopsies may be considered (36).\nIn patients who have undergone lung transplant and documented acute rejection, bronchoscopy remains important for disease monitoring and grading (18). Its role for surveillance of acute rejection after lung transplant is debated (37).",

      "content": "Pulmonary complications occur in up to 60% of patients with forms of hematologic immunodeficiencies (7,38). Much like solid organ transplant patients, infection remains the most common pulmonary complication in this group. These patients can remain neutropenic for months, either undetected because of brewing malignancy or as a consequence of planning and engraftment during HSCT (39). Morbidity and mortality can be pronounced. Patients after HSCT with pulmonary infiltrates requiring mechanical ventilation have a mortality rate that can reach 90% (12,40). Not surprisingly, early recognition of the specific etiology of pneumonia in patients after HSCT improves survival (6,12).\nThe diagnostic rates of bronchoscopy in this patient population ranges from 42-65% (34). The highest diagnostic yield was seen in patients that undergo bronchoscopy within 24 hours of presentation (13). In one retrospective study of patients with hematologic malignancy and/or neutropenia, diagnostic yields for bronchoscopy increased if  the  patient had not yet received antimicrobials (20). Diagnostic rates overall appear to be improved when TBB are performed in addition to BAL for patients with HSCT and hematologic malignancy (11,24), but these can be a source of increased complication rates (14).\nA recently published study involved a pre-planned secondary analysis of a  prospective,  multinational, observational analysis of 1,611 immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory failure admitted to the\nintensive  care  unit  (ICU).  Patients  who  underwent bronchoscopy were compared to those with non-invasive testing. Bronchoscopy was performed in 618 patients who were more likely to have a hematologic malignancy and higher severity of illness score. Bronchoscopy alone achieved a diagnosis in 165 patients (27% adjusted diagnostic yield) and in management change in 236 patients (38% therapeutic yield). However, it was associated with worsening respiratory status in 69 (11%), higher ICU mortality (40% vs .  28%, P<0.0001) and hospital mortality (49 vs. 41%, P=0.003). The authors urged individualization of patients selected to undergo bronchoscopy given these findings (21).\nThe impact of bronchoscopy on medical management varies widely. Changes in medical management have been reported in 20-70% of patients who underwent HSCT or presented with febrile neutropenia (13,22). These changes include the addition or removal of antimicrobial agents, steroid dosing and anti-viral therapy. In many cases, however, despite the establishment of a specific diagnosis, management was not altered overall (15,16). In one study of 130 TBB's in patients having received a HSCT, biopsy results impacted the\nodds of a change in steroid dosing however had no overall changes in patients' management (15).",

      "title": "Patients with HIV",
      "content": "The use of anti-retroviral therapy has dramatically increased the life expectancy for patients living with HIV. In patients with HIV and T-lymphocyte CD4 counts <200 cells/mm 3 that  present with pulmonary infiltrates, infection remains the most common etiology, occurring in up to 80% of patients in a 1-year period of lymphopenia (41). A majority of these patients are located in a geographically and economically different parts of the world (e.g., SubSaharan Africa) that make them susceptible to different types of pulmonary infections (42) compared to HSCT, which happens most frequently in countries with higher gross national incomes (43). Up to 70% of patients with HIV will develop a pulmonary complication during their disease course (44).\nThe diagnostic yield of bronchoscopy for these patients remains high, especially for infectious etiologies (45). The yield of BAL for the diagnosis of bacterial infections\ncan be as high as 96% and is increased if performed prior  to  antibiotic  use  (46,47).  In  a  mixed  group  of immunocompromised patients presenting with fever, respiratory  symptoms  and/or  infiltrates  on  chest imaging, the overall diagnostic yield for patients with HIV was 48%, which was higher than the other groups of  immunocompromised patients studied (26). The diagnosis of fungal infections also remains high, with rates of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) detection on BAL between 96-98%, without significant benefit from TBB (48). TBB and endobronchial ultrasound (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)) remain important in diagnosing patients with noninfectious pulmonary disease, like Kaposi's sarcoma, and should be utilized in the appropriate scenario of mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. In one observational study of HIV infected patients with mediastinal lymphadenopathy, TBB biopsies and Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) had a diagnostic yield of almost 98% (25).\nDespite its high diagnostic yields, one center in the United Kingdom found a 60% decrease in the rates of bronchoscopy over a 10-year period in patients with HIV (49). This likely reflects both a decrease in pulmonary infections  and  as  well  as  improved  awareness  about opportunistic infections leading to empiric treatments. Despite this decrease, the utility of bronchoscopy in this group of patients remains relevant.",

For patients on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-targeted therapy, a variety of pulmonary manifestations exist. Pulmonary infection remains a common side effect (52). Additionally, these patients are at  risk  for  developing pulmonary nodules, fibrosis and pneumonitis (52-54). Patients receiving chemotherapy also have disruptions in their cell mediated immunity, similar to those who are on high-dose steroids, and can develop neutropenia (55). Overall for these patients, infection is the most common pulmonary complication (50,52,55).\nThe overall diagnostic yield for bronchoscopy in this group of patients is approximately 50% (23,27,55). In one cohort of patients receiving chemotherapy or highdose steroids for malignancy, the diagnostic yield for bronchoscopy with BAL was ~55% (55). TBB was also\nutilized with an increased number of diagnoses made, however the impact that it had on increasing diagnostic yield was not reported. In another prospective observational study that included patients with neutropenia from chemotherapy who were admitted to the ICU with pulmonary infiltrates, bronchoscopy had a 49% yield (23). Bronchoscopy changed management in only 28% of patients overall, but 62% of patients with proven infection.

It is primarily a diagnosis found in children although can sometimes present in adults. This group of diseases can present with an array of pulmonary disease. Unique to the other patient populations studied  in  this  review,  up  to  60%  of  patients  with immunodeficiency disease can have structural changes in the pulmonary tract (57). These changes include bronchial wall thickening and bronchiectasis, along with chronic airflow obstruction (58). This leads to increased rates of infection, specifically bacterial pneumonia, which remains the most common pulmonary complication affecting up to 86% of patients (58). Some less common causes of pulmonary disease in these patients include chronic inflammatory disease (e.g., sarcoidosis and interstitial pneumonias), lymphoproliferative disease and malignancy (57).\nData on the role of bronchoscopy in these patients is scarce. In one study of patients with immunodeficiency disorders presenting with pulmonary disease, an etiology was determined in 83% of cases (28). Infection was found to be the leading cause of disease with approximately 75% of patients having this as the primary etiology. TBB appears to be helpful in identifying causes not due to infection, including chronic inflammatory disease and benign disease (59).

In one study of 501 patients after HSCT, the yield of bronchoscopy was 2.5 times higher when performed within the first 4 days of presentation and highest when done within 24 hours (up to 75%) (13). Additionally, mortality was almost three times higher in the group that received bronchoscopy after 4 days. In another study, when antibiotic therapy was changed because of bronchoscopy results within 7 days of initiating treatment, mortality was significantly lower than those in whom a change was made after 7 days (29% vs .  71%, respectively) (29). This suggests a benefit of bronchoscopy when performed before 7 days of antibiotic therapy.\nDespite this data, pause may be prudent in patients presenting with acute respiratory failure who have received HSCT. In one prospective observational study of 15 ICUs in France, patients who had received HSCT that presented with acute respiratory failure underwent bronchoscopy (30). Acute respiratory failure was defined as tachypnea with a respiratory rate >30 breaths per minute or other signs of respiratory distress, a PaO2  <60 mmHg or the need for  mechanical ventilation. In this cohort, there was no difference in mortality, however greater than 1/3 of patients required mechanical ventilation after undergoing bronchoscopy. These results might suggest a more judicious and non-invasive approach in patients who have received HSCT that present with acute respiratory failure.",

The highest rates of complications are seen in patients who have TBB or other more invasive procedures than BAL during bronchoscopy (61,62). The rates of complications in patients who are immunocompromised appear to be similar or slightly higher than the general population. In one retrospective review of greater than 4,000 bronchoscopies, the rate of bleeding after TBB was ~2.8% (61). Comparatively, the range of bleeding after TBB in immunocompromised patients ranged from 4-15% (11,31,34). Pneumothorax after TBB is  approximately 4% (61) and appears to be similar for immunocompromised patients (31). Hypoxemia is generally transient after the procedure, although rates might be slightly increased in immunocompromised patients who have undergone bronchoscopy (1.8% vs . <0.1%) (34,60).

Making a timely and accurate diagnosis is critical for ensuring proper treatment. Bronchoscopy is often an important tool in determining the etiology of pulmonary disease, although its yield varies across the spectrum of  immunocompromised patients. The benefits of bronchoscopy in these patient populations are likely most apparent when completed as early as possible to facilitate diagnosis, even if it does not always lead to a change in management. Complications largely mirror that of the general population and should not prevent a bronchoscopic approach, including biopsies, when appropriate. However, individualized therapy weighing potential risks is essential. Additional studies evaluating the impact of non-invasive testing on bronchoscopy, such as sputum, blood or urine tests, are warranted.",
