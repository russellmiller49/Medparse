      "content": "Review question: We reviewed available evidence on the effects of early tracheostomy (≤ 10 days after tracheal intubation) as compared with late tracheostomy (> 10 days after tracheal intubation) in terms of mortality in critically ill patients who predicted to be on long-term artificial respiration.\nBackground: Tracheostomy is a surgical procedure in which an external artificial opening is made in the trachea (windpipe). Long-term mechanical ventilation (whereby a machine is used to mechanically assist breathing) is the most common situation for which tracheostomy is indicated for patients in intensive care units (ICUs). 'Early' and 'late' tracheostomies may be undertaken.\nStudy characteristics: The evidence is current to August 2013. We included eight studies with a total of 1977 patients allocated to either early or late tracheostomy. Four studies received financial support from different institutions that did not participate in the study or in preparing the content of the final publications. We reran the search in October 2014. We will deal with any studies of interest when we update the review.\nKey results: Patients receiving early tracheostomy had lower risk of mortality at the longest follow-up time available in seven studies that measured mortality (ranging from 28 days to two years of follow-up), as compared with patients subjected to a late tracheostomy. However, the available evidence should be considered with caution because information is insufficient regarding any subgroup(s) or individual characteristic(s) potentially associated with the best indications for early or late tracheostomy. According to available results, approximately 11 patients would need to be treated with an early instead of a late tracheostomy to prevent one death. Results concerning the time spent on mechanical ventilation are not definitive, but they suggest benefits associated with early tracheostomy. Two studies show a significantly higher probability of discharge from the ICU at 28 days of follow-up in the early tracheostomy group and no significant differences for pneumonia. Possible differences between early and late tracheostomy have yet to be adequately investigated in highquality studies because no information is available on the best indication for either early or late tracheostomy in patients with specific characteristics.\nQuality of the evidence: The  quality  of  the  evidence  varied  according  to  which  outcome was analysed. Evidence was considered of moderate quality for mortality and time spent on mechanical ventilation; of high quality for discharge from the ICU at day 28; and of very low and low quality for pneumonia and sternal wound infection, respectively. Clinical and methodological heterogeneities between studies were the main factors responsible for downgrading the quality of available evidence.\n3",

      "content": "Long-term mechanical ventilation is the most common situation for which tracheostomy is indicated for patients in intensive care units  (ICUs)  (Heffner  2001).  Although  the  definition  of  prolonged ventilation can include periods as short as 24 hours (Criner 1994; Griffiths  2005),  only  patients  who  are  foreseen  to  be  on  artificial ventilation for approximately 10 days or longer (Armstrong 1998; Plummer 1989) are generally subjected to elective tracheostomy. In this circumstance, tracheostomy is offered as a strategy to reduce respiratory injury and other undesired consequences of prolonged translaryngeal intubation. These  include  ventilator-associated pneumonia (Ranes 2006), sinusitis (Holzapfel  1993)  and  tracheal stenosis  (Cavaliere  2007).  Predictive  systems  have  been  used  to predict the duration of mechanical ventilation in various patient settings (Agle 2006; Gajic 2007; Légaré 2001; Sellers 1997), but many of  these  systems  are  not  appropriately  validated.  Several  other factors have also been shown, in studies, to provide indications for tracheostomy: neuromuscular disease, trauma, age, injury severity score, damage control laparotomy and others (Frutos-Vivar 2005; Goettler 2006). Some researchers have proposed that the decision to perform tracheostomy should be based on objective measures obtained  from  spontaneous  breathing  trials  or  from  trials  on weaning from mechanical ventilation  (Freeman  2008).  Thus,  the development of predictive methods that can be tailored for each clinical condition would be a major advance in patient care.",

      "title": "Description of the intervention",
      "content": "Tracheostomy is a surgical procedure whereby an external artificial opening is made in the trachea (Stedman 1995). Several techniques  are  used  to  perform  tracheostomy,  including  the classical standard surgical procedure completed in a surgical room and the percutaneous method performed at the patient's bedside (Friedman 2006; Gullo 2007; Pappas 2011; Schultz 2007). Surgical and percutaneous procedures are usually performed by different surgical specialists such as general; thoracic; ear, nose and throat (ENT);  or  maxillofacial  surgeons,  but  percutaneous  procedures are  usually  but  not  exclusively  performed  by  surgeons  and intensivists (Pappas 2011; Plummer 1989). A diversity of materials (equipment  and  designs)  are  used  in  performing  tracheostomy (Björling 2007; Crimlisk 2006; Hess 2005). These can be associated with complications such as tracheal ulceration, distortion of soft tracheal tissue and airway obstruction (Tibballs 2006).\nPlummer 1989 used the translaryngeal route for patients expected to be on mechanical ventilation for up to 10 days and tracheostomy for those on artificial ventilation for longer than 21 days; however, tracheostomy is usually performed between the 10th and 14th days of  intubation  (Armstrong  1998).  Nowadays,  opinions  regarding the  best  time  to  perform  tracheostomy  are  conflicting  (Heffner 2003). Relevant studies vary in design and in the clinical condition examined  (Ahmed  2007;  Barquist  2006).  To  circumvent  this, the  literature  offers  two  categories  of  'early'  and  'late'  for  the timing  of  tracheostomy.  Unfortunately  these  categories  are  not precisely  defined,  and  study  authors  may  characterize  different times as 'early' and 'late,' resulting in some overlap between the categories  (Aissaoui  2007;  Barquist  2006;  Dunham  2006;  Lesnik 1992).  Conflicting  evidence  is  available  on  the  advantages  of early  over  late  tracheostomy.  For  example,  some  comparative studies have reported shorter hospital stays, lower mortality rates\nand  other  benefits  with  the  use  of  early  as  compared  with  late tracheostomy (Arabi 2004; Rodriguez 1990). Conversely, Clec'h 2007 observed no differences in mortality in the ICU between patients undergoing early versus late tracheostomy.",

On  the  other  hand, some of the disadvantages of tracheostomy include dislodgement or obstruction, wound infection, scarring, a false passage, haemorrhage and subglottic and tracheal stenosis (Bartels 1998; Dollner 2002; Higgins 2007; Norwood 2000).",

Of these citations, we excluded a further 1359 on the basis of title and abstract, because they were not specifically related to the 'timing of tracheostomy.' From the remaining 107 studies, we excluded a further 84 because of their study design. Thus, 23 studies had the potential to be included in the review (Figure 1). Of those 23  studies,  four  were  ongoing  RCTs  and  one  has  been  awaiting assessment. We contacted the main authors of one of the remaining 18 studies to request further information on the comparison groups (Blot 2008). This study was later excluded for reasons outlined in the Characteristics of excluded studies table.\nWe  reran  the  search  in  October  2014  and  retrieved  204  new citations,  with  18  studies  referring  to  timing  of  tracheostomy.

The  review  authors  paid special attention to the sensitivity analysis that tested the effects of  studies excluded because their times of tracheostomy did not meet our inclusion criteria. This sensitivity analysis was done for\nmortality  at  the  longest  follow-up  time  available  in  the  studies. Although the results of this sensitivity analysis (please see Effects of  interventions  at  sensitivity  analysis)  may  not  be  considered in  our  conclusions,  they  were  very  similar  to  the  findings  of the  meta-analysis  of  included  studies,  in  spite  of  the  inclusion of  two  additional  excluded  randomized  controlled  trials  (RCTs) (Analysis  1.1).  At  30  days  of  follow-up,  only  one  study  (Rumbak 2004)  out  of  three  (Rumbak  2004;  Young  2013;  Zheng  2012) demonstrated  a  significant  difference  between  groups,  with  a lower mortality rate in the early tracheostomy group; thus, it was necessary to treat approximately three critically ill participants with early tracheostomy to prevent one death. Additionally, significant differences favouring the early tracheostomy group were reported by  Bösel  2013  at  180  days  and  until  ICU  discharge;  it  was necessary  to  treat  approximately  three  participants  with  early tracheostomy to prevent one death at both times of follow-up. No study demonstrated significant differences between early and late tracheostomy groups for mortality at 28, 60 and 90 days, and at one and two years of follow-up, nor until both ICU and hospital discharge.\nTwo  studies  combined  in  a  meta-analysis  contributed  to  the moderate-quality  evidence  found  to  support  the  absence  of differences between comparison groups for mean ventilator-free days  until  28  days  of  follow-up  (Trouillet  2011;  Zheng  2012). Individual studies, however, showed significantly less mean time spent in mechanical ventilation in the early tracheostomy group, with a mean reduction of 9.8 days in Rumbak 2004 and, in Terragni 2010, a longer median time in the early tracheostomy group of five ventilator-free days at 28 days of follow-up. Other individual studies showed  non-significantly  less  time  on  mechanical  ventilation in  the  early  tracheostomy  group  (Bösel  2013;  Dunham  1984; Trouillet 2011). In addition, Terragni 2010 demonstrated that early tracheostomy  is  significantly  associated  with  a  higher  rate  of successful weaning-an outcome related closely to time spent on mechanical ventilation.",

      "title": "Quality of the evidence",
      "content": "According to Summary of findings for the main comparison, the quality of the evidence was considered moderate for mortality at the longest follow-up time available in the studies. Besides clinical heterogeneity,  which  is  a  condition  naturally  present  among critically ill patients, the main suspected reason to downgrade the quality of evidence was the influence of three larger trials with more modest and statistically non-significant effect estimates (Terragni 2010; Trouillet 2011; Young 2013). Although small trials are prone to stronger estimate effects (Pereira 2012), it is far from assumed that they are inherently flawed (Batterham 2013). Moreover, Ioannidis 1998 considered that there exist more divergences between metaanalyses and large trials published in the more persuasive scientific journals,  and  that  the  latter  tend  to  be  preferred  over  metaanalyses.  Additionally,  some  study  authors  have  indicated  that when results from individual studies are fundamentally in the same direction  (consistency  across  studies),  the  meta-analysis  merits greater  confidence,  and  they  criticize  those  who  look  for  strict \"black and white\" conclusions in scientific research (Cook 1995; Hill 1965; McCormack 2013).\nAs  yet  we  have  not  included  sufficient  studies  to  enable  us  to explore publication bias. This bias can be considered a possibility because, in virtually all areas of knowledge, some investigators do not  make  their  studies  available,  particularly  those  studies  that show no effect (Song 2010). Apart from mortality, It was possible, however,  to  detect  distinct  qualities  of  evidence  for  the  same outcomes as measured in different ways. For example, the quality of  evidence  of  the  specific  outcome  of  ventilator-free  days  at  28 days  of  follow-up  was  graded  as  moderate,  and  the  outcome  of mean days of mechanical ventilation until 60 days of follow-up was considered to be of very low quality. Such a large divergence in the definitions of outcomes has been crucial in downgrading the quality of available evidence on this research question.",

Newly available studies, however, have helped prove, although still not definitively, the potential benefits of early tracheostomy as compared with late tracheostomy for mortality. Another systematic review carried out by Shan 2013 clearly supports the choice of early tracheostomy for reducing length of ICU stay, duration of mechanical ventilation and mortality, but the results apparently have been overestimated as a result of the inclusion of observational studies. In this sense, Scales 2008,  in  a  large  observational  study  involving  more  than  10,000 participants,  showed  that  early  tracheostomy  is  associated  with significant advantages over late tracheostomy in terms of mortality for  critically  ill  patients.  Previous  systematic  reviews,  as  well  as other observational studies and non-randomized controlled trials with  lower  methodological  rigour,  have  also  showed  decreased time  spent  on  ventilatory  support  (Arabi  2004;  Arabi  2009;  Blot 1995; Dunham 2006; Gandía-Martínez 2010; Griffiths 2005; Lesnik 1992;  Zagli  2010),  decreased  time  in  the  ICU  (Arabi  2004;  Arabi 2009, Gandía-Martínez 2010; Griffiths 2005; Lesnik 1992; Zagli 2010) and at the hospital (Arabi 2004; Arabi 2009; Blot 1995) and lower probabilities  of  pneumonia  (Gandía-Martínez  2010;  Lesnik  1992) and extubation (El-Naggar 1976) with early tracheostomy than with late tracheostomy.

Additionally, all primary outcomes of this review were considered objective, specifically mortality; then the studies were considered to have low risk of bias in the item relative to 'Blinding of Participants and Personnel,' as suggested in Chapter 8: Assessing risk of bias in included studies, from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011a).",
