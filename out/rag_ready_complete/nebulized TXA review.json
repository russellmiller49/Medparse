      "content": "Hemoptysis, defined as the expectoration of blood from the respiratory tract, can result from various conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)), bronchiectasis, infections, vasculitis, and malignancies. The severity of hemoptysis ranges from mild, self-limiting episodes to lifethreatening events, necessitating a spectrum of management strategies [1]. Mild cases often respond well to conservative treatments such as bed rest, oxygen therapy, and antibiotics. In contrast, severe cases may require more aggressive interventions like bronchial artery embolization, bronchoscopy, or surgical resection to control the source of bleeding. Although these invasive techniques can be effective, they carry inherent risks and may not be appropriate for all patients, particularly those with significant comorbidities or critical illnesses [1]. The complexity and urgency involved in managing hemoptysis highlight the need for treatment options that are both effective and minimally invasive [1].\nTranexamic acid (TXA), an antifibrinolytic agent, has recently garnered interest as a potential therapeutic option for hemoptysis, especially when administered via nebulization [2, 3]. TXA works by inhibiting fibrinolysis through the blockade of lysine-binding sites on plasminogen, thereby stabilizing blood clots and reducing further bleeding. Although TXA has been widely used systemically in various conditions, its nebulized form allows for direct, localized delivery to the lungs. This localized administration offers the potential to manage hemoptysis effectively while minimizing the risk of systemic clot formation [4].\nThis integrative review aims to evaluate the evidence on the use of nebulized TXA in the management of hemoptysis, focusing on its clinical effectiveness, safety profile, and potential benefits. Assessing its role in practice will help determine whether nebulized TXA can be established as a first-line treatment or serve as an adjunct to more invasive procedures in patients with hemoptysis.",

The full texts of 39 articles were then assessed for eligibility. Of these, six were comments or letters, six were conference abstracts, one did not involve nebulization, five were not accessible, five studies focused on post-tonsillectomy hemorrhage, and two reviews. Consequently, 14 studies were included in this analysis: five original studies [9-13], nine case reports [14-22]. Most patients were older adults, with a higher proportion of males, and common causes of hemoptysis included airway diseases and infections. The study selection process is depicted in Fig. 1.\nThis paper includes five original studies with a total of 311 patients. Two of the studies are randomized controlled trials, while three are non-RCTs. The patient population consists of both adults and pediatric patients, with TXA doses ranging from 250 to 500 mg, administered through intravenous injection, nebulization, or endotracheal instillation. The treatment duration varied based on patient condition, typically lasting for several days. (Details are shown in Table 1). The cases reviewed demonstrate the broad applicability of nebulized TXA in the management of hemoptysis across various conditions. Patients ranged\nin age from 14 to 82 and presented with conditions such as Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute respiratory distress syndrome (Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)), pulmonary embolism, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, and complications associated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Most cases utilized a standard dose of 500 mg of nebulized TXA every 8 h, typically administered for 3 to 5 days (Table 2 provides detailed patient information).",

In a RCT by Wand et al., 96% of patients treated with nebulized TXA (500 mg three times a day) achieved complete resolution of hemoptysis within five days, compared to 50% in the placebo group (p < 0.0005) [9]. Sanghvi et al. reported a case in which a 78-year-old patient experienced rapid bleeding control after receiving 2 g of nebulized TXA, leading to successful extubation on the third day [16]. The review further emphasizes that nebulized TXA effectively resolves nonmassive hemoptysis, making it a viable first-line treatment or an adjunct to other therapies [23]. Favorable outcomes were also observed in Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients on ECMO, with TXA contributing to stabilization and successful decannulation [17].\nHowever, some patients experienced only temporary relief. For example, an 82-year-old female with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage initially responded to TXA, but her hemoptysis recurred, leading to a transition to comfort care [14]. This suggests that while TXA provides immediate benefits, its long-term effectiveness may be limited in severe or irreversible conditions.",

However, most of the included studies are small in scale and many are case reports, which limits the strength of the evidence. Consequently, the conclusions drawn must be considered preliminary, given the limited scope of the available research.\nThe reviewed studies suggest a trend indicating that nebulized TXA may be effective, but further investigation is required, particularly regarding its role in different severities and etiologies of bleeding. While existing randomized controlled trials and observational studies suggest that nebulized TXA may help control non-massive hemoptysis, the quality of the evidence varies, and further high-quality research is needed to confirm these findings. For instance, Wand et al. found that 96% of patients treated with TXA experienced cessation of bleeding within five days, compared to 50% in the placebo group, suggesting that nebulized TXA might effectively stabilize patients [9]. Gopinath et al. also found that nebulized TXA might reduce hemoptysis volume and the need for invasive procedures compared to intravenous TXA, though larger trials are necessary to substantiate these results [10]. Preliminary case reports suggest that TXA may serve as both a non-invasive therapy and a bridge to definitive treatment. In complex cases, such as patients with Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) on ECMO described by Cabanilla et al., TXA appeared to control pulmonary bleeding, allowing for stabilization and weaning from mechanical support without surgery [13, 17]. However, these findings are based on small-scale studies and require confirmation through more robust research. Similarly, in resource-limited settings where access to interventional procedures is restricted, TXA may provide an initial option to control bleeding, but more research is needed to validate its efficacy in such scenarios. Nebulized TXA might reduce the need for invasive interventions in pediatric patients with hemoptysis, as demonstrated in the study by Bafaqih [13]. However, these findings are based on limited sample sizes and study designs, highlighting the need for more robust research. O'Neil et al. suggested that nebulized TXA could be both effective and safe for managing pulmonary hemorrhage in critically ill pediatric patients, but the lack of control groups limits the strength of these conclusions [12].\nThe potential for nebulized TXA to reduce healthcare resource utilization is promising. Wand et al. found that patients treated with TXA had shorter hospital stays (5.7 vs. 7.8 days) and required fewer invasive interventions [9]. However, these findings should be interpreted cautiously until confirmed by larger studies. While nebulized TXA may offer economic benefits by reducing the need for invasive procedures, further cost-effectiveness studies are needed to support these claims.\nSafety remains a critical consideration. Gopinath et al. reported two cases of bronchoconstriction, which were promptly managed with short-acting beta-agonists [10]. These incidents highlight the need for careful monitoring in patients with pre-existing respiratory conditions. Additionally, the long-term safety of nebulized TXA, particularly with repeated or prolonged use, remains uncertain. Future pharmacokinetic studies are necessary to evaluate potential systemic absorption and its safety, especially in patients with thrombotic risks.\nThe effectiveness of nebulized TXA compared with traditional treatments, especially for massive hemoptysis, is still unclear and requires further investigation. While TXA appears effective in non-massive or moderate cases, its role in massive hemoptysis is uncertain due to limited studies. Some case reports, such as those by Komura and Hankerson, suggest that TXA might stabilize severe bleeding before definitive interventions, but these findings are anecdotal and need further validation [9, 18, 19].\nStudies have used various regimens, ranging from 500 mg every 8 h to a single 2 g dose. While these regimens have shown effectiveness, the optimal dosing schedule, treatment duration, and patient selection criteria remain unclear. Establishing standardized guidelines through large, multicenter randomized controlled trials is necessary to optimize outcomes and minimize risks.\nWhile this review identifies a potential trend supporting the use of nebulized TXA for hemoptysis, particularly in non-massive cases, the current evidence is insufficient for definitive conclusions. More high-quality studies, including cohort studies and randomized controlled trials, are essential to provide stronger evidence and establish clear guidelines for its use in clinical practice.",

      "title": "Limitations",
      "content": "Despite promising results, current research on nebulized TXA for hemoptysis is limited, primarily consisting of case reports and small-scale trials. This restricts the generalizability of findings and makes it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about TXA's efficacy across diverse populations due to the absence of large, multicenter RCTs. Many studies also have short follow-up periods, focusing on acute bleeding control without long-term data on recurrence rates, patient outcomes, or potential delayed complications.\nAnother limitation is the heterogeneity in patient populations, underlying conditions, and TXA dosing regimens. Patients had varying etiologies for hemoptysis-ranging from Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and bronchiectasis to Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and malignancies-making it challenging to establish a standardized treatment protocol. The variability in dosing (100 mg to 2 g per session) and treatment duration (single doses to several\ndays) further complicates determining the optimal therapeutic regimen.\nMost studies excluded patients with massive hemoptysis, concentrating on non-massive cases. This raises questions about the safety and effectiveness of nebulized TXA in severe cases requiring rapid and aggressive intervention. The unclear role of TXA in massive hemoptysis warrants further investigation, especially since some studies suggest it might be more effective as a bridging therapy rather than a definitive solution in such scenarios.\nAdditionally, there is limited data on the potential systemic absorption of nebulized TXA and its long-term safety in patients with coagulation disorders or those on anticoagulant therapy. The risk of thromboembolic events with prolonged or repeated use in high-risk patients has not been fully explored. Further pharmacokinetic and safety studies are needed to assess systemic effects, especially in patients with compromised respiratory function or pre-existing thrombotic risk factors.\nIn summary, while nebulized TXA shows promise in treating hemoptysis, current evidence is constrained by small sample sizes, variability in treatment protocols, and a lack of long-term outcome and safety data. Future large-scale RCTs are essential to establish standardized guidelines and determine the optimal use of TXA in different clinical scenarios, including massive hemoptysis and high-risk populations.",
