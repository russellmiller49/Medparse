      "content": "The objective of this investigation was to explore whether the M categories developed by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) Staging and Prognostic Factors Committee (SPFC) for the eighth edition of the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation for lung cancer require modi /uniFB01 cation. For this purpose, a new prospective IASLC database was developed. Since the IASLC published their recommendations for the eighth edition M categories for Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 1 multiple developments in diagnosis, imaging, and treatment of Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have emerged. Particularly relevant is the emerging concept of oligometastatic disease as a unique entity with speci /uniFB01 c and possibly curative treatment options. 2 -6\nSince the last database which consisted of patients diagnosed and treated between 1999 and 2010, clinical practice now routinely includes positron emission tomography staging, minimally invasive endoscopic and surgical methods for diagnostic evaluation. A consensus de /uniFB01 nition of oligometastatic disease has been proposed with several issues remaining unresolved such as the role and optimal modality of local therapy in the setting of targeted therapies and immunotherapy, selection for local therapy, and varying de /uniFB01 nitions of oligometastases and oligoprogression. 7,8 Therapy has also rapidly involved to include local ablative therapies such as surgical resection\nand precision stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) for both primary and metastatic lesions, particularly metastases-directed SABR in select cases with a low tumor burden when combined with targeted therapy or immunotherapy. 9 New systemic treatments, including immune checkpoint inhibitors and molecular-targeted agents in tumors with actionable driver mutations, are now standard of care, supplementing conventional chemotherapy. Collectively, these novel treatments have improved systemic control of Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for many.\nThe improvement in systemic control of metastatic disease, together with global diffusion of advanced imaging such as positron emission tomography, and new possibilities for de /uniFB01 nitive treatment of single metastatic lesions mandate critical analyses of the prospectively collected IASLC ninth edition 2011 to 2019 database to develop proposals for the M categories of the ninth edition TNM classi /uniFB01 cation. 10\nOn the basis of the recommendations of the IASLC SPFC, the prospective data set had included several variables for potentially relevant revisions of the M categories. The collected information (number of variables and sample size) far exceeded that available for the eighth edition TNM stage classi /uniFB01 cation of lung cancer. The data were evaluated by the IASLC SPFC M factor subcommittee.\nHere, the overall /uniFB01 ndings generated from the ninth edition database are reported based on published guiding principles. 10 Additional possible research directions for future developments are also proposed based on documentation of parameters for the next database revision.",

This ninth edition analysis evaluated both EDC and batch data sets that provided suf /uniFB01 cient information on the multiplicity\nof metastatic lesions. The number of tumors used in a particular analysis was based on the availability of data to address the analysis question. For example, analyses of the number of lesions required discrete lesion counts per organ system, whereas analysis of the number of metastatic extrathoracic sites required only identi /uniFB01 cation of the sites and whether single site/single lesion or single site/multiple lesions or multiple sites were involved. Notably, for the ninth edition revision, international participants contributed more batch data, from which tumors were excluded if the batch data lacked essential elements needed for revision of the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation. 15",

General statistical methodology was similar to that used for the analysis of the T and the N components and stage groups of the ninth edition of the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation. 10,12 -14\nOverall survival (OS) was measured from the date of diagnosis to the date of death. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, with the log-rank test used to compare survival outcomes. Optimal cutpoints for continuous variables with respect to a survival outcome were identi /uniFB01 ed using the running log-rank method, with a permutation test used to identify the approximate p value of the cutpoint. Primary comparisons of survival between groups of tumors with neighboring M categories and between stage groups IVA versus IVB were assessed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression, adjusting for covariates of age, sex, region, cell type, and stratifying the analysis by the ability to identify integer counts of metastatic lesions per organ system based on data source. All survival and regression analyses were performed using SAS System for Windows, version 347 9.4.\nThree questions were considered for potential revisions of the M categories, which are as follows:\n1. Is there a prognostic difference whether a presumed malignant pleural effusion is cytologically con /uniFB01 rmed or not?\n2. Can prognostic thresholds be identi /uniFB01 ed based on the following:\na. size of the largest metastatic lesion?\nb. number of metastatic lesions?\nc. number of metastatic sites (organs)?\n3.

This includes 2839 patients with data entered directly into the EDC system and 12,098 patients with data submitted by means of batch data sets. 15 Of the 12,098 batch data patients, 780 were from the North American SWOG 0819 study, for which M descriptors including the number of metastatic lesions were entered directly into the EDC system. In combination with data exclusively entered by EDC, this yields a total of 3619 patients from data sets with integer counts of lesions per metastatic organ system, in contrast to the remainder of batch patients (11,318), where only the organ systems and distinction of single versus multiple lesions were recorded. As such, many key results feature analyses of patients grouped or strati /uniFB01 ed by EDC and SWOG-0819 versus the rest to re /uniFB02 ect grouping of patients by the ability to quantify metastatic lesions.\nThe 14,937 total patients were classi /uniFB01 able as having M1a (5410), M1b (1929), or M1c (7598) disease (Table 1).\nAdenocarcinoma was the most common histologic type (n ¼ 11,108, 74.4%); squamous cell carcinoma was the next most common (n ¼ 2531, 16.9%). 15 Of the 14,210 patients with available data on therapy to the primary tumor, 13,500 (95%) were treated with a nonsurgical approach.

In addition, separate analyses were performed for tumors whose M1a category by eighth edition stage classi /uniFB01 cation criteria was determined by the presence of any subset of M1a descriptors including associated pleural effusions and for tumors whose M1a category designation was solely determined by the presence of a pleural effusion.\nAmong patients with tumors categorized as M1a due to a pleural effusion along with other potential M1a descriptors, there was no strong evidence of a survival difference for those with positive cytology result (n ¼ 432) compared with those without cytologic con /uniFB01 rmation (n ¼ 386) ( p value ¼ 0.09, Supplementary Fig. 2 A ). Similarly, in patients with M1a disease exclusively due to malignant pleural effusion, there was no strong evidence of a survival difference for those with positive cytology result (n ¼ 203) compared with those without cytologic con /uniFB01 rmation (n ¼ 238) ( p value ¼ 0.22, Supplementary Fig. 2 B ). These /uniFB01 nding should be interpreted with caution due to potential confounders, for example, investigators who categorized cytologically negative pleural effusions as M1a for database submission were doing so because the clinical context strongly suggested this diagnosis given the observation that up to half of\nmalignant pleural effusions can test as cytologically negative, including potential sample size/power limitations.",

The most frequent metastatic organ systems for which lesion size data were available were the brain (n ¼ 244), liver (n ¼ 120), adrenals (n ¼ 108), bone (n ¼ 84), and lymphatic system (n ¼ 76). Altogether, 552 patients had at least one assessable lesion with size data available. For the lesion of maximum size for these 552 patients, the mean size was 2.6 cm (SD 2.2), median size was 2.0 cm with a range of 0.1 to 19.2 cm after removal of zero values (three patients), and outliers were reported as 60 cm or greater (two tumors).\nAn optimal cutpoint analysis with respect to OS was undertaken for this limited data set of 552 patients with eighth edition stages of M1b or M1c. The optimal cutpoint was identi /uniFB01 ed at 1.2 cm (Supplementary Fig. 3 A ).\nAn exploratory analysis revealed better survival for patients with tumors with a maximal metastatic lesion size below a cutpoint of 1.0 cm (rounded) compared with larger metastatic lesions ( p value ¼ 0.02, Supplementary Fig. 3 B ). Overall differences in outcome were also observed between patient subgroups when grouped simultaneously by M component (M1b versus M1c) and maximum metastatic lesion size ( p value ¼ 0.003, Supplementary Fig. 3 B ).\nNevertheless, the number of cases with a recorded metastatic lesion size was insuf /uniFB01 cient to permit validation of the cutpoint or to allow evaluation of the\nEDC, electronic data capture; SWOG, Southwest Oncology Group.\ngeneralizability of the prognostic impact.

Specifically, suf /uniFB01 cient numbers of cases were available to allow several analyses, including division into multiple subgroups with empiric thresholds of three, /uniFB01 ve, or seven metastatic lesions (Supplementary Table 4), which have been suggested by other investigators.\nAn optimal cutpoint analysis identi /uniFB01 ed seven lesions as the optimal cutpoint (i.e., seven or fewer compared with eight or more; Supplementary Fig. 4 A ). Nevertheless, this was not a training set/validation set analysis due to the number of cases.\nKaplan-Meier survival curves revealed a trend toward progressively worse OS of patient subgroups with an increasing number of metastatic lesions (2 -3, 4 -5, 6 -7, and 8 þ lesions, p value < 0.0001, Supplementary Fig. 4 B ). Although each of the subgroup was statistically different compared with the subgroup with a single metastasis (eighth edition M1b), the differences of the adjacent subgroups with 2 to 3, 4 to 5, 6 to 7 and 8 þ lesions were not statistically different.\nThe prognostic impact of the number of lesions was also analyzed by dichotomizing according to the empiric thresholds suggested by others. Each of the examined empiric thresholds ( /C20 3 versus /C21 4; /C20 5 versus /C21 6; /C20 7 versus /C21 8) revealed signi /uniFB01 cantly different outcomes in the dichotomized multiple lesion categories (Supplementary Fig. 4 C ) and in comparison to patients with a single metastasis (eighth edition M1b).\nThus, the number of metastatic lesions seems to be a continuum, without a clear in /uniFB02 ection point. Furthermore, there were insuf /uniFB01 cient data to investigate the impact of confounding by treatment -that is, patients with less extensive metastatic disease may have been treated more aggressively, including de /uniFB01 nitive local therapy of metastases.

This analysis revealed progressively worse survival with increasing number of organ systems with metastases,\nwith statistically signi /uniFB01 cant differences for each group compared with the next adjacent group ( p < 0.0001).\nThe prognostic impact of the number of organ systems with metastases was further according to M1c subgroups dichotomized by the following three empiric candidate thresholds: greater than or equal to two sites (versus one), greater than or equal to three sites (versus one to two), and greater than or equal to four sites (versus one to three). For each of these thresholds, statistically signi /uniFB01 cant differences were noted between one metastasis (M1b), the M1c subgroup below the threshold, and the M1c subgroup above the threshold ( p < 0.0001, Supplementary Fig. 5 B ).\nPotential confounding from possible prognostic differences related to speci /uniFB01 c organs was investigated (e.g., brain compared with liver). Among patients with tumors involving a single metastasis (eighth edition M1b), those with a brain metastasis experienced the best survival, with a median OS of 1.6 years (1.3, 1.9) and a statistically signi /uniFB01 cant difference relative to other frequently involved organs ( p value < 0.0001, Supplementary Fig. 6 A ). Nevertheless, there were no OS differences by organ system for patients with tumors involving multiple lesions in a single organ system ( p value ¼ 0.40, Supplementary Fig. 6 A ).\nFurthermore, OS was compared in patients with brain lesions versus those with metastatic lesions at any other distant site among cohorts with a single metastasis and with multiple metastases con /uniFB01 ned to a single site. The analyses similarly con /uniFB01 rmed a better prognosis for patients with M1b single brain metastasis versus other M1b sites (log-rank p value < 0.0001) but not for patients with multiple extrathoracic metastases in the brain compared with patients with multiple extrathoracic metastases in other sites (log-rank p value ¼ 0.22, Supplementary Fig. 6 B ).\nA sensitivity analysis evaluated the OS of patients with tumors involving a single metastasis versus single site with multiple lesions versus multiple site tumors, after excluding the brain, liver, and either brain or liver metastasis (Supplementary Fig. 7 A ). Distinct survival curves were observed between patients with eighth edition M1a versus M1b (single metastasis) tumors when brain lesions but not liver lesions were excluded. Nevertheless, survival differences persisted whether or not brain or liver metastases were excluded for patients with tumors involving a single metastasis versus a single organ system with multiple metastases, versus multiple organ systems.\nPrognostic differences according to the extrathoracic metastatic site were still evident when the analyses excluding the brain and liver and either liver or brain lesions were run separately for only EDC and SWOG-\n0819 cases or for only batch cases (Supplementary Fig. 7 B ).\nSimilarly, when survival curves for patients with M1c tumors were compared with the reference group of patients with M1b tumors, the Kaplan-Meier curves seem heterogeneous for the common extrathoracic metastatic sites of the brain, liver, and bone (Supplementary Fig. 7 C ), again supporting the hypothesis of differing prognostic impact by organ system. We could not assess whether these observations re /uniFB02 ect inherent biologic differences related to the site of metastases or differences in treatment policies (e.g., increased use of SABR or resection of brain metastases as compared with other sites of metastasis).",

This was the basis for the eighth edition M1a, M1b, and M1c categories ( p value < 0.0001, Fig. 1).\nThe ninth edition data set involves a much larger population consisting of both EDC and batch data\n(Fig. 1), whereas the eighth edition was based exclusively on data entered into the EDC system.\nKaplan-Meier analyses of the current database reveal that patients with tumors involving multiple metastatic extrathoracic lesions in one organ system have survival outcomes (median OS 1.0 [0.9, 1.0] y) that fall in-between that of patients with tumors involving a single extrathoracic metastatic lesion (eighth edition M1b, median survival 1.2 [1.1, 1.3] y) and that of patients with tumors involving metastatic lesions at multiple organ systems (median OS 0.6 [0.6, 0.7] y, p value < 0.0001, Fig. 1).\nStemming from this analysis, the M subcommittee extensively investigated the following four M1 categories: intrathoracic metastases (same as eighth edition M1a, i.e., pleural/ pericardial involvement or contralateral separate tumor nodules), a single extrathoracic metastasis (same as eighth edition M1b), multiple metastases at a single extrathoracic organ system (M1c1), and multiple metastases involving multiple organ systems (M1c2). These four categories are referred to as ' proposed 9 th edition M1 categories ' in this paper.\nSensitivity subset analyses consistently revealed the progressively lower OS of patients with tumors involving a single extrathoracic metastasis (M1b) versus multiple lesions at one extrathoracic organ system (M1c1) versus multiple metastases at multiple extrathoracic sites (M1c2). The differences between these three patient cohorts were apparent when viewing the EDC/SWOG data or only the batch data (Supplementary Fig. 8 A ).

Similarly, the differences between the three cohorts of patients with extrathoracic metastases also remained reasonably evident in patients from all regions (the smaller sample sizes in analyses involving Australia and South/Central America limited the statistical assessment; Supplementary Fig. 8 E ).\nSurvival of patients in the EDC data set was better than that in the batch data set, particularly for tumors with less metastatic burden (M1a and one extrathoracic metastasis [M1b]). Batch data sets frequently had missing data and were generally not constructed in a way conducive to determining whether missing data were simply missing or indicative of negative results for key data /uniFB01 elds such as prior therapies received, pretreatment testing, and comorbidities. This de /uniFB01 ciency presented an impediment to identifying causes of the apparent survival discrepancies found when comparing the data sources (Supplementary Table 1c and d).\nFinally, strati /uniFB01 ed multivariable Cox regression modelling was undertaken to compare the OS of patients with tumors involving one of the proposed ninth edition M1 categories -eighth edition M1a, a single extrathoracic metastasis (eighth edition M1b), multiple lesions in one organ system (M1c1), and multiple extrathoracic organ systems (M1c2), while adjusting for four key predictors of age ( /C21 65 y versus younger), sex, histology (squamous versus other), and geographic region (Asia versus other), and stratifying by data source (EDC þ SWOG-0819 versus batch, excluding SWOG0819). The data source strati /uniFB01 cation provides a more precise Hazard ratio (HR) estimate by adjusting for baseline hazard differences, arising in part from differences in\navailability of lesion count data between data sources (Supplementary Table 2).\nThe strati /uniFB01 ed multivariable analyses in Table 2 reveal progressively worse survival for patients with tumors involving the four potential ninth edition M1 categories (eighth edition M1a, single extrathoracic metastasis [M1b], single metastatic organ system/multiple lesions [M1c1], and multiple metastatic organ systems [M1c2]). Each potential M category reveals an increased Hazard ratio (HR) (worse survival) compared with M1a, and each of these comparisons is statistically signi /uniFB01 cant after adjustment for other factors (HRs for these are also revealed).\nTable 3 reveals results for the strati /uniFB01 ed adjusted multivariable regression analysis when the proposed ninth edition M1 categories are applied to proposed stage groups. The proposed stage groups would maintain the traditional alignment, namely including M1a and M1b in stage IVA, and include the two proposed M1c categories in stage IVB. It can be found that stage IVB exhibits signi /uniFB01 cantly worse survival (Hazard ratio (HR) > 1) compared with stage IVA after strati /uniFB01 cation and adjustment for confounders.",

      "content": "The eighth edition of the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation for lung cancer separated prognostically distinct categories of metastatic disease and has been well validated since its inception. 16,17 It classi /uniFB01 ed M1 categories as M1a, M1b (single metastatic lesion), and M1c (multiple extrathoracic metastases in either a single organ or multiple organ systems). Patients with tumors involving a single extrathoracic metastasis (M1b) were found to have a prognosis similar to patients with tumors in the M1a\nCI, con /uniFB01 dence interval; Hazard ratio (HR), hazard ratio; n, number of cases; N, total number of evaluable cases; N/A, not applicable.\ncategory. Patients with tumors involving a single extrathoracic metastasis had better prognosis than those with tumors involving multiple extrathoracic metastatic lesions in one or multiple organs (M1c).\nSince then, the value of metastasis-directed ablative therapies has emerged, particularly in the setting of modern targeted therapies and immunotherapy, leading to a need to consider re /uniFB01 nements to the M categories. The ninth edition database involves prospectively collected cases of lung cancer diagnosed between 2011 and 2019; data were submitted to the IASLC database through the EDC or by batch data sets. The ninth edition data set was much larger than the eighth edition data set, particularly with respect to the M category. Importantly, the eighth edition M categories were validated in the ninth edition database (Supplementary Fig. 1). The data suggest generally improved survival in stage IV patients in the ninth edition database compared with the previous edition database (Fig. 1).\nThe data elements for the ninth edition database were designed and implemented in 2011 and could not anticipate the dramatic evolution of how stage IV Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is managed. Speci /uniFB01 cally, the importance of molecular pro /uniFB01 ling, the number of metastatic lesions, and the treatments used were not as apparent in 2011. 18,19 Further limitations arose from incompleteness of data submitted for some variables. It is thus strongly recommended that future data submissions are made to an updated and revised EDC database in preference to batch data, to capture all relevant data systematically and comprehensively to avoid the heterogeneity and inconsistency encountered for this edition.\nThe effort to develop proposals for revision of the M categories focused on several clinical questions. One issue was to explore whether an optimal de /uniFB01 nition of oligometastatic disease could be identi /uniFB01 ed. Speci /uniFB01 cally, the current ninth edition database was interrogated for information on the number of metastatic lesions, size of individual metastatic lesions (size of largest lesion), and\nnumber of involved organs with metastatic lesions. In addition, the M subcommittee explored whether survival of patients with a presumed malignant pleural effusion was altered whether the effusion was cytologically con /uniFB01 rmed or not.\nRegarding the M1a pleural effusion designation, we do not propose any changes to the Union for International Cancer Control TNM Classi /uniFB01 cation of Malignant Tumors, eighth edition descriptor footnote: ' Most pleural (or pericardial) effusions in patients with lung cancer are due to tumor. In a few patients, however, multiple microscopic examinations of pleural (or pericardial) /uniFB02 uid are negative for tumor, and the /uniFB02 uid is nonbloody and is not an exudate. When these elements and clinical judgment dictate that the effusion is not related to the tumor, the effusion should be excluded as a staging descriptor. '\nWe attempted to analyze tumor burden using the size of the largest metastatic lesion as a crude index. Optimal cutpoint analysis suggested a threshold of 1.2 cm (Supplementary Fig. 3 A and B ). Although this size threshold correlated with a statistically signi /uniFB01 cant impact on OS, the sample size was too small to permit validation and assessment of generalizability. Thus, these observations are considered to be hypothesis generating. Although the concept is intuitively plausible, there are also likely confounders, such as the ability to ablate smaller versus larger lesions. It may be that metastatic lesion size is more appropriate as a parameter for treatment guidelines than for stage classi /uniFB01 cation. Ongoing data collection is recommended with suf /uniFB01 cient detail for further evaluation in the future tenth edition revision.\nThe M subcommittee investigated whether a de /uniFB01 nition of oligometastatic disease could be identi /uniFB01 ed from the data and included as an M descriptor. The unbiased optimal cutpoint analysis of available data without training/test set division suggested the optimal statistical cutpoint was seven lesions (i.e., seven or fewer compared with eight or more) (Supplementary Fig. 4 A ),\nand a statistically signi /uniFB01 cant OS difference was apparent when multiple extrathoracic metastasis was dichotomized at this threshold. Nevertheless, OS differences were also noted when other dichotomized thresholds (e.g., three or /uniFB01 ve) were used, and a nondichotomized analysis suggested that there is a continuum of worsening prognosis with an increasing number of metastatic lesions.\nFurthermore, the data available do not allow analysis of the potential interaction between the number of lesions and how often de /uniFB01 nitive local therapy was used. From a stage classi /uniFB01 cation perspective, it is important to identify characteristics that inherently affect prognosis -these are likely to remain relatively stable and generalizable. Nevertheless, it is crucial to distinguish inherent prognostic characteristics from characteristics that drive treatment selection. Treatment selection is eminently controllable by the provider; the associated prognosis is by nature constantly changing as treatment evolves. Furthermore, treatment selection characteristics are best assessed as a continuum that is weighed along with other considerations. Therefore, the M subcommittee concluded that the number of lesions is best left as a clinical consideration; the analysis suggests this is not amenable to dichotomization at a threshold that re /uniFB02 ects an inherent biologic in /uniFB02 ection point.\nAnalysis of the much larger ninth edition database was able to reveal that the eighth edition M1c category consists of two prognostically distinct groups. Patients with tumors involving multiple metastatic lesions at one extrathoracic organ system (M1c1) have signi /uniFB01 cantly better OS than patients with tumors involving metastatic lesions at multiple extrathoracic organ systems (M1c2). This was consistent in several statistical approaches and in multiple subset analyses (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 8 A -E , and Table 2). This is also consistent with external literature, albeit in a smaller retrospective cohort. 20\nThere is an argument for biological plausibility to support separating the M1c category into metastases at a single organ system versus multiple metastatic organ systems -the former could be expected to have a lower metastatic tumor burden and a better prognosis as suggested by clinical studies. 21 -24 Unfortunately, the current data set did not allow us to adequately quantify metastatic tumor burden. We strongly recommend collecting granular lesion size and count data to inform analyses for the next revision of the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation, speci /uniFB01 cally to enable an adequately powered analysis of the prognostic interaction of combined number of extrathoracic metastatic organ systems and number of metastases. This analysis will be important for validating empiric de /uniFB01 nitions of oligometastatic disease, such as the popular de /uniFB01 nition of /uniFB01 ve or fewer\nmetastatic lesions in three or fewer extrathoracic organ systems.\nAn issue is how an organ system should be de /uniFB01 ned. This question is not addressed in the general stage classi /uniFB01 cation rules of the Union for International Cancer Control or American Joint Committee on Cancer. This is straightforward when dealing with a localized single organ such as the brain or the liver. We consider paired organs such as the kidneys or adrenals also to represent one organ system. Conceptually, more dif /uniFB01 cult is how to view diffuse organs such as the skeleton. In the data available for our analysis, such lesions at such sites were considered to involve one organ system -for example, multiple metastases involving only the skeleton were analyzed in the M1c1 group. Therefore, the M1c1 de /uniFB01 -nition should be applied to an organ system, regardless whether the organ is solitary, paired, or diffuse throughout the body.\nAnother issue is whether there should be a limit to the number of metastatic lesions in a single organ system. We do not have data to address this. Furthermore, this is likely a clinical issue that plays into judgment about the optimal treatment strategy for a patient and not an issue amenable to dichotomization according to a biologically inherent threshold. From a ninth edition stage classi /uniFB01 cation standpoint, any number of metastases more than one at a single extrathoracic site should be classi /uniFB01 ed as M1c1. At the same time, we recognize that the clinical management of M1c1 patients may be varied and in /uniFB02 uenced by the number of lesions (and other factors).\nExploratory analysis has suggested potential prognostic differences between M1 subsets of EDC tumors compared with batch data (Supplementary Fig. 8 A ) and between M1 subsets involving different organs, in particular M1 tumors with brain involvement (Supplementary Fig. 7 A ), which may stimulate research for the tenth edition revision.\nIn conclusion, the following proposals are made for the M1 descriptors in the ninth edition of TNM classi /uniFB01 -cation of lung cancer (Table 4):\n1. M1a -no change from the eighth edition\n2. Size of largest metastatic lesion is not recommended to be included as a descriptor\n3. The number of metastatic lesions is not recommended to be included as a descriptor\n4. M1c is subdivided into (a) multiple extrathoracic metastases in a single organ system (proposed M1c1) and (b) multiple extrathoracic metastases in multiple organ systems (proposed M1c2)\n5. No change to stage groups IVA and IVB\nStage classi /uniFB01 cation is a nomenclature to describe the anatomic extent of a cancer. By providing a universal\nlanguage, it fosters communication about speci /uniFB01 c patients, the applicability of clinical trial results to a particular patient and helps de /uniFB01 ne prognosis of a collection of patients with a similar anatomic extent of cancer. Nonetheless, it is important to note the distinction between prognosis and tumor extent, the latter is what the TNM system determines. Stage classi /uniFB01 cation has historically focused more on tumors with limited extent rather than metastatic disease. In part, this is due to the available data, and in part, because anatomic extent is an important characteristic when local therapies are considered, and less important relative to other tumor characteristics (e.g., molecular pro /uniFB01 ling) when systemic therapies are appropriate. Over time, however, patient management increasingly involves a combination of systemic and local therapies. The greater number of advanced stage cases allowed the committee to assess and propose re /uniFB01 nements of the M categories. Although further work is needed, it represents an evolution of stage classi /uniFB01 cation, specifically seeking to de /uniFB01 ne anatomic tumor characteristics of advanced lung cancer which are generalizable and useful in discussions of individual patient management.\nHowever, it is strongly emphasized that introduction of the new M categories for the ninth edition is not intended to affect contemporary best practice. 25 For instance, a patient with a single brain metastasis and a single bone metastasis would be staged as M1c2 with the new proposal, whereas a patient with multiple (e.g., nine) metastatic lesions in a single extrathoracic organ system (e.g., liver) would have the lower M1c1 stage. Nevertheless, in clinical practice, the former patient could be treated as having ' oligometastatic disease ' with more aggressive metastasis-directed treatment with anticipation of a better outcome than the latter patient in the lower M1 category. This example underscores that a stage classi /uniFB01 cation cannot address all nuances and cannot de /uniFB01 ne what the optimal treatment strategy is for an individual. Moreover, the ninth edition proposals were unable to be strati /uniFB01 ed by actionable mutation therapy or immunotherapies received, both of\nwhich can lead to meaningful survival bene /uniFB01 ts for individuals.\nNonetheless, these ninth edition proposals should help to identify subsets of tumors with a more favorable prognosis and patients for whom curative treatments could be considered and start the journey to collate enough data of suf /uniFB01 cient granularity to optimally describe the ' oligometastatic ' state; ' the devil is in the detail. ' The proposed changes to the M categories maintain the compatibility with the M categories of the previous edition, help us to better understand the concept of oligometastatic disease, and improve our capacity to indicate prognosis and offer optimal treatments, which is the ultimate objective of the TNM classi /uniFB01 cation in lung cancer. 1,10,15,26,27",
