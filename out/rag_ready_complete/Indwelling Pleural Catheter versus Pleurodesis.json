The annual incidence of MPE in the United States is estimated to be greater than 150,000, and MPE accounts\nfor 42 -77% of all exudative effusions in adults (2). Symptoms of MPE include often debilitating breathlessness, chest pain, and constitutional symptoms such as anorexia and weight loss. Generally considered a\nmanifestation of terminal malignancy, the main goal of treatment is to palliate and provide symptom relief (3). This has often been interpreted to support the use of the least intrusive intervention that is both\neffective and has minimal adverse effects. For several decades, management has focused on chemical pleurodesis using various agents such as doxycycline, talc, and bleomycin (1). However, pleurodesis fails within a few months in a substantial proportion of patients (4, 5). Pleurodesis generally requires inpatient hospitalization and when done using thoracoscopy, often necessitates the use of general anesthesia. Indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) have been successfully used for ongoing control of MPE, especially when survival of months to a few years is expected. The publication of several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing IPC with chemical pleurodesis has mandated a reassessment of existing evidence. As part of the American Thoracic Society (ATS) clinical practice guidelines for malignant pleural effusions, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the patient-centered outcomes with the use of tunneled pleural catheter versus chemical pleurodesis as the /uniFB01 rst-line treatment of MPE (6).",

At both stages, the reasons for exclusion were documented. Title/abstract screening was conducted by a single screener and checked by a second person. Full-text screening was conducted by two independent reviewers (M.M.W. and C.B.R.).

Studies that were included compared IPC (any make or brand) and chemical pleurodesis (with any chemical agent) delivered with bedside chest tube placement. For randomized trials, we chose only studies with direct comparison of the two interventions.\nFor each trial, study, patient, and treatment characteristics, and ef /uniFB01 cacy/ effectiveness/safety outcomes, were extracted. In particular for continuous variables, the appropriate estimate measures and dispersion (mean, median, SD, and range) were extracted. For dichotomous and categorical variables, the number and/or proportion of patients were extracted.

      "content": "Risk of bias (study quality) of included studies was assessed with the tool recommended by the Cochrane Statistical Methods Group and the Cochrane Methods Bias Group (7). In brief, this tool includes sequence generation (allocation bias), allocation sequence concealment (allocation bias), blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias), blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), selective outcome reporting (reporting bias), and other potential sources of bias. Each category was graded as high, low, or unclear risk of bias by two authors reviewing independently. The risk of bias is reported pictorially as a graph as there is no summary score for an overall risk of bias.\nQuantitative synthesis was performed with Review Manager (RevMan) software, version 5.3 (Nordic Cochrane Centre, Cochrane Collaboration, 2014). We did not pool RCT data with data from observational studies. In this way, the results may differ from other previously published metaanalyses that used different inclusion criteria or mixed RCT and non-RCT study data. For continuous measures where the SD was not reported in an included study, these were imputed using the methodology recommended by the Cochrane handbook (7). We used random effects modeling for\nthe meta-analysis. Randomized trials in MPE included small to medium-sized studies (50 -200 patients per study) with no single large study and with signi /uniFB01 cant but varying attrition of patients during followup. We, therefore, used the random effects model because it weights smaller studies more equally (7). Dichotomous outcomes were reported as relative risk (Relative risk (RR)) with 95% con /uniFB01 dence interval (CI), and continuous outcomes were reported as mean differences unless otherwise speci /uniFB01 ed. We performed subgroup analysis if an a priori subgroup strati /uniFB01 cation was described in individual studies. We measured heterogeneity using the I 2 statistic. When substantial heterogeneity was identi /uniFB01 ed, we explored possible causes and performed subgroup analysis where possible. Sensitivity analysis was performed when outcomes were not clearly reported in individual studies (e.g., the outcome ' infection ' could be interpreted as pleural infection or cellulitis).",

Of the studies identi /uniFB01 ed, /uniFB01 ve were RCTs (9 -13), four were retrospective observational studies (14 -17), and one was a prospective observational study (18). The /uniFB01 ve RCTs enrolling 545 patients were included in the quantitative synthesis. One RCT compared IPC with doxycycline pleurodesis, and four RCTs compared IPC with talc pleurodesis. A summary of characteristics of the randomized and nonrandomized studies is provided in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. Among the randomized studies, two each used PleurX (10, 12) and Rocket (9, 11) brand IPCs, whereas the /uniFB01 fth study did not specify the type of device (13). All trials were small, with the largest sample size being 144 patients. Patients had known malignant or highly suspicious\nexudative pleural effusions associated with an underlying cancer, most commonly breast or lung cancer, although mesothelioma comprised one-fourth of cases in one study (13). Investigators did not attempt to enroll patients with failed prior pleurodesis or known trapped lung, although some patients were found to have trapped lung after randomization and large-volume drainage. Improvement in dyspnea was the primary outcome in two studies (9, 11), and total hospital days were examined as the primary outcome in two other studies (12, 13). The last study examined recurrence of the pleural effusion, but this outcome was fairly subjective. Because a network meta-analysis showed no differences in the outcome of malignant pleural effusions managed with different chemical agents, we combined results for both talc and doxycycline for the meta-analysis (19).",

Pooled data from more than 500 patients across /uniFB01 ve different studies showed that IPCs were associated with shorter length of procedure-related hospital stay and lower risks of ipsilateral pleural interventions when compared with chemical pleurodesis; conversely, IPCs were associated with a higher risk of cellulitis. There were no differences in dyspnea or survival between the two therapies.\nMPE is generally considered to be a manifestation of a malignancy in its preterminal stage. The main goal of care is palliation of symptoms. In our metaanalysis, improvement of dyspnea was noted with both IPC and pleurodesis, and there was no difference between the two interventions for this outcome. However, there were fewer repeat pleural procedures with IPC than pleurodesis. Studies with longer follow-up (12 mo) showed a more marked difference in the need for repeat pleural procedures compared with studies with shorter follow-up (6 wk). In addition, spontaneous\nDefinition of abbreviations : AMPLE=Australasian Malignant Pleural Effusion; CALGB = Cancer and Leukemia Group B; IPC = indwelling pleural catheter; LOS=length of stay; NVALT-14 = Randomized Trial Comparing Longstanding Indwelling Pleural Catheters with Pleurodesis as a Frontline Treatment for Malignant Pleural Effusion; TIME2 = Second Therapeutic Intervention in Malignant Effusion Trial.\npleurodesis was seen in 30 -68% of patients in the IPC group. This clear bene /uniFB01 t in reduced need for repeat pleural procedures needs to be balanced against the statistically signi /uniFB01 cant increase in cellulitis and an accompanying trend toward an increased risk of pleural infection with the IPC. These data should inform the risk-versus-bene /uniFB01 t calculation of IPC as the /uniFB01 rst-line treatment of MPE.\nThe RCTs included patients with MPE who likely represent typical patients\nwith MPE, for whom clinicians need guidance regarding management. All cancer types were included and four of the /uniFB01 ve studies had at least some plan to balance the randomized groups on the basis of cancer type and performance status. The interventions tested in the randomized trials were well de /uniFB01 ned, and there was not much difference in the type of interventions between studies. Although for some individual outcomes the overall risk of bias was\nconsidered ' low risk, ' it is possible that the lack of blinding affected outcomes that relied on patient self-report or physician judgment. Data regarding the decreased need for further pleural interventions need to be taken with caution because of the unblinded nature of the studies. In many institutions, the same clinicians place both IPCs and tube thoracostomies; the investigators may have had a lower threshold of intervening in the chemical pleurodesis\ngroup, especially because several chemical pleurodesis patients underwent IPC placement as a form of further pleural intervention. Alternatively, investigators may have had a higher threshold for performing additional pleural interventions in patients who underwent IPC placement; rather than performing an additional pleural drainage, one study ' s authors reported readjusting the indwelling IPC in some patients (12). However, proponents of IPCs cite this ability to readjust in lieu of\nreplacing the catheter as one of its advantages over tube thoracostomy.\nThe results of the meta-analysis may be impacted by future, larger randomized trials. Most outcomes were reported in fewer than 300 patients. With attrition due to early death, longer term outcomes were reported in even fewer patients. Further, outcomes such as hospital LOS and need for repeat procedures are often in /uniFB02 uenced by local practices and resources. These outcomes are dif /uniFB01 cult to standardize and\nsubsequently pool in a meta-analysis. Similarly, the clinical importance of outcomes such as cellulitis and pleural infection (requiring administration of intravenous antibiotics on an outpatient basis) are likely to be different in different contexts. Patient preferences and the economic impact of the treatment options also need to be considered when choosing between IPC and pleurodesis. n\nAuthor disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org.",
