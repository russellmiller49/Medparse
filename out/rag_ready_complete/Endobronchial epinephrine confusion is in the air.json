    "abstract": "A literature review highlights wide variation in topical epinephrine dosing/dilution for bronchoscopic bleeding and the potential for arrhythmias even at low doses. The authors' pragmatic recommendations: try iced saline first; if epinephrine is used, monitor continuously, use small aliquots of 1:100,000 up to 0.6 mg total, switch early to tamponade/adjuncts if bleeding persists, consider norepinephrine to limit tachycardia, and avoid use in high-risk patients (coronary disease, arrhythmia, carcinoid). The accompanying reply underscores that peripheral instillation (e.g., via guide sheath during TBLB) may cause greater systemic absorption—epinephrine should not be instilled into distal airways; manage TBLB bleeding with iced saline and bronchoscopic tamponade, with major adverse events from TBLB bleeding being rare.

      "content": "To the Editor :\nWe read with interest the letter to the editor by Steinfort and colleagues (1). We performed an extensive search and discovered that the doses and dilutions of epinephrine suggested by textbooks, publications, and guidelines for management of airway bleeding during bronchoscopy vary widely from 'small amounts' of 1:100,000 solution up to 20 ml of 1:20,000 solution (Table 1). Topical endobronchial application of epinephrine causing cardiac arrhythmias is well recognized and caution about dosing has been recommended since the 1970s (2), as adverse cardiac events can occur at doses as low as 0.1 mg. Although newer textbooks of bronchoscopy recommend 10fold reduction in the dose of epinephrine for control of bleeding (3), variable effects of epinephrine have been observed. Endotracheal administration of epinephrine when intravenous access cannot be obtained during cardiopulmonary resuscitation is deleterious if small doses (0.5 m g/kg in normal saline to 10 ml volume) are used due to hypotension from b -adrenergic-induced peripheral vasodilatation that is unopposed by a -adrenergic vasoconstriction (4). A study of patients undergoing elective hip surgery compared hemodynamic effects of endotracheal versus intravenous epinephrine at 0.5 m g/kg dose. Patients who received endotracheal epinephrine experienced 10 mm Hg fall in blood pressure (5), which led to a call for larger doses, and research on canines has demonstrated that blood pressure increased when the recommended dose (0.03 mg/kg) was raised 10-fold (6). Moreover, the volume of diluents used can also produce different pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics despite administration of the same dose of epinephrine. In this interesting study, 1 mg epinephrine diluted in 10 ml of saline was instilled into the trachea of dogs, which resulted in higher mean plasma epinephrine concentrations as compared with diluting the same dose in 1 ml of saline, suggesting that higher diluents volume could have carried the epinephrine more effectively to pulmonary absorptive areas (7). These reports illustrate the unpredictable effects of epinephrine in the airways both from dose and diluent standpoints. We concur with the authors that endobronchial epinephrine should be employed with caution especially when continuous electrocardiographic monitoring is neither routinely available nor recommended\nfor patients undergoing bronchoscopy (8). The Cleveland Clinic practice over the past 32 years has been to use 2-ml aliquots of 1:10:000 epinephrine up to a maximum dose of 0.6 mg only when ice saline instillation fails, with continuous heart rate and blood pressure monitoring. Endobronchial administration of epinephrine is avoided in the elderly and in patients with arrhythmias and coronary artery disease as well as those with carcinoid tumors, because epinephrine may worsen the catecholamine response and precipitate coronary spasm. Rather than propose a moratorium on the use of epinephrine in postbronchoscopic lung biopsy bleeding, we submit our recommendations despite the lack of controlled trials:\n1. Consider ice-cold saline. Every bronchoscopy suite should be equipped with ice-cold saline as gentle instillation of 10- to 15-ml aliquots from a fully wedged bronchoscope has been described as an effective method to stop bleeding from bronchoscopic lung biopsy (9, 10).\n2. When epinephrine is required, mandatory electrocardiographic monitoring and prompt switch to other measures for hemostasis such as turning the patient to the lateral decubitus position and use of a tamponade balloon when a maximum epinephrine dose of 0.6 mg fails to stop the bleeding.\n3. Use lower concentration of epinephrine 1:100,000 and instill small (2-ml) aliquots up to a maximum dose of 0.6 mg.\n4. Consider norepinephrine instead of epinephrine to reduce the chronotropic effect.\n5. Avoid its use in high-risk patients with underlying coronary artery disease and arrhythmias as well as those with carcinoid tumors.",

      "title": "Reply",
      "content": "From the Authors :\nWe are grateful to Khoo and colleagues for their interest in our report, and for the thorough review of the variable pharmacologic response to endotracheal epinephrine, which highlights the 'unpredictable effects of epinephrine in the airways both from dose and diluent standpoints.' It is worth noting that our concern regarding bronchoscopic instillation of epinephrine was prompted by 'transbronchial' installation via the guide sheath. Pharmacologic studies in animal models indicate significantly higher systemic absorption of epinephrine when administered into peripheral airways compared with proximal tracheal administration (1). This, as well as evidence presented by Khoo and colleagues, indicates it is likely that systemic absorption of epinephrine from the alveolar space is significantly higher than from the proximal airways. It is therefore important to draw a distinction between endobronchial (central airway) bleeding and bleeding complicating transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB), which, even in patients on clopidogrel, may be controlled by endoscopic means without resorting to more invasive measures (2). Management of bleeding after TBLB with epinephrine would necessitate instillation into the distal airways/alveolar space where, on the basis of the above evidence, a higher risk of adverse sequelae of epinephrine administration could be anticipated.\nUse of any therapeutic measure should be undertaken after consideration of the risk-benefit equation. Regarding management of endobronchial (central airway) bleeding, we agree with the recommendations submitted by Khoo and colleagues. These recommendations may also be considered in management of bleeding post-TBLB; however, it is important to reiterate, as have Khoo and colleagues, that the contribution to hemostasis made by epinephrine in patients with severe bleeding after TBLB is unknown. It is also important to recall that major adverse sequelae of bleeding after TBLB are exceedingly rare (3-5). Our original report did not suggest a moratorium on use of epinephrine in postbronchoscopic lung biopsy bleeding, but did recommend that\nclinicians should remain cognizant of these issues (6). Given our reported experience (6), we remain of the opinion that epinephrine should never be administered into the lung periphery via the guide sheath. We no longer use epinephrine to control bleeding post-TBLB and would still suggest that failure to control bleeding post-TBLB using iced saline and bronchoscopic tamponade should simply be managed by ongoing iced saline and bronchoscopic tamponade.\nAuthor disclosures are available with the text of this letter at www.atsjournals.org.",
