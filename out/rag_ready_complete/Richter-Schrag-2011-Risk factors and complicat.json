Accepted October 12, 2010\nP ercutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) using the pull-through technique has become established in clinical practice for the maintenance of enteral feeding of patients with impaired swallowing and food passage  due  to  cancer,  neurological  conditions  or  other  diseases  (1). Serious coagulation impairments, ethical issues (eg, artificial nutrition) and  advanced  liver  cirrhosis  with  pronounced  ascites  are  recognized guideline-relevant contraindications for PEG (1). According to the recommendations of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, thrombocyte aggregation inhibitors such as acetylsalicylic acid or ticlopidine are relative contraindications for PEG, while anticoagulants such as  clopidogrel  and  phenprocoumon/warfarin  make  PEG  a  high-risk\nprocedure (2,3). Due to the present lack of data, a therapy pause of seven to 10 days (for patients on clopidogrel or ticlopidine) or three to five days (for patients on phenprocoumon) is recommended before the procedure.  Patients  taking  clopidogrel  and  acetylsalicylic  acid  should preferably be switched to acetylsalicylic acid monotherapy. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) should be withdrawn 4 h to 6 h before PEG.\nThe present study prospectively examined, among others, general and specific  post-PEG  bleeding  complications  in  patients  who  were concurrently  taking  and  not  taking  anticoagulants  or  antiplatelet drugs. It also determined whether the complications can be predicted by patients' general risk factors.",

OBJeCTiF : Évaluer les complications et les facteurs de risque de la GEP dans une grande série clinique incluant des patients subissant un traitement antiplaquettaire et anticoagulant.\nMÉTHOdOlOGie : Pendant  une  période  de  six  ans,  1  057  patients aiguillés en vue d'une GEP ont fait l'objet d'une vérification prospective de leurs résultats cliniques. Les auteurs ont défini les critères d'exclusion et les soins de suivi. Ils ont défini les complications comme mineures ou graves. Les analyses univariées et multivariées ont permis d'évaluer 14 facteurs de risque. Aucune prophylaxie antibiotique standardisée n'a été administrée.\nRÉSUlTATS  : Au  total,  1  041  patients  (66  %  d'hommes,  34  %  de femmes) ayant les troubles de santé suivants ont subi une GEP : dysphagie neurogène  (n=450),  cancer  (n=385)  et  autres  (n=206).  Trois  cent cinquante et un patients n'ont reçu aucuns anticoagulants, mais 348 ont reçu  une  prophylaxie  de  la  thrombose,  et  313,  une  anticoagulothérapie complète. Aucun risque de saignement accru ne s'associait à des patients dont les valeurs de ratio normalisées internationales se situaient au-dessus de  la  normale  (RRR  0,79  [95  %  IC  0,08  à  7,64];  P=1,00).  Le  taux d'infection total était de 20,5 % chez les patients ayant une maladie maligne et  de  5,5  % chez ceux ayant une maladie non maligne. On a constaté de graves complications chez 19 patients (hémorragie 0,5 %, péritonite 1,3 %). La cirrhose (RRR 2,91 [95 % IC 1,31 à 6,54]; P=0,008), le cancer (RRR 2,34 [95 % IC 1,33 à 4,12]; P=0,003) et la radiothérapie (RRR 2,34 [95 % IC 1,35 à 4,05]; P=0,002) étaient des prédicteurs significatifs d'infection après une GEP. Le taux de mortalité dans les 30 jours s'élevait à 5,8 %. Il n'y avait aucun décès lié à l'intervention.\nCOnClUSiOnS : Le cancer, la cirrhose et la radiothérapie étaient des prédicteurs  d'infection.  L'hémorragie  après  la  GEP  et  les  complications étaient rares. Collectivement, les données indiquaient que les patients qui prenaient des anticoagulants concomitants ne présentaient pas de risque élevé d'hémorragie après la GEP.",

Ambulatory PEG placements were not performed.\nThe following exclusion criteria were defined:\nA. Patients in whom no standard 'pull-through' technique with or without preceding Savary-Gilliard dilation (SG-dilation) was possible due to stenosis of the hypopharynx or esophagus.\nB.  Patients in whom PEG could not be performed without additional imaging (computed tomography).\nC.  Patients in whom PEG placement had to be terminated prematurely due to respiratory or other complications.\nD.  Missing written consent.\nIn  agreement  with  the  European  Society  of  Parenteral  and  Enteral Nutrition (ESPEN) guidelines (1), no standardized antibiotic prophylaxis was applied in the department. In stroke patients and patients on cardiosupportive apparatuses, thrombocyte aggregation inhibitors (eg, acetylsalicylic  acid  [Aspirin,  Bayer  Schering  Pharma,  Germany]  or  clopidogrel [Plavix,  Bristol-Myers Sanofi Pharmaceuticals Partnership, USA]) were generally not discontinued before PEG, nor was treatment with unfractionated  heparin  (UFH;  Liquemin,  Hoffmann-La  Roche  Pharma  AG, Germany).  Phenprocoumon  (Marcumar,  Hoffmann-La  Roche  AG, Germany)  was  also  not  defined  as  a  contraindication.  Ascites  were drained as much as possible during the PEG healing time (seven days).

After skin disinfection  of  the  left  upper  abdominal  quadrant  with  0.1  povidoneiodine solution (Braun Melsungen AG, Germany), PEG was performed using a one-hand technique - the examiner operated the endoscope with one hand while the skin incision and PEG penetration was made with the other.

The mean hospitalization time was 27.4 days (range one to 268 days).\nTable 3 summarizes the complications following PEG. The mean time to manifestation of peristomal infection was 6.7±10.4 days (range one to 90 days). The infection rate was 11.1% (95% CI 9.2% to 13.1% [20.5% in cancer patients  and  5.5%  in  patients  with  nonmalignant diseases]; P>0.001). Infection rates among patients undergoing antibiotic therapy at the time of PEG were not significantly different from those who were not (9.8% versus 12.1%; P=0.23). Simple infections were treated with four to five dry dressing changes daily or, alternatively,  with  a  hydrocellular  wound  dressing  (eg,  Allevyn,  Smith  & Nephew, USA). Additional deep cleaning of the peristomal wound was performed every three days.\nAn additional jejunal extension tube was positioned via the PEG in  44  patients  with  protracted  wound  infection  (peristomal  skin expansion greater than 10 mm). This measure improved drainage of gastric secretions, thereby circumventing gastric passage during enteral nutrition.  Eleven  patients  received  oral  antibiotic  therapy  with  a cephalosporin. The use of topical antibiotics is generally not undertaken in the department. The mean healing time of peristomal infections was 12.6±5.3 days (range five to 26 days).\nPeristomal bleeding (0.5% [95% CI 0.0% to 1.1%]) occurred after a mean of 8±4.5 days (range three to 14 days). There was no statistically significant difference between patients with or without anticoagulants,  or  in  those  with  an  increased  INR  (Table  1).  In  one  case, bleeding from the peristomal gastric wall was found intraoperatively, with an unknown cause of coagulopathy but normal INR. In another case, traumatic bleeding from the gastric wall occurred after accidental PEG dislocation. In a further case, fatal hemorrhage from esophageal varices occurred as an unrelated event. This patient died during hospitalization  from  bleeding  esophageal  varices,  which  could  not  be\ncontrolled. In one patient with an INR of 1.2, the bleeding could not be definitively localized endoscopically, but stopped spontaneously. In a  case  involving  an  18-month-old  child,  the  bleeding  stopped  after compression of the gastric wall via the pressure plate.\nPeritonitis  requiring  surgery  was  observed  in  14  patients  (1.3% [95% CI 0.7% to 2.3%]; mean 4.8±2.2 days [range two to nine days]). Seven operations were performed due to traumatic dislocation of the PEG by the patient (mean 7±1.9 days [range five to nine days]; nasooropharyngeal cancer (n=3), neurological diseases [n=4]). In another seven  cases  (naso-oropharyngeal  cancer  [n=4],  other  cancer  [n=1] and neurological disease [n=2]), a chemical peritonitis without PEG dislocation (3.6±1.96 days [range two to seven days]) was present. In one of these cases, the greater omentum was caught between the stomach and abdominal wall. Intraoperatively, no aberrant punctures of the large or small intestine were found. In the univariate analysis, seven of the 14 risk factors were associated with a significantly elevated complication rate. Independent risk factors determined in multivariate  analyses  could  only  be  evaluated  for  patients  with  PEG infections because of the insufficient number of events. A significantly elevated risk for post-PEG infection was found for patients with cancer or cirrhosis, and those with previous radiation exposure (Table 1).",

Significantly  more  patients  with  cancer  died  than patients  without  malignant  diseases  during  the  investigation  period (P<0.001).\nThe  PEG  had  been  permanently  removed  after  a  mean  of 6.7±8.8 months (range 0.2 to 54.4 months) in 303 of 1041 patients (26.6%  with  neurological  diseases,  18.3%  with  naso-oropharyngeal cancer, 20.8% with other cancer and 52.9% with nonmalignant nonneurological diseases) because the patient was able to eat. In cases of PEG tube leakage or greatly shortened, blocked or buried bumper, PEG replacement  was  necessary  after  a  mean  of  9.5±2.6  months  (range seven to 14 months).\nSurgical removal of the PEG was required in six patients with a buried bumper. No abdominal wall metastases were observed in patients with naso-oropharyngeal or other cancer during the observation period.\nData presented as n (%) unless otherwise indicated\nAfter discharge,  69.6% (672 of 965) of patients required out-ofhospital care (during the follow-up period, 46.9% of whom required slight  and  42.4%  intensive  care  [according  to  the  German  Grading System for necessity of nursing care grades II and III, respectively]). Neurological diseases were present in 184 of these patients, while 101 had noncancer diseases. Due to artificial enteral feeding, 17.7% (n=52) of patients reported diarrhea, and obstipation was seen in 12.6% (n=37). Transient vomiting and nausea was reported in 205 cases. In 61.9% of patients with neurological indications and 63.5% with other diseases, patients could maintain or even gain weight. This was possible, however, in only 35.4% of cancer patients.",

      "content": "Demographic trends show an increasing incidence of cardiovascular disease and cerebral ischemia. Therefore, it is not surprising that PEG placement using the pull/push and introducer methods has been established  as  the  standard  technique  for  enteral  nutrition  of  elderly patients with multiple comorbidities. Cerebrovascular diseases (18% to 35%), stroke, neurodegenerative and other neurological diseases (40.7% to 23%), as well as naso-oropharyngeal and other carcinomas (13.3% to 17%)  (5,6)  are  among  the  main  indications  for  PEG  in  the  United States and United Kingdom.\nIn our investigation, the in-hospital mortality and 30-day mortality rates were lower than those documented in several recent studies (7), in which mortality rates of between 15% and 32% were reported. This reflects  the  strict  indication  just  as  other  authors  suggest  (8,9). Otherwise, high long-term mortality of our patients is in agreement with  previously  reported  rates  of  between  33%  and  60%  (10-12). These studies  have  consistently  shown  that  cancer,  older  age  and  a high comorbitity index are risk factors for mortality after PEG.\nMost  of  our  patients  also  had  multiple  comorbidities,  and  more than  three-quarters  needed  help  -  at  least  temporarily  -  with  the application  of  artificial  enteral  feeding.  Approximately  30%  of  the patients did not tolerate artificial enteral feeding, which is comparable with previously reported data (10).\nSlightly less than 50% of our noncancer patients required intensive care and were generally cared for in nursing homes, which may be one reason for the long survival (13).\nOn one hand, patients with neurological issues, especially cerebrovascular disorders, often require therapeutic anticoagulation in the acute phase over a longer period of time. Moreover, they have a greater risk of aspiration, as our data showed. Coupled with the expected protracted reconvalescence, early PEG placement would thus appear justified. On the other hand, the long-term risk of bleeding complications in patients on combination therapy with anticoagulants is five- to 7.4-fold higher (14,15).\nThus,  the  international  consensus  suggests  to  discontinue  this therapy five to nine days before PEG placement or to switch to acetylsalicylic  acid  monotherapy  (2,3).  Nevertheless,  in  patients  with  high thromboembolic  risks,  such  as  serious  atrial  fibrillation,  mechanical heart  valve  prosthesis,  cerebrovascular  insufficiencies,  intracoronary or basilar stents, changing or stopping a treatment with anticoagulants could lead to life-threatening complications (16,17). Due to this and the present paucity of data regarding periprocedural bleeding risk, the recommended indications for PEG are often made very conservatively.\nThe present study was the first to examine post-PEG complications in patients concurrently on anticoagulants. Comparable with the literature, our data showed that post-PEG bleeding was, generally, a rare event (12). However, no reliable information regarding the increased incidence  of  various  PEG  complications  in  patients  with  increased INRs and treated with anticoagulants are available.\nOne limitation of the present study is its relatively low predictive power due to the low incidence of post-PEG bleeding and the observational design. If we assumed a bleeding risk of approximately 1.6% in  patients  with  PEG  without  anticoagulants,  the  necessary  sample size  would  be  2400  patients  per  group  (Fisher's  test  1b =0.80,  twosided significance level a =0.05). With lesser risks, the numbers grow\nexponentially.  However,  we  found  post-PEG  bleeding  complications uniformly distributed in all patients without any increased bleeding risk in  patients  taking  anticoagulants or with increased INR values. One possible  explanation may lie in the PEG technique itself. Compared with  other  endoscopic  high-risk  procedures  under  anticoagulation, such  as  polypectomy,  papillotomy  or  pancreaticogastrostomy,  PEG not only has a short operation time, but also the smallest wound area, which is additionally compressed by the internal bumper and the external fixation plate at the procedures end.\nThe infection rates of 5% in patients with nonmalignant diseases and 20% in those with malignant diseases are consistent with infection rates reported  in  other  studies.  Wound  infection  using  the  pull-through method occurs in 5% to 36% of patients, despite the use of prophylactic antibiotic therapy (18-21). Moreover, Zopf et al (22) found that postPEG infection is significantly associated with risk factors such as underlying malignant diseases, tube size, institutional factors and endoscopist experience.  Our  data  showed  that  cancer,  previous  radiation  exposure and cirrhosis should be considered as additional significant risk factors of post-PEG  infection.  Patients,  especially  those  with  cancer,  are  often negatively influenced by additional immunosuppressing factors such as radio-  or  chemotherapy,  or  diabetes  mellitus  (23).  In  addition  to increased vasoconstriction and damaged epithelium in the vascular wall, altered rheological properties of the blood and other hemodynamic influences due to cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, or alcohol and nicotine abuse, are important factors in the pathogenesis of impaired wound and anastomosis healing (24), and can increase the risk of infection separately or in combination (25,26). In the literature, different authors state that push methods such as percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (27,28), or later methods such as the bumper-button type (29), have advantages in obese patients, decrease rates of wound infection and exclude stomal metastases.  This  could  be  beneficial  for  patients,  especially  those  with  oropharyngeal cancer. On the other hand, limitations of PEG include the the  lack  of  possibility  of  diagnostic  endoscopic  examination  and  the higher risk for bleeding. In our experience, primarily in high-risk patients with  portal  hypertension  or  esophageal  or  gastric  varices,  only  an intraluminal diagnostic examination during the procedure could query the indication. Furthermore, in patients with esophageal obstruction, the tumour can also be passed with a 5 mm endoscope - if not, the stenosis can easily be dilated to 8 mm to 10 mm without a relevant risk. This means that in most cases, the classical PEG pull-through technique can be performed endoscopically or assisted by computed tomography.\nLower costs, the involvement of only one operator, the speed of the procedure and no radiation exposure are the advantages and the reasons why the pull-through method for PEG is used in our department.",

      "content": "The present  study  identified  three  risk  factors  that  predict  peristomal post-PEG infection: cancer, radiation exposure and cirrhosis. Taking this into consideration, our institution administers a single dose of antibiotic to patients at risk.\nDespite  the  limitations  of  the  present  study,  our  data  suggest that patients undergoing therapeutic anticoagulation or those with increased INR values have no elevated risk of bleeding during PEG placement. Therefore, in high-risk patients undergoing anticoagulation  therapy  or  those  with  abnormal  clotting,  we  neither  defer PEG placement nor do we reverse anticoagulation (eg, fresh frozen plasma). If urgent enteral feeding is necessary, we perform the procedure with the relevant anticoagulants.\nFurthermore, secondary complications such as difficulties in reestablishing warfarin or phenprocoumon therapy after overaggressive reversal with vitamin K before PEG placement can be avoided.\nEndoscopic examination and PEG placement in anticoagulated patients using a one-handed video-assisted or fiberoptic technique should, nonetheless, be performed only by experienced specialists. The  majority  of  complications  occur  within  the  first  week,  and daily clinical assessment by the endoscopist or a trained member of the team should be performed during the first eight days.",
