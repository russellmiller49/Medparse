The aims of this study were to investigate the diagnostic value of Endobronchial ultrasound (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)) elastography for distinguishing the difference between benign and malignant lymph nodes among mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes. Materials and Methods: From June 2015 to August 2015, 47 patients confirmed of mediastinal and hilar lymph node enlargement through examination of Computed tomography (CT) were enrolled, and a total of 78 lymph nodes were evaluated by endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA). Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided elastography of lymph nodes was performed prior to Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA. A convex probe Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) was used with a new Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) processor to assess elastographic patterns that were classified based on color distribution as follows: Type 1, predominantly non-blue (green, yellow and red); Type 2, part blue, part non-blue (green, yellow and red); Type 3, predominantly blue. Pathological determination of malignant or benign lymph nodes was used as the gold standard for this study. The elastographic patterns were compared with the final pathologic results from Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA. Results: On pathological evaluation of the lymph nodes, 45 were benign and 33 were malignant. The lymph nodes that were classified as Type 1 on endobronchial ultrasound elastography were benign in 26/27 (96.3%) and malignant in 1/27 (3.7%); for Type 2 lymph nodes, 15/20 (75.0%) were benign and 5/20 (25.0%) were malignant; Type 3 lymph nodes were benign in 4/31 (12.9%) and malignant in 27/31 (87.1%). In classifying Type 1 as 'benign' and Type 3 as 'malignant,' the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and diagnostic accuracy rates were 96.43%, 86.67%, 87.10%, 96.30%, 91.38%, respectively. Conclusion: Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography of mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes is a noninvasive technique that can be performed reliably and may be helpful in the prediction of benign and malignant lymph nodes among mediastinal and hilar lymph node during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA.

      "title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "content": "Recently, elastography, a new ultrasonographyassociated technology that measures tissue\ncompressibility,  was  introduced  in  the  market.  In principle, pathophysiological processes, such as malignancy,  make  tissues  less  deformable  or  stiff.\nCompression  of  surrounding  structures  produces  a deformity  or  strain  effect  that  is  inversely  related  to the  hardness  of  the  pathologic  tissue;  harder  tissues are less deformable than softer tissues. So ultrasound elastography  can  be  used  to  identify  benign  and malignant tissue through measuring tissue compressibility. There have been several reports suggesting that endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) elastography had a high sensitivity and specificity for detecting malignant involvement of LNs, breast and thyroid  disease [1-6] .  However,  the  role  of  ultrasound elastography in the diagnosis of mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes is still  unknown. In  our present  study we  aimed  to  investigate  the diagnostic value  of Endobronchial  ultrasound  (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS))  elastography  for distinguishing benign and malignant lymph nodes in the mediastinum.",

At least one enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy (short  axis  greater  than  1  cm)  was  observed  in  all patients on CT chest images.  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA  was performed  for  clinical  reasons  independent  of  the purposes of the study. Here, 47 patients confirmed of mediastinal and hilar lymph node enlargement through examination of Computed tomography (CT) were  enrolled,  and  a  total  of  78  lymph  nodes  were evaluated by endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial  needle  aspiration  (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA)  22G Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)  needle.  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided  elastography  of  lymph nodes was performed prior to Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA. We had collected 47 patients with mediastinal or hilar lymph node(s)  enlargement(s),  of  which  29  males  and  18 females,  aged  25-77,  with  an  average  age  of  60.19  ± 11.03.  All  patients  gave  written  informed  consent before the procedure. Institutional review board approval was granted for this retrospective review.",

      "content": "The patients should complete 6-8 hours of fasting,  routine  blood  test,  thin-slice  CT  scans  of lungs, and electrocardiogram before the examination, patients were placed under moderate to deep sedation,  which  was  preferred  for  the  patients  after evaluation of the anesthesiologist. Patient was given oropharyngeal anesthesia by oral inhalation of 2 ml of 2% lidocaine injection. Then, the patient was administered  inducing  dose  of  dexmedetomidine  (1\nμ g/kg)  via  micro  pump  of  superficial  vein  in  10-15 minutes.  After  that,  a  dose  of  0.5-0.7 μ g.kg -1 ·h -1  was given for maintenance. After falling asleep, the patients  were  administrated  midazolam  (0.03-0.05 mg.kg-1) and fentanyl (25-50 μ g) through slow intravenous push. If necessary, the dosage of midazolam and fentanyl could be increased as appropriate.  We  inserted  nasopharyngeal  tube  to keep the upper respiratory tract unobstructed. For the patients with contraindications, such as uncontrolled hypertension  and  arrhythmia,  local anesthesia of oropharyngeal  inhaled  aerosolized  lidocaine  should be only applied alternatively. The convex probe Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) (BF-UC260F,  Olympus,  Japan)  was  inserted  through the  nose  route,  with  intermittent  instillation  of  2  ml aliquot  doses  of  2%  lidocaine.  Elastography  was performed  on  all LNs  that were  candidates for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA.  The  elasticity of tissue within the scanned area was reconstructed by comparing it with the surrounding tissue, and translated this into a color signal  that  overlaid  the  B-mode  image.  The  colors associated  with  hard,  intermediate  and  soft  tissues were  blue,  green  and  yellow/red,  respectively.  The complete  spectrum  from  blue  to  red  encoding  was applied to each elastographic record and indicated the calibration  of  relative  elasticity  of  the  scanned  area. Elastographic and B-mode images were simultaneously displayed on the monitor side by side. After elastography evaluation, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA (NA-201SX-4022,  Olympus ® ,  Japan)  with negative pressure  was  done  for  20-30  times,  under  real-time Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)  guidance.  Histology  and  cytology  specimens were  collected  accordingly.  Rapid  on-site  cytology evaluation (ROSE) was performed for every case. The final  diagnosis  was  confirmed  from  independent pathological  examination  of  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA  specimens by pathologists who did not know the results of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography.",

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "content": "Recently, Endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial  needle  aspiration  (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA)  is  a widely  used  minimally  invasive  procedure  that  has been shown to have a high sensitivity and diagnostic yield  for  not  only  detecting  metastasis  to  hilar  and mediastinal  lymph  nodes  (LNs)  but  also  in  lung cancer staging and diagnosis [7,8] .  Though, there have been several reports suggesting that endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) elastography had a high sensitivity and specificity for detecting malignant involvement of LNs, breast and thyroid disease. Subsequently, elastography  has  become  available  for  use  during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) [9] .  As  of  yet,  evidence  is  needed  to  assess whether  elastography  can  be  a  valuable  tool  in  the noninvasive discrimination between benign and malignant Mediastinal and Hilar LNs during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA. This study found the utility of elastography  for  hilar  and  mediastinal  LNs  during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA.\nBased on our results, we propose a simple Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography classification that had been reported by Takehiro lzumo [10] . Type 1 (predominantly non-blue) indicates a benign pathology; Type 2 (part blue, part non-blue)  is  equivocal;  and  Type  3  (predominantly blue)  indicates  malignancy.  The  lymph  nodes  that were classified as Type 1 on endobronchial ultrasound elastography were normal lymph tissue in 16/27 (59.26%), granulomatous lesions lymphoid tissue in 10/27 (37.04%) and malignant in 1/27 (3.7%), so Type 1 lymph nodes could be stored temporarily in\nobservation if there is no obvious puncture indications because of high negative predictive value. For  Type  2  lymph  nodes,  we  found  normal  lymph\ntissue in 1/20 (5%), granulomatous lesions lymphoid tissue  in  14/20  (70%)  and  malignant  in  5/20  (25%). Though this lesion type shows higher NPV than PPV,\nit has a relevant malignancy rate.  We suggest  that  lymph  nodes  of  this  type  2 should  be  needled  in  any  case.  Type  3 lymph  nodes  have  the highest positive predictive  value  (87.1%)  and  mostly  are malignant  disease  based  on  pathological results.  For  Type  3  elastography  LNs,  the high positive predictive value could help in promptly deciding a  target  area  to  sample during  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA.  But  this  method  in estimating area percentage, easily influenced  by  subjective  factors,  therefore, will produce certain error. In 2015, Takahiro Nakajima etc. reported a new Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography classification method that can be more accurate in classification of lymph nodes through image J1.45 software calculating the pixel area and then acquire the radio of hard lymph node (blue) area to avoid  the  classification  error  due  to  the subjective factors effect in sonographic view of each object lymph node [11] . But, there still is  a  certain  error  of  the  judgment  of  the whole  lymph  node  hardness,  because  the software  calculation  area  is  only  for  one sonographic view of lymph node, the elastography classification  method  need to be further improved.\nAs one result  of  this  study  we  found false  positive  LNs  in  the  Type  3  group classified histologically as sarcoidosis [Figure 2], due to fibrous tissue hyperplasia in  lymphoid  tissue  leading  to  increased hardness. For false negative patients in type 1  lymph  nodes,  the  final  pathologic  result was adenocarcinoma [Figure 3], because the lymph node invasion by tumor cells caused partial lymphoid tissue liquefaction. Due to the above-mentioned reasons, operators should  combine  clinical  examination  with patients  medical  history  in  order  to  avoid misdiagnosis. There are two groups of patients;  one  is  tuberculosis  patients,  with caseous  necrosis and  more  calcifications which increase  organization  hardness.  The second  is  chronic  lymphadenitis  patients: Here the tissue hardens by increased fibrous tissue hyperplasia. In these 2 groups the operator should  pay  high attention during  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)  elastography  examination  of superficial lymph nodes.\nA\nB",

      "title": "CONCLUSION",
      "content": "In  2010,  Taiki  Fujiwara  had  studied  the  benign and malignant mediastinal lymph nodes in six aspects, such as size, shape, boundary, echo of lymph nodes,  hilus  and  coagulation  necrosis [12] .  In  2012, Takahiro Nakajima etc. had studied the relationship of blood supply between  benign  and  malignant lymph  nodes [13] .  The  final  results  indicated  that  the sensitivity  is  not  ideal.  By  ultrasonic  bronchoscopy elastography in the lung and mediastinal lymph node, the application of the study found that the sensitivity and specificity between benign and malignant diagnosis  when  compared  with  the  previous  two methods is improved greatly and provides us with a new diagnostic tool.\nIn  order  to  provide  better  guidance  for  clinical doctors,  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)  elastography  classification  of  lymph nodes  still  needs  further  exploration,  development\nand improvement as it lacks of unified standards. So on  the  basis  of  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)  elastography  classification  of lymph  nodes,  we  should  further  combine  patients history and clinical examination in order to interpret correctly the pathological results. In addition with the increasing  development  of  technology,  we  believe that Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography will be more and more used in the everyday practice and will play a basic role in the  diagnostic  approach  of  benign  and  malignant mediastinal lymph nodes [14] .",
