Approximately 1.5 million people develop pleural effusions each year in the United States (1).\nPleural infections have been associated with increased mortality, morbidity, and increased hospital costs (2 -4). Around 90,000 hospital admissions each year in the United States are due to pleural infection,\nwith an overall mortality approaching 10 -20%. Pleural infection is found commonly in elderly patients and those with comorbidities that are often not suitable for surgical management (2 -4).\nTreatment of complicated parapneumonic effusion (CPPE) or empyema requires antibiotics and drainage of the pleural cavity (3). However, in about 30% of patients with pleural infection, /uniFB02 uid is dif /uniFB01 cult to drain due to loculations, septations, and increased viscosity of the pleural /uniFB02 uid (5, 6). The intrapleural therapy of combined tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and human recombinant DNase (DNase) in the management of pleural infection has been shown to improve drainage of infected effusion, reduce the need for surgical intervention (6), and decrease the length of hospital stay (6, 7).\nThe optimal administration (concurrent or sequential) and duration of intrapleural therapy remains unclear. In two previous trials, sequential tPA (10 mg) and DNase (5 mg) were instilled intrapleurally twice daily up to a maximum of six doses over 3 days (6, 7). Following each medication, chest tube was clamped for up to 60 minutes to allow drugs to remain in the pleural space. However, in one study, about 28% (30 of 107) of patients received concurrent administration of drugs intrapleurally, and up to 16% of patients required fewer than six doses of combined therapy to have complete drainage of effusion (7). The aim of this study was to assess, on the basis of pleural /uniFB02 uid drainage, clinical response, and radiographic /uniFB01 ndings, the safety and ef /uniFB01 cacy of concurrent intrapleural instillations of tPA and DNase immediately after each other (hereafter referred to as concurrent ) instead of separately with an interval of 1 -2 hours in a large cohort of patients with CPPE or empyema.",

The study was approved by the institutional review board for data collection and analysis of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (IRB 2015P000034) with waiver of consent. Consecutive patients received concurrent intrapleural tPA/DNase therapy for pleural infection between January 2010 and October 2015.\nPleural infection included either CPPE or empyema. CPPE was de /uniFB01 ned as nonpurulent effusions in a patient with clinical evidence of infection, such as fever and/or elevated blood leukocyte count, with pleural /uniFB02 uid pH less than or equal to\n7.2 (measured using a blood gas analyzer), pleural /uniFB02 uid glucose less than 60 mg/dl, pleural /uniFB02 uid lactate dehydrogenase greater than 1,000 IU/L, and/or radiographic characteristics (loculations) (6 -8). Empyema was de /uniFB01 ned as pus within the pleural space and/or presence of bacteria on the basis of pleural /uniFB02 uid Gram staining or culture (6 -8). With ultrasonographic guidance, a chest tube was inserted into the most dependent area of the pleural effusion or into the largest loculation in patients with multiloculated effusions.\nFollowing chest tube insertion, the attending physicians (A.M. and E.F.) determined the suitability and timing of intrapleural tPA/DNase therapy on the basis of pleural /uniFB02 uid drainage ( , 200 ml within 24 h) and radiographic evidence of septations on chest ultrasound (US) or low-dose chest computed tomography (CT) (9). Complex, loculated pleural effusion\nvisualized by US was de /uniFB01 ned as /uniFB01 brin strands or septa /uniFB02 oating inside the anechoic/hypoechoic pleural effusions along with presence of de /uniFB01 ned multiple pockets in the pleural cavity (10). For chest CT, pleural effusion was de /uniFB01 ned as loculated if it ( 1 ) had a lobulated shape with a convex border or ( 2 ) was compartmentalized and accumulated in a /uniFB01 ssure or a nondependent portion of the pleura (11). Chest US was performed on all patients at the time of initial insertion of a chest tube for drainage as well as before and after each administration of intrapleural /uniFB01 brinolytic therapy. In addition, all patients with dry tap or /uniFB02 uid drainage less than 200 ml in 24 hours underwent low-dose chest CT 24 -48 hours before and 48 -72 hours after concurrent tPA/DNase therapy to ensure adequate chest tube placement, evaluate multiloculated collection, and assess therapy response (Figure 1).\nThe dose of DNase (Pulmozyme; Genentech, South San Francisco, CA) was 5 mg, and the dose of tPA (Actilyse; Genentech) was 10 mg, each in 50 ml of 0.9% NaCl. tPA and DNase were not mixed together in one syringe. Concurrent tPA and DNase were administered intrapleurally through the chest tube, followed by a 60-ml saline /uniFB02 ush. The tube was then clamped for 120 minutes before the chest tube was opened to 2 20 cm H2O of wall suction. Therapy was given twice daily for a maximum of six doses. Hospital records were reviewed for patient demographics, comorbidities, laboratory data (blood leukocyte count, pleural /uniFB02 uid biochemistry, and microbiologic cultures), medications (antibiotics and anticoagulation therapy), intrapleural therapy (frequency and timing), number of chest tubes, size of chest tube, chest tube days, and days of hospital stay.\nThe area of pleural opacity was quanti /uniFB01 ed by creating three-dimensional reconstructions of pleural effusions using patients ' low-dose chest computed tomographic scans with the OsiriX digital analysis program (OsiriX Imaging Software, v3.6.1; OsiriX Foundation, Geneva, Switzerland). The area of pleural effusion was delineated on each 5-mm scan. The software was then used to calculate pleural effusion volume in milliliters (1 ml = 1 cm 3 ) before and after tPA/DNase treatment (Figure 2).\nClinical outcome data collected included the following:\n1. Treatment outcomes:\na. Treatment success, de /uniFB01 ned as clinical (normalization of blood white blood cell count and defervescence) and radiological improvement without the need for surgical intervention\nb. Adverse events, including pleural bleeding (de /uniFB01 ned as drop in serum hematocrit requiring blood transfusion or causing hemodynamic instability) and signi /uniFB01 cant pain requiring escalation of analgesia\nc. Change in the area of pleural opacity pre- and post-treatment determined by low-dose chest CT\nd. Need for surgical interventions\n2. Other outcomes\na. Death related to pleural infection\nb. Cumulative volume of pleural /uniFB02 uid drained 24 hours before and 72 hours after concurrent tPA/DNase therapy\nc. Length of hospital stay (total and from /uniFB01 rst dose of tPA/DNase to hospital discharge)\nd. Duration of chest tube in pleural cavity (total and from insertion to /uniFB01 rst dose of tPA/DNase)\ne. Number of /uniFB01 brinolytic therapies needed\nf. Number and size of chest tubes\nStatistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 21 software (IBM, Armonk, NY). A P value less than 0.05 was de /uniFB01 ned as signi /uniFB01 cant. Results were\nexpressed as mean (SD) if normally distributed and otherwise as median (interquartile range [IQR]). The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare pleural /uniFB02 uid drainage and volume of pleural effusion visualized by chest CT before and after concurrent tPA/DNase treatment.",

      "title": "Discussion",
      "content": "In patients with CPPE and empyema, there is an intense in /uniFB02 ammatory response causing cytokine release and stimulating plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, leading to a pro /uniFB01 brotic state, /uniFB01 brin deposition, and eventually loculations (12, 13). Also, there is an increased viscosity of pleural /uniFB02 uid caused by high levels of deoxyribonucleoprotein along with DNA from leukocyte degradation (14). An oversimpli /uniFB01 ed theory is that DNase decreases /uniFB02 uid viscosity, while tPA breaks down loculations within the pleural space and induces large volumes of pleural /uniFB02 uid (15, 16).\nAlthough the mechanism of action of tPA/DNase on the cellular and molecular levels has not yet been well established, the synergistic effect, safety, and ef /uniFB01 cacy of sequential intrapleural therapy with an interval of 1 -2 hours between instillation of the two drugs in patients with pleural infection is evident on the basis of an animal model of empyema and two recent\nclinical trials (6, 7, 15). The optimal dosages, frequency, timing, and combination (concurrent or sequential) of intrapleural therapy are still not established. In the Multicenter Intrapleural Sepsis Trial (MIST2), therapy was given sequentially at the time of diagnosis of pleural infection, whereas researchers in another recent study administered intrapleural therapy sequentially after conventional treatment with antibiotics and drainage had failed (6, 7).\nThe use of concurrent rather than sequential therapy is quite appealing. Concurrent tPA/DNase treatment is less cumbersome for the medical team, nurses, and patients because it ( 1 ) decreases the need to access a chest tube to two times per day (maximum of 6 times in 3 d) as compared with four times per day (maximum of 12 times in 3 d) in sequential treatment, ( 2 ) shortens the treatment time from 3 hours to 2 hours per instillation, and ( 3 ) and makes protocol easier to implement in a twice-per-day\ndelivery regimen. In our study, we used a concurrent tPA/DNase therapy for patients with pleural infections that had an overall treatment success rate of 90.4%, which is comparable to that in the study by Piccolo and colleagues (92.3%) (7). It should be emphasized that around 71% of our patients received concurrent tPA/DNase therapy within 24 hours (early in the disease course), as compared with the patients in the study by Piccolo and colleagues, who received treatment after 24 hours (7). This might explain why patients in our present study required a median of only two doses of tPA/DNase, as compared with the other study (7), where the majority of patients required six doses of treatment. The results of another recent study, by Mehta and colleagues, con /uniFB01 rm our study /uniFB01 ndings. In that study, 92% of patients who received once-daily intrapleural sequential tPA/DNase for 3 days were successfully treated without the need for surgical intervention (17).\nFurthermore, our decision to start and guide /uniFB01 brinolytic therapy was based upon clinical as well as radiographic (pleural US or low-dose chest CT) evidence rather than being initiated upon admission or as a rescue therapy (6, 7). This translated to a shorter median hospital stay from the /uniFB01 rst dose of intrapleural treatment (7 d) than that (10 d) reported by Piccolo and colleagues, as well as a better treatment success rate (80.8% vs. 16%) in patients\nreceiving fewer than six doses of intrapleural therapy (7). Also, the average cost of six doses of combined therapy (10 mg of tPA and 5 mg of DNase) is around $6,840 (18, 19). Given the high cost of tPA/DNase, it might be feasible to guide the timing and number of doses on the basis of clinical and radiographic response, leading to a decreased number of doses and less cost. In our study, the median number of /uniFB01 brinolytic therapies was two, translating to an approximate cost of $2,280.\nThe role and timing of surgical intervention in patients with pleural infection remains to be established. In a recent study, researchers advocated the role of early video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) for drainage and decortications de /uniFB01 ned as less than 4 weeks from symptom duration (19). However, most patients who underwent VATS were relatively young and had a low comorbidity index; therefore, the elderly population with multiple comorbidities was excluded (20, 21). The mean age of patients undergoing surgical intervention in our study was 56.4 years (overall mean age, 59.3 yr), con /uniFB01 rming the above-mentioned studies (20, 21). In our study, around 9.6% of patients were referred for surgical intervention, as compared with 4% and 7.5% in two of the previous studies (6, 7). A probable explanation is that we guided our therapy on the basis of radiographic evidence (pleural US and/or chest CT rather than\nchest radiography before and after instillation of therapy) along with clinical response. Furthermore, a thoracic surgical team with great VATS expertise was readily available, and, per institutional protocol, residual pockets of more than 200 ml visualized by chest CT or US without clinical response are often drained using VATS. This could potentially lead to bias in surgical referral, since chest CT and pleural US are more effective than chest radiography for detection of loculations (22).\nThe instillation of concurrent rather than sequential tPA/DNase therapy was relatively safe and did not adversely increase the complication rate in such a sick population. The rate of bleeding requiring transfusion was 5.4%, which compares very favorably with that in the MIST2 trial\n(6%) but is higher than the rate reported in the study by Piccolo and colleagues (1.8%) (6, 7). A possible explanation is that 91.8% of our patient population had associated medical comorbidities, as compared with 76.6% in the Piccolo and colleagues study (7). Also, 15.1% of our patients had pain requiring analgesia during intrapleural therapy, as compared with 19.1% of patients in the other study (7). Contraindications to intrapleural tPA/DNase therapy have not been well established. Coagulopathy (such as in patients with chronic kidney disease, liver cirrhosis with coagulopathy, concurrent anticoagulation therapy, recent major hemorrhage), allergy or hypersensitivity to tPA, and/or presence of bronchopleural /uniFB01 stulas are the commonest contraindications (23, 24).\nOur study adds to the growing literature about the safety and ef /uniFB01 cacy of /uniFB01 brinolytic therapy in patients with pleural infections. Moreover, to our knowledge, our cohort represents the largest group of patients treated with concurrent tPA/DNase therapy. The data derived from the present study might suggest that such a therapy, guided by radiological imaging along with clinical response, is effective and might help clinicians decide about initiation of /uniFB01 brinolytic therapy. In addition, it might decrease the number of dosages needed and shorten hospital stay in such a sick population, leading to an overall lower cost.\nThis study has limitations. It was a retrospective cohort study done at a single institution without a study arm, leading to potential selection bias. Also, there were no prede /uniFB01 ned criteria about when to proceed with surgical intervention, which was decided upon at the physician ' s discretion. Future prospective comparative studies are needed to evaluate optimal administration of tPA/DNase treatment, dosages needed, and timing of therapy initiation.\nIn conclusion, early administration of concurrent intrapleural tPA/DNase therapy in patients with CPPE and empyema guided by clinical and radiographic response is relatively safe and effective. This could lead to fewer dosages, reduced hospital stay, and decreased overall cost. n\nAuthor disclosures are available with the text of this article at www.atsjournals.org.\nAcknowledgment: The authors thank Drs.
