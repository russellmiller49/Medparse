      "content": "Lung cancer is one of the most common diagnosed malignant  tumors  and  the  leading  cause  of  cancerrelated deaths worldwide, with a dismal 5-year survival rate  of  only  16%  [1].  Optimal  treatment  strategies  for patients  with  this  malignance  rely  on  accurate  staging and  diagnosis.  For  the  majority  of  patients  who  are diagnosed at advanced stage, systematic chemotherapy has been the only treatment choice for a long time [2]. In recent years, the presence of epidermal growth factor receptor  ( EGFR )  activating  mutations  and  anaplastic\nlymphoma kinase  ( ALK )  chromosomic  rearrangements with corresponding tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has revolutionized  the  treatment  strategies  of  patients  with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)) [3, 4]. It is noteworthy that precise molecular testing for genetic alterations needs adequate specimens. For these inoperable patients, endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA) has been demonstrated to be a minimally invasive technique for mediastinal node sampling and Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA specimens show high clinical utility for molecular testing, including EGFR mutations, KRAS mutations and ALK rearrangements [5-12].\nClinical Research Paper\nOn  the other hand,  mediastinal  lymph  nodes staging  is  essential  for  treatment  choices  for  patients without  distant  metastases.  Cervical  mediastinoscopy is  the  'golden  standard'  for  mediastinal  nodal  staging but  this  procedure  is  time-consuming  and  may  cause serious  complications  [13].  As  a  minimally  invasive technique, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA has revealed satisfied diagnostic yield  for  mediastinal  nodal  staging  as  compared  with mediastinoscopy [14, 15]. However,  the diagnostic accuracy  of  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA  depends  on  the  appropriate selection  of  lymph  nodes,  thus,  it  is  still  crucial  to identify  the  potentially  malignant  lymph  nodes  when performing EUBS-TBNA to reduce unnecessary biopsies. Our previous study has identified several sonographical ultrasonic features that are associated with the malignance of  lymph  nodes  but  with  varying  diagnostic  accuracy ranging from 40% to 80% [16], including round shape, distinct margin, heterogeneous echogenicity, presence of coagulation necrosis sign and so on.\nUltrasound elastography is a novel sonographical technique that can evaluate tissue compressibility [17]. In brief, softer tissues deform easier under compression than  harder  tissues  do  and  neoplastic  infiltration  may alter  the  elasticity  of  tissues  and  make  the  infiltrated tissue  stiffer.  Hence,  this  technique  has  potential  to distinguish malignant lymph nodes from benign ones. To investigate the diagnostic yield of ultrasound elastography for  differentiating  malignant  and  benign  mediastinal lymph nodes, we prospectively analyzed the features of\nultrasound elastography in 60 patients with 133 lymph nodes  who  underwent  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA  examination  in Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital from 1 May 2015 and 31 May 2015.",

      "title": "Diagnostic efficacy of EBUS B-mode features and elastography",
      "content": "The diagnostic efficacies of the six Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) B-mode features  and  elastography,  including  the  area  under the  curves  (AUCs)  with  95%  confidence  interval  (CI), sensitivity,  specificity,  positive  predictive  value  (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and diagnosis accuracy in the diagnosis of malignant lymph nodes are shown in Table 1. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis shows that elastography, heterogeneity, shape and border margin are positive criteria in the detection of malignant lymph nodes (Table 1).\nAmong the investigated ultrasonic criteria, elastography displayed the highest AUC (type 3 versus type  1:  AUC,  0.825;  95%  CI,  0.707-0.910)  with  an impressive sensitivity (100%) and an acceptable specificity (65%). The PPV, NPV and diagnosis accuracy were 0,857, 1.000 and 0.887, respectively. Consistent with our previous study [16], echogenicity heterogeneity also showed a good diagnostic  efficacy  in  distinguishing  malignant  lymph nodes, with a moderate AUC of 0.665, a high sensitivity\nof 0.876 and a moderate specificity of 0.591. Short axis and shape as discriminators showed a diagnosis accuracy of 0.737 and 0.669, indicating a high sensitivity (0.876 and 0.798, respectively) but low specificity (0.455 and 0.409, respectively). Meanwhile, for the variates central hilar structure with central blood vessel (CHS-CBV) and coagulation  necrosis,  the  specificity  is  low  (0.281  and 0.326, respectively), companying with a low diagnosis accuracy (0.406 and 0.489, respectively). Table 2 reveals the  correlation  between  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)  elastography  types  and ultrasonic  criteria  of  B-mode  features.  Notably,  when the investigated lymph nodes presented as elastography type 2 or type 3 and any other B-mode features, including short  axis  >  10mm,  round  shape,  distinct  margin  and heterogeneous echogenicity, the risk of malignance is over 70% (Table 2).\nIn  order  to  improve  the  diagnostic  efficacy  of positive  criteria  in  the  detection  of  malignant  lymph nodes, we investigated a model of grading scores where the number of positive criteria is counted (elastography, heterogeneity,  size,  and  shape)  (Figure  2).  Figure  2A shows number of patients with accordant number of the current six conventional Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) B-mode features. When\nAbbreviations: AUC, area under curve; CI, confidence interval; PPV, positive predictive value; NPV, negative predictive value; CHS, central hilar structure.\nindicating grading score of 3-6 as 'high risk' and 1-2 as 'low risk', the odds ratio (Odds ratio (OR)) for malignance is 5.99 with a 95% CI of 2.09 to 17.19 ( p < 0.0001). Figure 2B shows number of patients with accordant number of only positive ultrasonic criteria including elastography. Similarly, when indicating grading score of 3-4 as 'high risk' and 1-2 as 'low risk', the Odds ratio (OR) for malignance is 9.44 with a 95% CI of 3.99 to 22.32 ( p < 0.0001), suggesting that the presence\nof more than two positive criteria indicates malignancy of a lymph node and the model only including positive criteria is simple and adequate in distinguishing malignant lymph nodes. Further ROC analysis demonstrated that the combined model covering the four positive criteria is superior to elastography alone (AUC, 0.851; sensitivity, 89.89%; specificity, 72.73%; p < 0.0001) (Figure 3).",

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "content": "At present, National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) suggests mediastinoscopy or EBUSTBNA as recommended procedures  for  the  evaluation of  mediastinal  lymph  nodes  for  patients  with  lung cancer who are candidates for surgery [18]. Additionally, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA is also presented as a minimally invasive technique  for  the  accurate  diagnosis  of  patients  with lung cancer [14, 15]. Although Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA reveals a high specificity and PPV for the diagnosis of malignant lymph  nodes  [14],  the diagnostic accuracy  of this procedure depends on the accurate selection of targeted lymph  nodes.  Conventionally,  the  selection  of  target lesions  during  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA  is  based  on  insensitive size and morphologic criteria [16], such as size, shape, border  distinction,  echogenicity,  central  hilar  structure and coagulation necrosis, thus, lacking desired accuracy for  differentiating  malignant  and  benign  lymph  nodes. PET shows promising clinical utility but still has some limitations for classifying small nodal metastases [19]. In contrast, ultrasound elastography, designed to evaluate the stiffness of target tissues, has been established as a novel  sonographical  technique  for  the  characterizing lymph nodes. Previous meta-analysis has demonstrated that Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography display a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 85% in differentiating malignant and benign lymph nodes [20]. To date, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography has been proved to be a useful tool for the diagnosis and assessment\nof breast cancer [21], thyroid nodules [22], prostate cancer [23], and esophagogastric cancer staging et al. [24].\nInterestingly,  previous  studies  also  evaluated  the clinical utility of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography for the diagnosis of mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes [25-28]. In the study by Izumo et al. [25], qualitative elastographic pattern analysis showed that in 75 evaluated lymph nodes, the sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and diagnostic accuracy rates were 100%, 92.3%, 94.6%, 100% and 96.7%, respectively for malignance prediction. A recent study by Rozman et al. assessed the diagnostic value of elastography strain ratio of  mediastinal  lymph  nodes  in  patients  with  suspicion of  lung  cancer  [26].  In  32  patients  with  80  suspicious mediastinal lymph nodes, the diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for differentiating malignant and benign lymph nodes were 86.25%, 88.24%, 84.78%, 81.08%, and 90.70%, respectively. Consistent with the findings from above studies, our study including 60 patients with 133 evaluated lymph nodes, the largest sample  size  to  our  knowledge,  also  demonstrated  the significantly  clinical  utility  of  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)  elastography  for classifying suspicious mediastinal lymph nodes. Our study proved Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography as a non-invasive and reliable method that adds complementary information to current conventional  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)  imaging  and  help  differentiating benign and malignant lymph nodes.\nThe high diagnostic accuracy (88.7%), PPV (85.7%), and NPV (100%) of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography in our study has two aspects of clinical implications. For patients\nwith lung cancer who are candidates for surgery, if the evaluated lymph nodes imaging present as elastography Type 3, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA should be performed even the short axis is less than 10mm or presenting with other benign signs. In case of negative-TBNA or in situations where the puncture is not available, cautions should be taken when patients with Type 3 lymph nodes and other methods such as PET should be used to help characterizing the evaluated lymph nodes. On the other hand, for patients with inoperable and advanced lung cancer, duo to the high NPV, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA should be performed to in Type 3 lymph nodes to reduce unnecessary damage and shorten the  duration  of  procedures.  Additionally,  elastography can also help to guide the puncture area in a non-necrotic part of the suspicious lymph nodes (blue area) to improve diagnostic accuracy and specimen quality for diagnosis or further molecular testing.\nIn the present study, we also evaluated the diagnostic value of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) B-mode features for mediastinal lymph nodes  as  compared  with  elastography.  In  concordance with  our  previous  study  [16],  heterogeneity,  size  and shape also showed a relatively good diagnostic accuracy ( > 60%) for the diagnosis of lymph nodes, except for CHSCBV and coagulation necrosis. Although the specificity in our study is lower than that in previous studies [2528]  (Supplementary  Table  1),  the  PPV  is  comparable. Furthermore,  the  sensitivity  and  NPV  is  100%  in  our study, which is higher than previous studies except for the study by Izumo et al [25]. In order to improve the diagnostic efficacy, we introduced a grading score model of  the  four  positive  criteria  to  assess  lymph  nodes.  In this model, if the evaluated lymph nodes met all the four positive criteria, all of the 23 lymph nodes were malignant. The model suggested that the presence of more than two positive criteria indicates an OR for malignancy is as high as 9.44 and the model only including the four positive criteria is simple and adequate in distinguishing malignant lymph  nodes.  Further  ROC  analysis  of  the  combined model can improve the specificity from 65% to 72.7%.\nSeveral  limitations  should  be  mentioned  in  the present study. First, the sample size was still limited and relatively small. Second, previous studies suggested that strain ratio of elastography may be an objective indicator for  the  classification  of  lymph  nodes  [26,  27].  The diagnostic value of strain ratio needs to be evaluated in our center. However, the strain ratio was determined from 'frozen' Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) images, selection bias cannot be ignored when selecting reference area. The dynamic evaluation of region of interest may have some advantages. Finally, although the elastography data was collected prospectively and the movies of elastography and pathological results were blinded to raters in our study, prospective and multicenter  trials  are  needed  to  confirm  the  findings  in  the future.\nIn  conclusion,  this  prospective  study  showed  a significantly clinical utility of elastography for classifying\nsuspicious  mediastinal  lymph  nodes  with  a  high  PPV, NPV and diagnostic accuracy. Our study also showed that the  diagnostic  yield  will  be  improved  when  combined Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) elastography with the current conventional Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) imaging, such as heterogeneity, size, and shape.",

Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) procedures were performed with a convex probe Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) (BF-UC260FOL8; Olympus, Tokyo,  Japan,  7.5  MHz)  and  the  ultrasound processor EU-C2000 (Olympus). After local anesthesia to the pharynx with 4% lidocaine spray (10ml), the convex probe Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) was inserted through the nasal cavity or oral route, with intermittent instillation of 2% lidocaine (2-4ml per time).\nReal-time Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) B-mode and elastography were  recorded  as  digital  movies  prospectively.  Strain elastography was used to evaluate lymph nodes in our study. Ultrasonic criteria of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) B-mode and vascular pattern  on  power  Doppler  included  size,  shape,  border distinction,  echogenicity,  CHS-CBV  and  coagulation necrosis, sighs that have been previously demonstrated to  predict  malignancy  or  benign  mediastinal  lymph nodes [16]. After recording the movies of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) B-mode ultrasound criteria, the procedure was  switched to strain elastography mode and all lymph nodes that were candidates  for  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA  were  evaluated  by  strain elastography.  The  elastography  image  was  generated by vascular pulsations and respiratory movement as the result of tissue compression. After comparing the scanned area  with  the  surrounding  normal  tissue,  elastography images  were  reconstructed  and  translated  into  a  color signal  that  was  overlaid  on  the  B-mode  image.  Blue was indicated to represent hard tissue; otherwise, green\nand yellow/red were indicated to represent mediate, soft tissue,  respectively.  Based  on  the  dominant  colors  and their distributions in the target lymph nodes, elastographic patterns were  classified into 3 types as  previously described and shown in Figure 4 [25]: Type 1 (Figure 4A), dominant colors were green, yellow or red; Type 2 (Figure 4B), part blue, part green, yellow or red; Type 3 (Figure 4C), dominant color was blue.\nAfter non-invasive evaluation, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was performed  using  a  22-gauge  needle  (NA-201SX-4022; Olympus).  The  puncture  with  negative  pressure  was performed for about 10-20 passes a time, and 3 aspirations per lymph node under the guidance of real-time Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS). The  aspirated  material  was  smeared  onto  glass  slides, afterwards were air-dried for immediate evaluation by an on-site cytopathologist to confirm adequate cell materials. Additional  aspirated  materials  were  collected  in  liquid formalin for further pathological evaluation or molecular testing. The cytological analysis was afterwards performed by an experienced pathologist who was blinded to Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) B-mode features and elastography types.\nTwo  raters  (F.Z,  S.R)  evaluated  independently the  blinded  movies  of  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)  B-mode  features  and elastography (baseline characteristics and final pathological  results  of  evaluated  patients  were  blinded to the two raters).
