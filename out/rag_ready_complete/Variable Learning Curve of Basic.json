      "title": "Introduction",
      "content": "Rigid bronchoscopy (RB) has seen an increased role in the management of malignant and nonmalignant central airway disorders [1, 2]. The rigid bronchoscope is a surgical  instrument  which  can  perform  debulking,  dilation, hemostasis, and other therapeutic functions, all while se-\ncuring a safe airway for ventilation and providing a conduit  for  intraluminal  devices  such  as  flexible  bronchoscopes, balloons, stents, and ablative therapies. Thus, RB has rightfully become the cornerstone of interventional pulmonary (IP) training.\nDespite its increased utilization, there are limited data regarding  the  slope  and  variability  of  the  RB  learning curve. The importance of this gap has been further accentuated with the proliferation of IP training programs in the USA and worldwide [3], along with the inclusion and emphasis  on  RB  training  in  many  otolaryngology  and thoracic  surgery  programs  [4-6].  Without  robust  evidence, professional organizations including the American Thoracic Society (ATS), European Respiratory Society, and American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) have recommended a 20-procedure threshold for achieving RB competency [7-9], albeit with the recognition that such  numeric-threshold  criteria  for  competency  are fraught with limitations [6]. In addition, research in flexible  bronchoscopy  (FB)  and  endobronchial  ultrasound training has shown that learners acquire skills at different paces [10, 11].\nWe have previously developed the Rigid Bronchoscopy Tool  for  Assessment  of  Skills  and  Competence (RIGIDTASC), an assessment tool to evaluate RB intubation and airway navigation skills [12]. It is a 23-point checklistbased assessment tool that evaluates RB intubation and airway  navigation  by  an  operator.  RIGID-TASC  was demonstrated to have validity in discriminating the RB skills of novice, intermediate, and expert operators in a manikin, with a high inter-rater reliability. We thus hypothesized that\n1.  The RIGID-TASC can be used to effectively measure and plot the RB skill acquisition curve of IP trainees undergoing clinical training to the point where they achieve a predefined basic competency threshold.\n2.  The  skill  acquisition  curve  of  RB  learners  will  have markedly different slopes and variations, highlighting the necessity of competence-based testing, as opposed to adherence to volume-based criteria.",

      "content": "In this prospective, multicenter study, twelve novice IP fellows at  4  US  training  programs  were  recruited  and  scored  using  the RIGID-TASC while performing RB as part of their clinical training. All RBs performed by the trainees were supervised and scored by a faculty interventional pulmonologist, starting with their initial  procedure at the beginning of training, until the criteria for basic competency threshold were achieved. This basic competency\nthreshold was defined as successful RB intubation and central airway navigation at the first attempt, without a supervisor's help, with a minimum score of 89/100, on 3 consecutive procedures. The third consecutive successful procedure was recorded as the procedure when competency was achieved. The score of 89/100 was chosen as it was shown to be the minimum score attained by the expert group of rigid bronchoscopists during the initial validation study [12]. In order to control for and exclude the confounding effects of anatomic variability of patients and a 'lucky' accidental high score, we required 3 consecutive 89/100 scores. Since not all patients required every element of RB tested by the RIGID-TASC (e.g., navigation of mainstem bronchi in patients with tracheal stenosis  or  tumors),  the  score  percentage  was  calculated  from  the clinically  necessary,  completed  subtasks.  IRB  approval  was  obtained  at  all  respective  institutions:  Duke  University  (Pro00055274), Virginia Commonwealth University (HM20002272), Johns Hopkins University (00139179), and Emory University (00075805).

      "content": "Twelve participants were recruited upon starting their IP training between 2014 and 2017 (demographics shown in Table 1). After the initial pre-patient contact training (lecture and RB simulation on manikin and RB practice on cadaver at the IP Boot Camp), every clinical RB procedure was scored using the RIGID-TASC, starting from\nthe first procedure until the threshold of 3 consecutive scores of 89 at first attempt was achieved (Fig. 1). The clinical  indications  included  malignant  central  airway obstruction (38%), nonmalignant central airway obstruction (53%), and other miscellaneous indications (9%). A total of 178 RB procedures were performed by the participants and scored by the supervising IP faculty.\nParticipant learners achieved the threshold of 3 consecutive scores of 89 at first attempt in as few as 5 to as many as 24 RB procedures, with a median of 15 RBs. The performance of individual participants and summary regression curve is shown in Figure 1. There was a wide fluctuation of scores until a consistent plateau was achieved. In addition to the wide range of the scores obtained, participants were markedly different in their beginning score, slope of the learning curve, and inflection point (see online suppl. Fig. 1, 2 and see online suppl. Table 1). Trainees achieved the threshold of 3 consecutive scores of 89 at first attempt at different procedure volumes with 25% compe-\nRB, rigid bronchoscopy; FB, flexible bronchoscopy; IP, interventional pulmonary; IQR, interquartile range.\ntent at 9 RBs (95% CI, 5-15); 50% at 15 procedures (95% CI, 6-21); 75% at 20 RB (95% CI, 15-24); and 100% trainees at 24 RB, as shown on the cumulative incidence curve in online suppl. Fig. 3.\nWe also assessed the learners' performance of different steps of RB using subtasks of the RIGID-TASC checklist, in order to determine which subtasks were most difficult to master as shown in Table 2 and Figure 2. The competency threshold for the subtask was defined as the ability to perform that subtask without any assistance from the\nsupervisor in 3 consecutive RB procedures. Two subtasks were the most difficult to master as they needed the most number of attempts to achieve the threshold of 3 consecutive successful attempts: the ability to intubate the patient on the first attempt (median 10, IQR 8-16) and ability to complete intubation from introduction of bronchoscope into mouth to trachea within 1 min (median 9.5, IQR 7-18.2).

They were of the opinion that their current IP fellowship offered adequate opportunity to gain competence in RB, and most of them believed that RB is an advanced skill which should be learned in a dedicated fellowship program. They also felt that RB would be incorporated into their clinical practice after the training. There were a few complications associated with RB, including 1 loose tooth, 2 upper airway mucosal injuries, 2 lower airway mucosal injuries, and 2 incidents of hypoxemia with oxygen saturation of ≤88%.",

      "title": "Discussion",
      "content": "This is the first study to objectively measure, plot, and compare the skill acquisition of RB learners in a clinical setting.  We  used  a  previously  published  tool,  RIGIDTASC [12], to objectively assess serial RBs performed by IP trainees until a designated competency threshold was reached; this was defined as independently performing RB intubation and navigation in 3 consecutive patients at first attempt while obtaining a predefined score. We demonstrated that RIGID-TASC could accurately measure the minimal fluctuations in operator performance from 1 procedure to the next, and it was effectively used to  measure  and  plot  RB  skill  acquisition  curves  in  IP trainees to the threshold where a consistent level of competency  was  achieved.  More  significantly,  we  demonstrated that there was a difference in the rate that skills were acquired as the learners had learning curves that varied widely.\nThe trainees obtained a wide range of scores on their initial  RB,  while  their  gradual  upward  trends  also  followed different curves in terms of shape, slope, acceleration (negative vs. positive), degree of up-and-down fluctuation, and the inflection point leading to the plateau. We used a curve-fitting technique that was modified to depict and compare the different important parameters such as starting point, slope, inflection point, and plateau. Similar statistical methodology has been used in surgical competency assessment literature [13], yet it has not been utilized to assess bronchoscopy learning patterns.\nPrior studies have shown that learners acquire procedural skills and achieve competency at differing rates. In a study looking at the experience of thirteen pulmonary fellows learning endobronchial ultrasound, the trainees needed a varying number of procedures (5-13), in order to perform the procedure independently [11]. Our study demonstrated that the learning curve for RB is more variable, with the number of procedures required to achieve initial competency ranging from 5 to 24 procedures. This further underscores the notion that one-size-fits-all number criteria to achieve competency ignore this inter-learner variability.\nProfessional societies are mandated to develop minimum standards to certify the competency of graduating trainees.  To  this  end,  ATS  and  ACCP  have  published guidelines, based on the expert opinion, suggesting twenty RBs as threshold to achieve initial competency [7-9]. These organizations, and later a multi-society IP fellowship  accreditation  committee,  have  acknowledged  the limitation of procedure-volume quota as a competency metric [3]. An ACCP expert panel has recommended that organizations certifying pulmonary trainees should transition from volume-based certification to objective competency assessments based on skill and knowledge acquisition [6]. We use RIGID-TASC, a previously developed assessment tool, to address this gap for basic RB training. We demonstrate that it can effectively measure and plot the  skill  acquisition  of  trainees  from  the  point  of  skill transfer in a simulation laboratory to achievement of clinical competency threshold.\nIn an era of simulation-based education, it is now established that patients must not bear the burdens of procedure-related training. The higher the risk of potential harm a procedure may pose to our patients, the more imperative\nchea;  (16)  keeps  scope  centered;  (17)  intubation  attempts;  (18) teeth guard use; (19) turns head to left to advance scope into right mainstem bronchus; (20) able to advance scope into bronchus intermedius; (21) turns the head to the right to advance scope into left mainstem bronchus; (22) able to insert scope into distal left mainstem bronchus; (23) able to introduce scope from mouth to trachea in <60 s. RIGID-TASC, Rigid Bronchoscopy Tool for Assessment of Skills and Competence.\nColor version available online\nit becomes that the basic skills are learned on a simulation model [10]. The next important step is the seamless transfer of the acquired skills to the clinical setting. The effectiveness of this skill transfer has been demonstrated in many procedural  fields  [14-16].  Of  the  different  major  procedures taught during IP fellowship, RB is one of the most invasive procedures that can lead to significant morbidities if performed poorly. The ability to objectively demonstrate the effective transfer of RB skills to the patient's bedside, while measuring and plotting the learning curve to a competency threshold is of utmost importance; we demonstrated this process in the current study. In addition, each learner's RIGID-TASC scores, especially the sub-scores for each of the constituent components, were used by supervising faculty to deliver personalized, objective feedback, making this a process of iterative deliberate practice. Repeated use of an assessment tool to guide learning is what has been coined as dynamic testing or assessment [17, 18].\nA major reason we broke down RB into its stepwise components in RIGID-TASC was to guide the process of iterative feedback between consecutive procedures. There are 23 steps or subtasks necessary to perform RB intubation  and  airway  navigation  based  on  RIGID-TASC. We found that trainees had the most difficulty with and needed more procedures to learn composite tasks: intubation at first  attempt  and  completion  of  intubation  within  60  s. Other areas which required more procedures were centering the RB during airway navigation and avoiding unnecessary trauma to the arytenoids, vocal cords, and lower airway. Salud and colleagues [5] had also observed that during RB on a pressure-sensor mounted manikin, a key feature that differentiates novice from expert bronchoscopists is a higher number of unnecessary tissue contact and increased pressure. Acquiring this precise, objective data for each individual learner allows for extra remedial attention and deliberate practice, focused on each learner's weaknesses.\nExtensive research exists on the rates and patterns with which learners acquire procedural skills. A significant portion of this literature focuses on the different factors that impact the characteristics of the learning curve [19]. Some of the more crucial factors include the nature of the task, in terms of complexity and ratio of pure motor versus cognitive and other skills; task difficulty as it impacts positive versus negative acceleration of the curve, and how intense difficulty makes the task less sensitive to deliberate practice; degree of prior learning, either of the entire task or its components;  the  threshold  for  training  termination,  when 'mastery level' has been achieved; the temporal distribution of practice and the role of interference and forgetting; differences among individuals and training methods; the\neffects of interest and motivation; and the correlations between the pattern and slope of learning curve with retention. We devised a novel curve-fitting model and successfully pilot-tested it to create a template for RB. This model can also be used to systematically determine learning curves for  other  procedures.  We can then assess how changing combinations of the factors listed above may impact the slope, inflection, and plateau of the learning curve and ultimately  the  training  outcome.  This  information  can  be used to improve coaching methodology and parameters, training more effective and masterful operators while improving return on investment in resources and time.\nThe strengths of our study include the prospective utilization of a previously developed assessment tool to objectively measure the acquisition of clinical RB skills by IP trainees and the use of an innovative curve-fitting model to plot learning curves for comparison. The weaknesses of the study include small sample size of participants and that  knowledge,  cognitive,  and  decision-making  skills were not assessed. The score of 89 was chosen as the minimum criterion for basic competency because it was the lowest score achieved by one of the experts in the original validation study [12]. We also did not include assessment of adjunct therapeutic procedures, performed either by flexible  bronchoscope  introduced  through  rigid  bronchoscope - such as self-expandable stent placement and use of ablative therapies - or RB coring and silicone stent placement. There are different competency metrics for these  endobronchial  procedures,  as  underscored  by  an ACCP statement [9]. As training in the therapeutic procedures logically follows achievement of competence in RB intubation and navigation, these adjunct skills could be evaluated in future studies.",
