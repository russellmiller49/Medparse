Conclusions Airway occlusion stenting appears to be a feasible and effective technique for treatment of bronchopleural fistula. Keywords Lung cancer · Pulmonary resection · Bronchopleural fistula · Stent · Interventional radiology Bronchopleural fistula after pulmonary resection is a serious complication that occurs in 1.5-8% of patients; it is associated with a mortality rate of 13.4-67% [1, 2]. Improvements in surgical techniques and better understanding of the mechanism of bronchial stump healing in recent years have resulted in a decrease in the incidence of these fistulas, but it remains a major worry for the thoracic surgeon [3, 4]. Occasionally, a small bronchopleural fistula may heal with conservative management, but the vast majority of fistulas do not heal spontaneously, and long-standing chest and lung infection can severely debilitate the patient [5]. Bronchopleural fistula is commonly treated by thoracic drainage, fistula repair, omental flap, and thoracoplasty. However, this is a complex procedure that is associated with major trauma and a high failure rate. Besides, most patients with middle- and late-stage bronchopleural fistula are debilitated by long-standing infection and are not fit to withstand the stresses of a second surgery. There have been occasional reports in the literature of non-surgical treatment of bronchopleural fistulas with the use of stents, tissue glue, coils, N -butyl cyanoacrylate glue, Amplatzer™ vascular plug, or other occluder techniques [6-11], but no large studies have been conducted. After studying the anatomical and pathophysiological features of bronchopleural fistulas after pulmonary resection, as well as the shortcomings of the airway stents currently available, we designed and patented a series of airway stents for dedicated bronchopleural fistula occlusion [12] (Fig. 1). We performed individualized airway stent implantation to treat 148 cases of bronchopleural fistulas. In this report we retrospectively analyze the effect of the procedure and summarize our clinical experience",

      "content": "The stent used in each patient was customized on the basis of measurements derived from chest CT, bronchoscopy, and airway radiography (with water-soluble contrast injected via the catheter), if necessary. The stent was manufactured to our specifications by Micro-Tech Co., Ltd., Nanjing, Jiangsu, China. These novel covered airway stents had a bullet head or a special part that served to occlude the fistula. The\ndiameters for the main body, branch portion, and bullet head of the stent were generally 15-20% larger than the diameter of the corresponding airway. Stent type was decided by the location and length of the bronchial stump (Fig. 2A-J; Table 1). A hinged self-expandable covered metallic stent with a bullet head was used for bronchopleural fistulas with bronchial stump length > 20 mm, a Y-shaped self-expandable covered metallic stent with a bullet head when the bronchial stump length was 5-20 mm, and an L-shaped selfexpandable covered metallic stent when the bronchial stump length was < 5 mm. Due to the big difference in the diameter between the right main bronchus and the right middle bronchus, a stent with a thick proximal part and thin distal end branches was chosen for stenting in this area.\nAll procedures were performed with the patient supine and under conscious sedation, with tetracaine spray used for local anesthesia. Under fluoroscopic guidance, a 5F catheter over a wire was introduced transorally into the trachea. A transcatheter injection of 5 mL of 2% lidocaine was given first as local anesthesia and then 3 mL of watersoluble contrast was injected to confirm the site and size of the fistula. Interventional radiological techniques were employed to place or remove the stents. In all cases, insertion and removal of stents were performed by interventional radiologists [13-15]. After placement of the stent, its position and the success of occlusion were checked via tracheobronchography.",

The chest drainage catheter\nwas connected to a syringe by a multidirectional stopcock. Continuous negative pressure of 10-20 mm Hg was applied by the syringe for thoracic drainage. Nebulization and antibiotic treatment (according to bacterial culture reports) were used to reduce phlegm and control infection. The shrinkage of the thoracic cavity was followed up by monthly (or more frequently if the patient was symptomatic) chest CT. The stent position and the airway patency were checked by monthly bronchoscopy. Before removing the stent, the presence of granulation tissue was looked for and, if necessary, ablated under bronchoscopy.\nThe stent was removed when (1) the patient was cured; (2) the stent was damaged (degradation of components due to wear and tear caused by respiration- and heart beat-induced movements); or (3) there was proliferation of granulation tissue severe enough to compromise the patient's breathing. The drainage catheter was removed after disappearance of the residual cavity. The drainage catheter was retained if the residual pleural cavity had not disappeared at the time of stent removal.\nSuccessful stenting was defined as immediate cessation of air leak from the residual cavity after stenting. A patient was considered to be cured if the residual cavity had disappeared completely and the stent and chest drainage catheter had been removed. The primary outcome of this study was the technical success rate. The secondary outcome was the cure rate after stent removal.\nThe technical success rate, time to stent removal, shortterm and long-term follow-up results, change in residual cavity drainage, and complications were analyzed.",

In these cases, tracheobronchography showed complete fistula occlusion, with no gas spillovers in the chest drainage tube. In 5 patients, the first attempt at occlusion of fistula with airway stenting failed; these were immediately identified by airway radiography, with water-soluble contrast injected via the catheter. One of these patients, who had a left main bronchopleural fistula, was treated with a hinged self-expandable covered metallic stent with a bullet head, but post-procedure airway radiography showed contrast spillover. The stent was removed, and inspection revealed a manufacturing defect (a 1 mm hole in the stent bullet). Replacement with another hinged\nself-expandable covered metallic stent of the same type and size was sufficient for achieving successful fistula occlusion. In 2 patients with right main bronchial stumps of < 20 mm length, the hinged self-expandable covered metallic stents failed to completely occlude the fistula; replacement with Y-shaped self-expandable covered metallic stents was sufficient to achieve good fistula occlusion. In the other 2 patients, the failure to achieve occlusion on the first attempt was due to the large difference between chest CT measurement and the actual size of the airway to be stented, which led to the selection of inappropriately sized stents; substitution with stents of the correct sizes provided good occlusion of the fistulas.\nFor 2 patients who had left main bronchopleural fistulas combined with middle esophagopleural fistulas, esophageal stents, and bronchopleural fistula occlusion stents were placed separately.",

      "content": "In this study, airway occlusion stenting was successful on the first attempt in 143/148 (96.6%) patients with bronchopleural fistulas. In the remaining 5 patients, occlusion was successful only on the second try. At follow-up 30 days after stenting, 141 patients reported relief in symptoms.\nThe aim of treatment of bronchopleural fistula is to improve quality of life and survival time of the patients by repairing or occluding the fistula and eradicating the residual pleural cavity. In our series, fistula occlusion stenting showed good efficacy, especially over the short term, with patients showing progressive reduction in the size of the residual cavity and the drainage volume, as well as obvious relief in symptoms such as cough, hemoptysis, chest pain, and dyspnea.\nEarly bronchopleural fistula (i.e., developing in the first week after pulmonary resection) leads to a sensation of chest tightness and may be associated with subcutaneous emphysema, mediastinal swing (which seriously impairs the blood circulation), and contralateral lung infection. Delayed bronchopleural fistula (i.e., occurring 8-30 days after pulmonary resection) can lead to aspiration pneumonia and other chest infections, weight loss, and poor general health. Late bronchopleural fistulas generally occur 30 days after pulmonary resection, with patients presenting with weight loss, fatigue, poor general health, and progressive debilitation [16]. We found that the earlier the stent was placed, the sooner it could be removed.\nBronchopleural fistulas have been treated with various types of stents previously, but in these patients the stents were implanted permanently [17-22]. There are no reports in the literature describing airway stenting for treatment of\nupper or lower lobar bronchus fistulas. For lobar bronchus fistulas after lobectomy, the treatment has traditionally been a pneumonectomy; this approach, however, involves major trauma and results in increase in size of the residual pleural cavity and may also lead to the formation of a bronchopleural fistula again [23].\nBronchopleural fistula residual stump length, fistula location, and the associated anatomical relationships vary widely, which makes individualized choice of stent type and size advisable. In our series, the hinged self-expandable covered metallic stent with a bullet head was used for bronchopleural fistulas with bronchial stump length  >  20 mm; in these cases, the bullet head can occlude the fistula effectively. However, it cannot occlude the fistula when the bronchial stump length is 5-20 mm, and so the Y-shaped self-expandable covered metallic stent with a bullet head was preferred in these cases. With bronchial stump length < 5 mm, only the L-shaped self-expandable covered metallic stent was applied. In 2 patients, inappropriate selection of stent type and size resulted in failure of the procedure. Therefore, stent selection should take into account individual anatomical variations, which should help improve success rates and decrease the incidence of complications.\nGranulation tissue is the success-limiting step in patients undergoing this procedure. Therefore, it is necessary to study the mechanism of healing of the residual cavity and to identify methods to promote healing so that the stent can be removed as soon as possible. New types of stent material should also be developed that will help reduce proliferation of granulation tissue.\nThere are some drawbacks associated with airway stenting for bronchopleural fistula treatment. A stent in the airway acts as a foreign body and, despite improvements in airway stent materials and placement techniques, airway stent-related problems such as chest discomfort, expectoration difficulties, and granulation tissue formation cannot be totally avoided.\nIn summary, airway occlusion stenting is a novel treatment for bronchopleural fistula. The technology is still immature, and further research is needed to identify methods to shorten abscess healing time and to establish the ideal time for removal of the stent.\nAcknowledgements We thank the pulmonologists at our hospital for their assistance in this study.",
