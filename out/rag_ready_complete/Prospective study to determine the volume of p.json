Pairwise comparisons of the three volumes were done within each logistic model. The testing level was set at 0.05. No adjustments were done for multiple comparisons because all three pairwise comparisons for each of the four outcomes were set a priori and of equal importance. Direct smear/ cytospin alone and the combination of direct smear/cytospin and cell blocks were considered. x 2  tests were done to assess the relationship  of  demographics/past  medical  history  information  and malignancy diagnosis.\nThe initial sample size calculations were based on seeing a 10% difference  in  sensitivities  between  any  two  volume  levels.  This was the observed difference between the fi  rst and fourth quartiles in our previous retrospective study. 14  It was assumed that the proportion of discordant pairs would be around 12%. With these assumptions and power set at 80%, a at 0.05, and two-sided testing, a sample size of 77 patient encounters with malignant pleural effusions would be required. Hence, the total number of patient encounters  estimated  was  130,  which  assumed  that  60%  of the  patient  encounters  would  be  positive  for  malignancy.  The increased number of malignant effusions obtained in our patient encounters (90 instead of 77) enabled us to perform the analysis within the power calculations for the total number of patient encounters we are reporting (121).",

The study was performed at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan, and received Institutional Review Board approval. Between September 1, 2001, and August 31, 2007, 102 patients (60 women and 42 men) underwent diagnostic thoracentesis  yielding  121  pleural  fl  uid  samples.  Eligible  patients included those suspected of having a malignant pleural effusion (n 5 94)  or  patients  with  a  known  malignant  pleural  effusion undergoing a subsequent thoracentesis (n 5 8). The defi  nition of 'suspected malignancy' was left to the clinical judgment of the senior  attending  pulmonologist  who  ordered  the  thoracentesis. Criteria typically included a history of a known malignancy, chest pain, weight loss, cigarette smoking, and the absence of symptoms or  fi  ndings  that  would  suggest  an  infection  or  congestive  heart failure as the cause of the effusion. In addition, all patients had a  moderate to large pleural effusion, defi  ned as greater than or equal to one-third of a hemithorax.\nThe patient underwent a diagnostic thoracentesis in which the initial  10  to  30  mL  was  sent  for  biochemical  and  microbiologic studies if desired by the attending physician performing the procedure. Subsequently, aliquots of 10 mL, 60 mL, and ≥ 150 mL were obtained and placed in separate specimen containers and labeled as such. These specimens were hand delivered by a research team member to the cytopathology laboratory. All the samples were processed by one cytotechnologist as per Henry Ford Hospital cytopathology laboratory protocol. 16  The entire volume of each aliquot sample was centrifuged. Direct smears were prepared from the visible sediment. If the centrifuged sample was clear, cytospin preparations were made. Cell blocks were performed if the specimen contained clot or if the visible sediment remaining after making the smears was suffi  cient to make the block.\nAll  the  direct  smears/cytospins  were  stained  by  Papanicolaou smears and cell blocks were stained by hematoxylin and eosin. 16  No immunostains were used on any of the samples. These were initially reviewed as nonblinded, nonstudy slides by a senior staff pathologist to determine if malignancy existed, and the result was reported as positive or negative for malignancy. This initial reading was only used to compare interobserver reliability between the pathologist reading the initial specimen the day it was delivered to the laboratory and the pathologist later reading the blinded study slides.\nUpon completion of the enrollment process and reaching the target number of participants for our study population, all study slides were obtained and blinded as to pleural fl  uid volume and patient information. These blinded slides were analyzed by a single attending pathologist (S.K.) for the presence or absence of malignancy. Charts were reviewed to obtain patient demographics and cytopathologic and clinical diagnoses. The gold standard for diagnosis was the cytologic or histologic confi  rmation of a malignant pleural effusion within 6 months of the initial thoracentesis, or CT scan fi  ndings of pleural thickening or nodularity in a patient with a known underlying malignancy that had been pathologically confi  rmed.\nThe  objective  of  this  study  was  to  compare  the  sensitivities, specifi  cities, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV) for three different fl  uid volumes (10 mL, 60 mL, and ≥ 150  mL).  Logistic  regression  models  using  generalized estimating equations methods were used to compare the four measures between the fl  uid volumes, taking into account the correlation among volumes (10 mL, 60 mL, and ≥ 150 mL) within\na\nfl  uid  volumes were included. The sample size was 107 pleural fl  uid specimens, of which 78 (72.9%) were positive.   Table 3 contains the numbers of samples and positive results, together with the sensitivities,  specifi  cities,  PPV,  and  NPV for the three fl  uid volumes  using  direct  smear/cytospin  results.  The differences between 10 mL and 60 mL and between 10 mL and ≥ 150 mL were signifi  cant for sensitivity and NPV. No signifi  cant differences for sensitivity  and  NPV  value  were  observed  between  60  mL and ≥ 150 mL. Also, no signifi  cant differences were detected between any of the fl  uid volumes for specifi  city and PPV.",

As in the previous analyses, only samples with information for all three fl  uid volumes were included. The sample size was 71 with 54 (76.1%) patient encounters positive.   Table 4 contains the sensitivities, specifi  cities, PPV, and NPV for the three fl  uid volumes  using  direct  smear/cytospin  and  cell  block results.

Also,  no signifi  cant differences were detected between the fl  uid volumes for specifi  city and PPV.\nFourteen of 60 samples that were initially read as negative were determined to be positive by the blinded pathologist.

When both direct smear/cytospin and cell block processing was done, there was a signifi  cant difference in positivity only between the 10-mL and the ≥ 150-mL volume.\nFor  patients  diagnosed  with  pleural  malignancy by thoracentesis, the cancer cell types were consistent with previous literature, with lung cancer the most common followed by breast cancer.  2  The cancer cell types for patients with a pleural malignancy diagnosed by means other than the study thoracentesis  (subsequent  nonstudy  thoracentesis,  pleural biopsy, CT chest fi  ndings) are listed in   Table 2  . Lung and breast cancer were the most common malignancies  diagnosed in this group followed by mesothelioma, which is inherently diffi  cult to diagnose by thoracentesis.\nWe have no explanation for the greater number of women included in our study. Previous authors have suggested  that  more  females  will  have  a  malignant pleural effusion because breast cancer is the second most common cause of a malignant pleural effusion. 2 In  our  study,  17  of  the  60  women  who  underwent thoracentesis had a diagnosis of breast cancer (28%). A previous study observed greater sensitivity of pleural  fl  uid  analysis  in  women. 14   However,  this  should have  made  small-volume  thoracentesis  more  sensitive, given the larger percentage of women included in our study.\nThere are several potential limitations of our study. The  long  recruitment  of  patients  into  our  study  is explained by at least two factors. The attending physician  had  to  consider  study  enrollment  of  a  patient undergoing a thoracentesis and decide to notify one of the study investigators to enroll the patient. In addition, the attending physician performing the thoracentesis had to suspect malignancy to include the patient in the study. During the 6-year period of our study, 74 thoracenteses  were  performed  on  average  per  year in the pulmonary department. We were able to enroll 27%  of  the  patients  who  had  a  thoracentesis  performed during this time.

Previous authors have suggested ranges from 2 to 3 mL of fl  uid  to several hundred milliliters. 7,22 Sallach et al 14 from our institution performed a retrospective study, from which they concluded that 10 mL of fl  uid was just as likely to be positive on cytologic assessment when malignancy is present as were larger volumes of pleural fl  uid. A recent prospective study, in which 23   patients were diagnosed with pleural malignancy by thoracentesis, showed no difference between 50 mL of  pleural  fl  uid  and  larger  volumes  of  fl  uid  for  the cytologic diagnosis of malignancy. This study did not evaluate pleural fl  uid volumes , 50 mL. 15\nWe performed our study to reevaluate the previous  retrospective  results  from  our  institution  in  a prospective study. Our study, which was designed so that each patient served as his/her own control, does not  support  our  earlier  results.

Based  on  our  prospectively  derived  data  and  the  recent  study  by Abouzgheib  et  al, 15   we  now  recommend  that  the minimal  volume  of  pleural  fl  uid  to  facilitate  the diagnosis of pleural malignancy should be 50 to 60 mL, whenever  this  is  possible.  As  hypothesized  in  an editorial that accompanied our earlier retrospective study, 'pleural fl  uid cells may not be homogeneously distributed within the pleural fl  uid. Cells may settle in a gravity-dependent gradient that creates an environment  whereby  a  larger  volume  will  more likely recover malignant cells. This seems feasible in patients who often have limited activity and remain recumbent for long periods due to their underlying malignancy.'  23",
