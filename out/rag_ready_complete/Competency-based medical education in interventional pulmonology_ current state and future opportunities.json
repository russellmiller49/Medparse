CBME, established to address these issues, relies on outcome-based assessments to ensure trainees achieve necessary competencies. The chapter reviews various assessment tools, including global rating scales, checklists, and simulation-based methods, and their effectiveness in skill acquisition and clinical evaluation. It also covers specific procedures such as Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy, and rigid bronchoscopy, discussing their assessment tools and learning curves. The chapter emphasizes the need for standardized assessment tools and suggests using entrustable professional activities (EPAs) to improve competency evaluation. Future directions include integrating real-time artificial intelligence feedback, addressing high-risk low-volume procedures, and enhancing workplace-based assessments to improve interventional pulmonology training and patient care quality.",

      "title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "content": "Interventional pulmonology training programs started in 1996, as the need for specialized education in advanced bronchoscopy and pleural techniques was recognized. Since that time, interventional pulmonology has grown to include 42 individual training programs in the United States and achieved accreditation from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). Traditionally, training in interventional pulmonology has been an apprenticeship model and competency deemed by surrogate measures (case logs and program director attestation). Outcomes from this model of training are varied, as there is no standardizedcurriculumandfewstandardizedassessments [1 & ]. In contrast, competency-based medical education (CBME) uses an outcomes approach to ensure all trainees have achieved the appropriate patientoriented competencies prior to graduation. This\napproach has been embraced by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada [2] as well as the American Board or Surgeons [3 & ,4,5]. Interventional pulmonary requires trainees to master multiple procedural skills; however, the new ACGME requirements do not stipulate procedural numbers or methods to objectively determine competency. For the field of interventional pulmonology to move towards CBME, the development of tools to directly assess competency of trainees remains a top priority.\nDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA\nCorrespondence to Darlene R.

      "title": "VALIDATED MODELS FOR PROCEDURAL TRAINING ASSESSMENT AND LEARNING THEORY",
      "content": "Assessing competency requires multiple tools to capture distinct realms in adult learning including cognitive assessment, skills mastery, clinical performance assessment, and ongoing education through professional review of cases [6].\nThe tools should provide a sound assessment of knowledgeandskillandhelpeducatorsmonitorboth trainee and program performance [7]. Before using any assessment tool, one should investigate the evidence for the validity of its interpretation. Messick's\nunitary framework of validity proposes that all validity is 'construct' validity gathered from different sources [8]. This method of validity assessment is frequently utilized to develop and establish evidence for the validity of assessment tools. The five sources of validity evidence are summarized in Table 1.\nUltimately, validity is a property of the interpretation of the tool and not of the tool itself. This is well stated by Downing, 'Validity requires an evidentiary chain which clearly links the interpretation of . . . scores . . . to a network of theory, hypothesis, and logic which are presented to support or refute the reasonableness of the desired interpretations') [9]. As an example, the evidence must show that the test scores of an assessment tool correlate to a proposed outcome such as competency or patient safety and shouldideallybeabletodistinguishlevelsofexpertise.\nIn procedural teaching, there are two broad approaches to skills assessment and include global rating scales (GRS) and checklists. GRS are subjective but widely applicable and can be modified to assess different procedures. Checklists are a structured format in which a trainee must appropriately identify sequential steps to performing a procedure correctly and can be used as guidance in longer complex procedures [6]. GRS are useful, as they typically have high average inter-item and inter-station reliability and may be better at detecting nuanced elements in developing expertise. Both checklists and GRS have high inter-rater reliability [10]. Pairing GRS and checklists is often employed to develop actionable assessments.\nStandard setting in medical education has been described in several articles, which are often done through one of the methods for setting performance standards described in Table 2 [11,12].\nThe standard setting methods described in Table 2 are useful to set passing scores and develop and gather evidence for validity of an assessment tool. In clinical/procedural training, an emphasis can be placed on the patient safety method, and subsequently contrasting groups methods when evaluating for competency and subsequently expertise. These tools can also be used to develop learning curves to assess and reassess performance over time.",

      "content": "/C15 Interventional pulmonology training has evolved from an apprenticeship model to a competency-based medical education (CBME) approach, focusing on standardized assessment tools.\n/C15 The use of assessment tools with evidence for validity is crucial for evaluating procedural skills and learning curves in interventional pulmonology.\n/C15 Simulation training has proven effective in accelerating competency acquisition and should be integrated into interventional pulmonology training programs.\n/C15 The development of entrustable professional activities (EPAs) could enhance competency assessment and bridge gaps in current training methods.\n/C15 Addressing high-risk, low-volume procedures through targeted training and assessment is essential for comprehensive interventional pulmonology education and patient safety.\nLearning curves are a form of measurement used to associate the learning effort, via number of procedures performed, and the subsequent learning outcome. Learning curves can then be created for individual trainees to assess when competency in a procedure has been achieved based on assessment tools with published validity evidence for their use in training/simulation. Key defining factors for learning curves depends upon the assessment method; some assessments may be checklist based (i.e. does a trainee know basic steps to performs procedure) vs. clinical outcomes (i.e. is the desired outcome achieved such as diagnostic yield) [13].",

This same meta-analysis also showed that low-fidelity simulation training performed slightly better than high fidelity simulation training making simulation more easily accessible and readily available compared to expensive simulators [14]. Additionally, simulation training has been shown to decrease time to achieve competency in basic bronchoscopy [15]. The importance of simulation is highlighted by the fact that there are increased procedural complications when trainees are the primary bronchoscopist [16]. Overall, the body of evidence supports simulation training as a preceding factor to patient care and will form the basis of low-stakes evaluation of clinical skills.",

      "title": "Inspection bronchoscopy",
      "content": "Inspection bronchoscopy is an essential skill set in interventional pulmonology. In order to assess baseline competency, the Bronchoscopy Skills and Tasks Assessment Tool (BSTAT) and Bronchoscopy Step by Step Evaluation Tool (BSET) were developed using\nvirtual reality simulation training [17]. This tool has been used subsequently in the clinical context and has been able to differentiate between learners at different levels [15]. Konge et al. [18] developed a novel bronchoscopy assessment tool that could be used after the fact and was done with recorded bronchoscopies. This tool was able to distinguish between different learner levels and had the advantage of eliminating bias that can occur as a result of the human relationship between the rater and ratee [18]. Both the BSTAT and tool developed by Konge et al. [18] focused mainly on the technical aspects of the procedure. A group out of Ontario subsequently developed the Ontario Bronchoscopy Assessment Tool (OBAT) to provide assessment of all aspects of the basic bronchoscopy procedure including preprocedural and post procedural aspects. This novel 12-point tool is based on an entrustability scale and was developed to be used clinically [19]. The OBAT was tested with novice and advanced fellows and was able to accurately distinguish between the groups. When used longitudinally, it also showed significant variation in learning curves before competency was achieved [20]. This highlights the importance of using assessment tools to determine competency rather than a global 'minimum number.' Recently, an interesting study on training in inspection bronchoscopy demonstrated that simulation training was superior to the traditional model of teaching with apprenticeship [21]. Siow et al. [21] demonstrated that structured simulation training led to improved cognitive and technical skills performance compared to the control group highlighting the central role that simulation training deserves in bronchoscopy education.",

      "content": "Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA) typically represents the first step up in skill from basic diagnostic bronchoscopy where learners must integrate 2D imaging with a knowledge base of airway anatomy, mediastinal anatomy, and radiology. Importantly, when teaching the anatomy acquisition of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), emphasis should be placed on consistency in procedural planning and evaluation to avoid procedural errors in mediastinal diagnosis and staging. One approach is the six landmarks approach utilized by the European respiratory society (ERS) described in Table 3 [22].\nTo evaluate procedural competence in Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), the endobronchial ultrasound skills and task assessment tool (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-STAT) was developed. This 10-section check-list based assessment has published outcomes of the tool with respect to content, internal structure, andrelationshiptoothervariables.Ithasbeenusedas\nan objective measure of competency for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) [23]. Similarly, the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) Assessment tool (EBUSAT) is a 12item assessment tool developed by experts and has demonstrated high internal consistency, high discrimination ability, and assigned a pass/fail standard utilizing the contrasting groups methods [24]. Subsequent studies show these tools can guide learners through multiple high or low fidelity simulation models [25], with simulation again appearing to be more effective in the initial learning curve phase compared to apprenticeship training [24].\nA systematic review of simulation-based studies revealed overall that simulation is an effective method for initial training and assessment of competency in Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA [26]. Studies of learning curves for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) demonstrate that competency is achieved somewhere between 55 and 60 procedures [27]. This learning curve may be shortened if a trainee completes a minimum of 30 standard bronchoscopies prior to Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) training. The new learning curve in this setting was an average of 13 procedures [28]. It is important to note however that the expertise required of interventional pulmonology physicians is likely higher, as expert level was not attained until an average of 164 procedures and efficiency continued to improve even up to 200 cases [29].",

Retesting after 6 months revealed that a sizable portion of trainees were unable to pass some parts of the initial examination [46].\nFurthermore, spaced competency assessment in generating learning curves may be beneficial in multiple ways, including, identify areas of weakness near end of training, but prior to completion, provide CME for those taking time away from training for research years, and provide opportunities for those who are in practice that would benefit from skill refresher courses.",

Interventional pulmonology is now ACGME accredited, and a standardized curriculum for programs has been published. In this study, we reviewed current assessment tools, their evidence for validity, and where learning curves have been demonstrated. This body of work is commendable; however, there is still work to be done. Some studies reviewed herein did not demonstrate a second slope in the learning curves. This indicates the learners achieved basic competency; however, this does not always translate to clinically relevant diagnostic yield, or achieving mastery of a procedure. How do we move toward workplace-based assessments that can be used during daily clinical activities and include metrics like diagnostic accuracy, procedure time, and patient outcomes to help determine mastery [47 && ]?\nOne way to potentially bridge this gap is utilizing EPAs. EPAs are observed behaviors (or a unit of work) that physicians do (such as managing a patient with a specific medical condition). This is different than a competency, which is instead a broad domain of ability such as medical knowledge. This has been studied in other medical fields and has\nserved to operationalize competency evaluation and related entrustment decisions in patient care. Developing EPA's specific to the practice of interventional pulmonology are needed and would enhance skill assessment and be an aid to determining graduates' ability to practice independently.\nAnother strong area for growth in the field is the use of artificial intelligence real-time feedback in simulation and potentially clinical cases combining ergonomic,motionanalysis,anddiagnosticyield[48 && ,49].\nFinally, competency-based training on high-risk low-volume procedures: management of massive hemoptysis, emergency airway management in central airway obstruction, or tracheoinnominate fistula should be further explored.",

Chest 2023; 164:952 -962.\nThis systematic review assesses the effectiveness of simulation-based training (SBT) for teaching flexible bronchoscopy to novice trainees. It concludes that while most studies report positive effects of SBT, there is considerable variability in training features and moderate to high risk of bias in the studies reviewed. The review emphasizes the need for standardized training protocols and further research on the impact of SBT on real-world bronchoscopy performance.\n48. Cold KM, Xie S, Nielsen AO, et al.

The study finds that artificial intelligence guidance significantly improves diagnostic completeness, structured progress, and reduces procedure time for novices. This research supports the integration of artificial intelligence tools into bronchoscopy training to enhance learning outcomes for beginners.\n49. Colella S, Sondergaard Svendsen MB, Konge L, et al.
