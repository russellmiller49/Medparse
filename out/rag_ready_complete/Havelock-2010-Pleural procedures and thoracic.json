      "content": "In hospital practice, pleural aspiration (thoracocentesis) and chest drain insertion may be required in many different clinical settings for a variety of indications. Doctors in most specialities will be exposed to patients requiring pleural drainage and need to be aware of safe techniques. There have been many reports of the dangers of large-bore chest drains and it had been anticipated that, with the previous guidelines, better training and the advent of small-bore Seldinger technique chest drains, there would have been an improvement. Unfortunately the descriptions of serious complications continue, and in 2008 the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) issued a report making recommendations for safer practice. 1 These updated guidelines take into consideration the recommendations from this report and describe the technique of pleural aspiration and Seldinger chest drain insertion and ultrasound guidance. Much of this guideline consists of descriptions of how to do these procedures but, where possible, advice is given when evidence is available.",

( U )\nBefore undertaking an invasive pleural procedure, all operators should be appropriately trained and have been initially supervised by an experienced trainer. Many of the complications described in the NPSA report were the result of inadequate training or supervision. A recent survey of UK NHS Trusts showed that the majority did not have a formal training policy for chest drain insertion in 2008. 2\nStudies of clinical practice have shown that there is a wide variation in the knowledge and skills of doctors inserting chest drains. In a published study 3 where doctors were asked to indicate where they would insert a chest drain, 45% indicated they would insert the drain outside of the safety triangle, with the majority of incorrect answers being too low. Knowledge of the correct position was higher in the group with cardiothoracic surgery experience and higher in doctors with competence to insert drains without supervision.\nTraining should include a theoretical component describing the risks and technique, as outlined in this document, prior to assessed manikin practice and /uniFB01 nally supervised procedure until considered competent. In the UK it is currently part of the\ncurriculum for core medical training and trainees should be expected to describe the procedure and complications in an examination. The trainee should ensure each procedure is documented in their log book and signed by the trainer. A Directly Observed Practice (DOP) assessment should be completed in support of this.\nStudies of training involving didactic lectures, manikin practice and following protocols, including use of sedation and anaesthesia, have shown the risk of complications and patient pain and anxiety can be reduced 4 and trainee knowledge and con /uniFB01 -dence in the procedures may be increased. 5\nThe use of simulators has been compared with the use of animal models for blunt dissection as part of ATLS training. Forty-one trainees and 21 experts were asked to evaluate a simulator compared with an animal model and they were found to be equivalent in most areas apart from anatomical landmarks where the simulator was superior and the blunt dissection where the animal model was superior. 6\nTraining for thoracic ultrasound should follow the principles set out by the Royal College of Radiologists and is described in greater detail later in this document.\nThese guidelines will aid the training of junior doctors in these procedures and should be readily available for consultation by all doctors likely to be required to carry out pleural aspiration or chest tube insertion. An algorithm for the insertion of a chest drain is shown in /uniFB01 gure 1.",

A /uniFB01 xed effects metaanalysis calculation of the complication frequency across all the studies examined according to these two factors is shown in table 1.\nOther factors such as the needle size used and the volume of /uniFB02 uid aspirated have been shown in a few studies to have an effect and are discussed below. Underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 8 , previous radiotherapy 9 and previous pleural aspiration 10 have also been suggested as risk factors in individual studies and more evidence is required before recommendations can be made.\nIn many studies pneumothorax is the most commonly occurring complication following pleural aspiration, but the pathophysiology of post-aspiration pneumothorax is likely to be multifactorial. Some pneumothoraces are undoubtedly caused by lung injury or introduction of air during the procedure. However, Boland et al , in a retrospective study of 512 pleural /uniFB02 uid aspirations, found that 17 of the 29 pneumothoraces requiring catheter drainage did not resolve with drainage. They termed this an ' ex vacuo ' pneumothorax. All of the 17 patients had malignant parenchymal lung disease. Interestingly, despite the presence of the ex vacuo pneumothorax, 14 of the patients found an improvement of their dyspnoea after the aspiration of their pleural effusion. 11\nThe authors concluded that these pneumothoraces occurred due to unexpandable lung underlying the pleural effusion d what many sources refer to as ' trapped lung ' . The aspiration of the pleural /uniFB02 uid then causes signi /uniFB01 cantly low pressure within the pleural space and air is drawn in. The mechanism by which this occurs has not been fully determined. Other authors have supported this view. 12\nPonrartana et al con /uniFB01 rmed the /uniFB01 nding that chest drain insertion as a treatment of an ex vacuo pneumothorax is unlikely to be helpful in decreasing the size of the pneumothorax. They also found that the presence of an ex vacuo pneumothorax in the context of malignant disease is associated with a poor prognosis. 13\nWe conclude that, if an ex vacuo pneumothorax occurs after drainage of a pleural effusion due to non-expansile or trapped lung, the pneumothorax should not routinely be drained. Drainage of the pleural effusion if it recurs may bring symptomatic relief. Indwelling pleural catheters may be useful in this context.\nOnly one case of injury to a solid viscus was found in the context of a cohort or case series, 14 although several examples of other visceral injuries are published in case reports. Despite the low reported frequency, studies of the accuracy of clinically placed pleural aspiration sites have revealed signi /uniFB01 cant potential for visceral injury 15 16 and this is discussed further in the section on image guidance (below).",

      "content": "< A recent chest radiograph should be available prior to performing a pleural aspiration. ( U )\n< Thoracic ultrasound guidance is strongly recommended for all pleural procedures for pleural /uniFB02 uid. (B)\n< The marking of a site using thoracic ultrasound for subsequent remote aspiration or chest drain insertion is not recommended except for large pleural effusions. (C)\nA recent chest x-ray is necessary to con /uniFB01 rm the indication for the procedure and the side of the pathology. This should be correlated with the clinical signs. The only exception should be the case of a tension pneumothorax.\nUltrasound-guided pleural aspiration is associated with a lower failure rate and complication rate (see table 1). The procedure failures or ' dry taps ' can themselves have further clinically signi /uniFB01 cant complications such as visceral injury. 14 Some studies have shown that pleural aspiration in the hands of experienced operators can achieve low complication rates when conducted without image guidance. 17 18 Table 1 also shows that the use of image guidance can reduce the post-procedure complications even of experienced operators, and a large study of clinical placement of pleural aspiration sites found that inaccurate site placement was independent of operator experience. 15\nThere are four studies directly comparing blind pleural aspiration against an ultrasound-guided procedure. In a small randomised controlled trial (n ¼ 52) the failure rate (a composite of dry tap and pneumothorax) was 33% with a blind procedure compared with no failures with ultrasound guidance. 19 In a larger retrospective cohort study (n ¼ 342) 20 the pneumothorax rate was 18% in the clinically localised pleural aspiration group compared with 3% in the ultrasound-guided group. Within the clinical localisation group were 48 patients with prior ultrasound marking in the radiology department but ward-based pleural aspiration (ie, ' X marks the spot ' ); subanalysis of this group did not show any difference in the complication rate compared with clinical localisation only. Similarly, Kohan et al did not show any difference in complications between clinically sited versus remote ultrasound guidance ( ' X marks the spot ' ). 21 Another retrospective cohort study (n ¼ 523) showed a pneumothorax rate of 10.3% (4.9% requiring a drain) in the blind procedure group compared with 4.9% (0.7% requiring a drain) in the ultrasound-guided group. 22\nA large proportion of these failed blind procedures are probably due to inaccurate clinical site selection. In a study by Diacon et al , 15 clinicians were only able to identify a site for a pleural aspiration in 67% of patients with a pleural effusion. In the cohort where a site was identi /uniFB01 ed, 15% were inaccurate and would have resulted in puncture of the lung, liver or spleen. Where the clinician was unable to identify a site for aspiration, ultrasound localised a suitable site for aspiration in 54%. Overall,\nThe calculations and references used in this table are shown in appendix 1 in the online supplement. 132 e 134\n0699. Protected by copyright.\nultrasound prevented potential organ puncture in 10% of the procedures and increased the rate of accurate sites by 26%.\nThoracic ultrasound or other imaging is very important following a failed blind pleural aspiration. In a study of 26 patients who had a failed clinically-guided pleural aspiration, 38% had the procedure performed at the incorrect site, 31% had no pleural /uniFB02 uid present, 11% had loculations and 11% had intervening parenchymal consolidation or tumour. Factors associated with failure were a small pleural effusion, loculations and a sharp costophrenic angle on the chest x-ray. Operator inexperience was not associated with failure. Ultrasound-guided pleural aspiration was subsequently successful in 15 of the 17 patients in whom it was attempted. 16 Similarly, Kohan et al demonstrated the ef /uniFB01 cacy of ultrasound-guided pleural aspiration following failed clinical procedures. 21 Therefore, if a clinically localised pleural aspiration fails, image guidance should be performed and no further clinical attempts should be made.\nThoracic ultrasound is also useful in the presence of unilateral ' white-out ' or opaque hemithorax on the chest x-ray. In a prospective study of 50 patients, nine had no pleural effusion present on thoracic ultrasound 23 thereby avoiding inappropriate pleural aspiration and potential procedure-related injury.\nIt could be argued that thoracic ultrasound may not be necessary when aspirating a large pleural effusion that does not cause complete opaci /uniFB01 cation of the hemithorax. In a randomised controlled trial comparing blind pleural aspiration against ultrasound guidance, there was a signi /uniFB01 cantly higher incidence of dry taps in the presence of a small pleural effusion (obliterating less than half of the hemidiaphragm) and loculated pleural effusion. There was no difference in the rate of dry tap in the presence of a large pleural effusion. 21 However, even in this instance, image guidance will reveal underlying abnormalities that are not apparent on plain /uniFB01 lm radiology such as cardiac enlargement or displacement, a raised diaphragm or adherent lung.\nOverall, ultrasound-guided pleural aspiration has been shown to increase the yield and reduce the risk of complications, particularly pneumothoraces and inadvertent organ puncture. However, it should be noted that ultrasound may not reduce the incidence of laceration of the intercostal vessels because they are not visualised on ultrasound. 24 The evidence leads us to conclude that, wherever possible, site selection for all pleural aspiration should be ultrasound-guided. Ultrasound guidance is strongly recommended when attempting to aspirate any pleural effusion. It is even more important when aspirating small or loculated pleural effusions where there is a near or completely radio-opaque hemithorax, particularly in the absence of mediastinum shift away from the side of the lesion or when a clinically-guided attempt has been unsuccessful. However, the use of image guidance does not replace the need for clinical judgement, especially when siting the needle within the intercostal space. The use of ultrasound also requires training and expertise as described later in this document.",

In addition, if a vascular or visceral injury does inadvertently occur, the use of a large-bore needle is likely to result in more damage than a small-bore needle.\nSeveral studies have linked the use of larger bore needles to an increased rate of post-procedure pneumothorax, although needle\n0699. Protected by copyright.\nsize has not been the prime focus of any study. A large retrospective study and a small prospective study both demonstrated a signi /uniFB01 cantly higher pneumothorax rate after pleural aspirations performed with needle sizes larger than 20G. 19 20 However, a non-randomised prospective study of three different needle types which were different sizes found no difference in the postprocedure pneumothorax rate. 10\nTwo other retrospective studies found an increased rate of post-procedure pneumothorax when using larger bore needles. However, both studies were confounded because the larger needles were used to aspirate larger volumes of pleural /uniFB02 uid which itself may increase the rate of complications. 12 26\nThe choice of needle length may have to be adjusted in patients with thick thoracic walls. A CT-based study of 53 Scottish patients found that the depth to the pleura was > 4.5 cm in the mid-hemithorax line in the second intercostal space in up to 13.2% and up to 47.2% in the mid-axillary line in the /uniFB01 fth intercostal space. 27 This result needs to be interpreted with caution because the tissue thickness in the mid-axillary line will be increased in the supine position owing to soft tissue falling to the side by gravity. Additionally, the soft tissue is often compressible and so a standard needle may be adequate to reach the pleura even if the depth is > 4.5 cm on CT imaging. Two studies have measured chest wall thickness on CT scans and found that a standard 40 mm long needle may not be adequate to reach the pleural space in the second intercostal space in some patients. One study was in American military personnel 28 and the other was in a Canadian population. 29\nA reference for needle and chest drain sizes can be found in appendix 2 in the online supplement.",

Advice has generally been conservative because of the morbidity associated with RPO and a mortality rate quoted as high as 20%. 33\nIn a retrospective study of 735 pleural aspirations, Josephson et al found that draining 1.8 e 2.2 l was associated with a threefold increase in the frequency of post-procedure pneumothoraces compared with draining 0.8 e 1.2 l. They also found that draining > 2.3 l was associated with an almost sixfold increase, although this subset only consisted of 21 procedures. 34 Similar /uniFB01 ndings were made in other retrospective studies, 12 20 26 although another failed to show any difference. 10\nIt is possible that the association between the volume of /uniFB02 uid drained and the increase in occurrence of post-procedure pneumothorax is due in part to underlying trapped lung. If a greater volumeof /uniFB02 uid is drained, then an underlying trapped lung is more likely to be revealed. This mechanism of post-aspiration pneumothorax has been discussed previously in the section on complications.\nAlthough the safe aspiration of much larger volumes has been documented, it is also clear that complications are uncommon when aspirating < 1.5 l. This is therefore the recommended volume to be aspirated at one attempt.\nIf symptomatic RPO does occur, the mainstay of management should be close cardiovascular and respiratory monitoring and oxygen therapy which is suf /uniFB01 cient in many cases. 35 36 Continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) has been used in a number of cases with success. 37 38 If using CPAP, caution should be taken to avoid recurrent pneumothorax and potential tension pneumothorax if the RPO has occurred following the aspiration of a pneumothorax and there is no pleural drain in place. The use of diuretics 30 39 and steroids 39 have also been described, although there is little evidence to support it and some authors counsel against their use. 36\nPleural manometry is a technique whereby the pleural pressure is measured by connecting a water/uniFB01 lled manometer or an electric transducer to the thoracocentesis catheter via a threeway tap. This enables the initial pleural pressure to be measured and at intervals throughout the thoracentesis. While the initial pressure does not predict the pathology of the /uniFB02 uid, the pressure is most negative in cases of trapped lung. It is proposed in the papers describing this procedure that thoracentesis should be terminated when the pleural pressure falls to less than /C0 20 cm H2O as this could predict the risk of RPO, the value being based on animal models. While there have been no randomised controlled trials to con /uniFB01 rm this, in the cases series described there were no cases of RPO by using this method with > 6 l of /uniFB02 uid being removed. 40\nPleural manometry is not currently in clinical practice in the UK, there are no comparative studies and there is no commercially-designed equipment speci /uniFB01 c for this procedure.\n0699.

In a study of 278 cases of pleural aspiration Petersen et al assessed the ability of physicians to detect signi /uniFB01 cant post-aspiration pneumothoraces. Of the 15 patients in whom the physician suspected a post-procedure pneumothorax, nine were subsequently found to have a pneumothorax. In all nine, air was freely aspirated at the time of the procedure. Only 2.3 e 3.3% of the cases in which no pneumothorax was suspected were subsequently found to have one, and all of these cases used a vacuum bottle to aspirate the pleural effusion. 41 Another study 9 showed that, in 174 pleural aspirations, /uniFB01 ve out of eight of the pneumothoraces that occurred were expected and none of the unsuspected cases required intervention. T wo of the /uniFB01 ve cases with pneumothorax had had multiple procedures. 9 Capizzi et al found that pneumothorax was present in /uniFB01 ve of 54 chest x-rays performed after pleural aspiration for /uniFB02 uid as outpatients and no symptomatic complications were found in a further 50 cases who did not have a chest x-ray. 42\nWe conclude that the physician performing an aspiration can usually predict the presence or absence of a clinically signi /uniFB01 cant post-procedure pneumothorax and therefore a post-aspiration chest x-ray is not routinely needed.

A survey of UK NHS Trusts found that the majority of them had experienced a major complication following a chest drain insertion between 2003 and 2008. There were 17 fatalities reported during this time which were mainly due to misplaced drains. 2 Complications have been reported to be highest in largebore chest drains inserted in trauma patients using the trocar technique. The lowest reported complication rates are seen in studies where small drains are inserted by consultant radiologists. It is likely that complications are reduced by using ultrasound guidance and this has been recommended by the NPSA. 1\nThe most commonly occurring complications in the studies examined are shown in tables 2 and 3. Pneumothorax is also commonly reported, but the aetiology is multifactorial ranging from lung injury and introduction of air to ' trapped lung ' , which is not regarded as a procedural complication (see section on pleural aspiration).

With the increased availability of small drains and use of the Seldinger technique this has now become the most common mode of chest drain insertion,\nsuch that many trainee doctors are not able to insert large-bore drains except emergency doctors or surgeons who have undergone ATLS training.\nSmall-bore chest drains have a low risk of serious complications, as demonstrated in table 2. Small-bore catheters have signi /uniFB01 cantly lower pain scores and analgesia requirements and a greater degree of comfort than in comparable patients in whom large-bore catheters have been inserted for the same indication. 71 72 Davies et al described high overall complication rates (42%) with small-bore drains, but the majority of these were dislodgement (21%), blockage (9%) or pain (5%). 51 Collop et al also described a higher complication rate with small-bore drains (36%) than with large-bore drains (9%). In this study, however, the small-bore drain group was substantially smaller (11 patients vs 115 patients) and the complications were less severe (malposition, blockage and kinking in the small-bore drain group versus one episode of possible lung laceration and a site infection as well as others in the large-bore drain group). 52\nThe relatively low risk of complications with small-bore drains inserted using the Seldinger technique is generally accepted, but there is greater debate regarding the effectiveness of small-bore drains in various clinical situations.\nOne of the arguments put forward for using larger drains is the greater /uniFB02 ow that is possible as predicted by Poiseuille ' s law. However, the maximum rate of drainage possible through a drain is unlikely to be important when draining a pleural effusion when the rate of /uniFB02 ow is usually deliberately controlled.\nRate of /uniFB02 ow may theoretically be more of an issue when draining pneumothoraces with a persistent high volume air leak. This theoretical advantage is not borne out in the majority of clinical cases of pneumothorax where the use of smaller drains ( # 14 F) 44 e 46 48 50 73 had similar rates of success for draining pneumothoraces as the larger drains. 44 45 61 Liu et al compared conventional chest tubes with small bore (8 e 10 F) drains for the management of spontaneous pneumothorax in a retrospective review of a change in their practice and found the success rates to be comparable. Of the 15 patients in their small-bore drain group who needed further management, all went on to receive a conventional chest tube; 4 (27%) resolved with this management and 11 (73%) subsequently needed surgery. 44 Other small retrospective studies comparing large and small drains have shown them to be equivalent in the acute management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax.

Clementsen et al also showed that the small-bore drain group found the experience of drain insertion and the presence of the drain a less unpleasant experience than those in the large-bore drain group. 71\nWe recommend that small-bore drains are the /uniFB01 rst choice for draining pleural effusions.\nThe use of small-bore drains to drain empyemas has a very variable success rate across studies. 45 e 47 78 e 81 The most common problem is drain blockage 45 46 and drain dislodgement. 51 It is likely that the limiting factor when using a smallbore chest drain is the connecting of a two- or three-way tap as this often has a narrower bore than the drain. 76 Davies et al suggest that regular /uniFB02 ushing reduces the rate of drain blockage 51 and studies that employed regular /uniFB02 ushing of the drains with either saline or a /uniFB01 brinolytic drug have higher therapeutic success rates. 78 e 81\nWe therefore recommend that image-guided small-bore drains should be used as /uniFB01 rst-line therapy for the treatment of empyema. Regular /uniFB02 ushing is probably helpful but needs further investigation. More than one drain may be needed to achieve successful drainage. Subsequent drains may be necessary to drain separate loculations or to replace drains that have become blocked. 46 79 80\nLarge-bore drains may be helpful if small-bore drainage fails but, equally, image-guided small-bore drainage can be therapeutically successful when large-bore drainage fails. 80 82 83",

Intuitively, the use of thoracic ultrasound should reduce the risk of drain malposition and complications as the data regarding accuracy of site selection, as described in the pleural aspiration section, is as relevant for chest drain insertion as it is for pleural aspiration.\nSeveral studies have successfully used ultrasound-guided small-bore chest drains in the treatment of pneumothorax, 46 73 pleural infection 46 47 78 e 80 and pleural effusion 46 47 with high levels of ef /uniFB01 cacy and low complication rates. However, it is dif /uniFB01 cult to determine the exact contribution of ultrasound as these studies often used mixed modality imaging including CT and /uniFB02 uoroscopy.\nUltrasound is useful in guiding the insertion of a chest drain into free/uniFB02 owing pleural effusions. Keeling 47 demonstrated that, in a subgroup of 30 patients, image-guided chest drains were 100% successful in treating simple non-infected pleural effusions. The majority of drains were inserted using ultrasound guidance. However, in one patient the chest drain was incorrectly sited within the subcutaneous tissue and was correctly resited using CT guidance. There were no serious complications.\nSeveral studies have shown that image-guided small drains are effective in the management of pleural infections, particularly when the effusions are loculated. No studies were found that directly compared image-guided drainage with other methods of treatment such as non-image guided small-bore or large-bore drainage. Moulton et al , 79 Keeling et al , 47 Cantin et al , 85 Silverman et al 80 and Akhan et al 78 have all used ultrasound guidance to\ndirect small-bore drains for the treatment of pleural infection with a success rate of 73 e 94%. Ultrasound can be used to direct chest drains into the largest loculation or into two or more separate collections when treating multiloculated effusions with good effect. CT should be used if the abnormalities are poorly visualised on ultrasound. 80 Van Sonnenberg et al 83 used the greater positional accuracy of image-guided small-bore catheters to successfully treat patients with empyema who had failed management with conventional chest tube drainage. Of the 17 catheters included in the study, 13 were inserted following failure of standard chest tube therapy (of these, 10 were in the wrong position and 2 were in small locules). Overall, image-guided small-bore drains were successful in 13 of the cases (76.5%).\nThoracic ultrasound is of limited utility in guiding insertion of a chest drain in the presence of a pneumothorax because of the dif /uniFB01 culty in obtaining useful images due to the poor transmission of sound waves through air.",

      "content": "The Seldinger technique to insert a chest tube has become the most widespread method of drain insertion since the publication of the previous guidelines in 2003. In many centres it is the only method of drain insertion on medical wards and many doctors have never been trained to insert a drain any other way. When this technique was introduced it was thought it would be an easier and safer way to insert a drain based mainly on the initial experience by radiologists inserting under ultrasound guidance. The technique can be carried out safely by other doctors as long as they are appropriately trained and familiar with the equipment used in their hospital.\nA needle is introduced into the pleural space and the pleural contents should be aspirated at this stage to con /uniFB01 rm the position of the needle tip in the pleural space. The depth of the needle when it enters the pleural space is noted. A guide wire is passed through the needle which can be used to gently guide the wire to the apex or the base of the pleural cavity as required. The needle is then withdrawn leaving the guide wire in place and a small skin incision is made. The dilator is then passed gently over the guide wire using a slight twisting action. Many of the reported injuries as a result of chest drain insertion were due to visceral puncture by the dilator. Force is unnecessary and the dilator only needs to be passed 1 cm beyond the depth to the pleura as measured with the introducer needle. By holding the dilator /uniFB01 rmly at this depth or using a marker available with some kits, excessive insertion depth can be avoided.\nThe tract is further widened by using a series of enlarging dilators up to the size of the drain. The drain is then inserted gently over the wire aiming upwards for pneumothorax or as appropriate for the /uniFB02 uid to be drained. The depth should be enough to ensure the last drainage hole is well within the pleural space (approximately 5 e 10 cm) but does not require insertion to the hilt. The guide wire is then removed leaving the drain in place. The drain should be stoppered until secured and then connected to a drainage system.",

Using a Spencer e Wells clamp or similar, a path is made through the chest wall by opening the clamp to separate the muscle /uniFB01 bres. For a large chest drain ( > 24 F), this track should be explored with a /uniFB01 nger through into the thoracic cavity to ensure there are no underlying organs that might then be damaged at tube insertion.

Commercially available dressings may also be used which /uniFB01 x to the skin and then attach to the drain.

A transparent dressing allows the wound site to be inspected by nursing staff for leakage or infection. An omental tag of tape has been described which allows the tube to lie a little away from the chest wall to prevent tube kinking and tension at the insertion site ( /uniFB01 gure 4).\nIn the case of a large-bore drain, a suture for wound closure should be placed at the time of the drain insertion. A ' mattress ' suture or sutures across the incision are usually employed and, whatever closure is used, the stitch must be of a type that is appropriate for a linear incision.

The most common is the underwater seal bottle although /uniFB02 utter bags and Heimlich valves have been successfully used to achieve ambulatory drainage and numerous other examples have been described. All drainage systems allow only one direction of /uniFB02 ow.\nThe closed underwater seal bottle is a system in which a tube is placed under water at a depth of approximately 3 cm with a side vent with allows escape of air or may be connected to a suction pump. This enables the operator to see air bubble out as the lung re-expands in the case of pneumothorax or /uniFB02 uid evacuation rate in empyemas, pleural effusions or haemothorax. The continuation of bubbling suggests a continued visceral pleural air leak, although it may also occur in patients on suction when the drain is partly out of the thorax and one of the tube holes is open to the air. The inspiratory swing in the tube is useful for assessing tube patency and con /uniFB01 rms the position of the tube in the pleural cavity. The disadvantages of the underwater seal system include the obligatory inpatient management, dif /uniFB01 culty of patient mobilisation and the risk of knocking the bottle over.\nThe use of integral Heimlich /uniFB02 utter valves has been advocated in the case of pneumothoraces, especially as they permit ambulatory or even outpatient management which has been associated with a success rate of 85 e 95%. In 176 cases of pneumothorax treated with small chest tubes and a Heimlich /uniFB02 utter valve there were only eight failures (hospital admissions for problems with tube function or placement). 89 The average length of inpatient stay has been quoted as 5 h with a thoracic vent and 144 h with an underwater seal, with a cost saving of US$5660. 90 Case reports of incorrect use (wrong direction of /uniFB02 ow) of such valves have been described, however, with tension pneumothorax as a result. Flutter valves cannot be used with /uniFB02 uid drainage as they tend to become blocked. However, in the UK a similar short hospital stay is achieved by initial aspiration of pneumothoraces (see pneumothorax guidelines).\nThe use of a drainage bag with an incorporated /uniFB02 utter valve and vented outlet has been successfully used postoperatively but has also been used successfully in clinical practice. In the case of malignant pleural effusion drainage, a closed system using a drainage bag or aspiration via a three-way tap has been described to aid palliation and outpatient management.

(C)\nClamping a chest drain in the presence of a continuing air leak may occasionally lead to the potentially fatal complication of a tension pneumothorax. A bubbling drain should therefore never be clamped.\nIt is felt that a general rule not to clamp a drain is the safe approach in most instances to avoid clamping being carried out inappropriately by less experienced clinicians. However, many experienced physicians support the use of clamping of chest drains prior to their removal to detect small air leaks not immediately obvious at the bedside. By clamping the chest drain for several hours followed by a chest x-ray, a recurrence of a pneumothorax may be ruled out. Such a strategy, though not generally recommended, may be acceptable for experienced specialists. The clamped drain should be closely supervised by nursing staff who are familiar with the management of chest drains and who should unclamp the chest drain in the event of any clinical deterioration.\nIn the case of pleural effusions, the volume of /uniFB02 uid drained in the /uniFB01 rst hour should be a maximum of 1.5 l. After an hour the rest of the /uniFB02 uid may be drained off slowly. The /uniFB02 uid volume should be controlled in this fashion to avoid the risk of RPO (see earlier).",

It is preferable to perform the aspiration at the time of the ultrasound rather mark a spot for subsequent aspiration 20 as any alteration of the patient ' s position may signi /uniFB01 -cantly alter the relationship between the skin marker and the underlying pleural /uniFB02 uid. 20 21 102 Real-time guidance using a freehand approach may be necessary in small or loculated pleural effusions.\nThe technique of ultrasound-guided chest drain insertion is similar to that for pleural aspiration. The main purpose of ultrasound is to identify a safe site for aspiration of /uniFB02 uid followed by insertion of the chest drain. The procedure is rarely performed under real-time guidance.",

      "content": "< Ultrasound guidance reduces the complications associated with pleural procedures in the critical care setting and its routine use is recommended. (C)\nThoracic ultrasound within the critical care setting is especially useful due to the portability of the equipment when treating and diagnosing relatively immobile patients. Erect and, less commonly, decubitus chest x-rays are frequently used to diagnose pleural effusions. However, these views are rarely possible in critically ill patients. Diagnosis of pleural effusions on supine /uniFB01 lms is much more challenging and frequently inaccurate. 128 The use of bedside ultrasound by appropriately trained intensivists has been shown to safely identify and guide aspiration of pleural effusions in mechanically ventilated patients. 129 Of the 44 effusions that were aspirated during this study, the pleural effusion was not evident on a supine chest x-ray in 17 cases.\nUltrasound guidance is strongly recommended in this setting, not only because the diagnosis of pleural effusions is more dif /uniFB01 cult but also because the consequence of complications is often more serious. With ultrasound-guided procedures the complication rate is similar to procedures undertaken in other settings. 101 102",

      "content": "Thoracic ultrasound is a very operator-dependent procedure where imaging acquisition and interpretation are carried out simultaneously. There is little evidence to specify the length of training required for a non-radiologist to become competent in basic thoracic ultrasound. 130 In the UK the Royal College of Radiologists has published guidelines establishing the minimum standards required to achieve basic or level 1 competency in thoracic ultrasound. 131 Althoughtheguidelinede /uniFB01 nesa minimum number of supervised procedures, it should be recognised that some individuals may require more supervision to achieve competency in thoracic ultrasound. An additional 100 scans to achieve level 2 standard or 2 years further experience at level 1 standard would allow the individual to train others to level 1 thoracic ultrasound standard.\nIn practice, more scans are required beyond level 1 competency to achieve a reasonable level of expertise in thoracic ultrasound, particularly where there is loculated pleural /uniFB02 uid. It is advisable for the novice to start with patients with simple free/uniFB02 owing pleural effusions before moving on to patients with complex pleural or pleuroparenchymal disease. 102 The images should be correlated with the CT scan of the thorax or advice should be sought from a radiologist if the individual is unable to interpret the acquired images.\n0699.
