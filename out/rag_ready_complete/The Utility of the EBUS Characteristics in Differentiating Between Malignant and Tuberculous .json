The ultrasonographic assembly allows imaging of the mediastinal lymph nodes while allowing real-time guided aspiration. Various studies have described the utility of the ultrasonographic lymph node characteristics studied during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA as predictors of the underlying etiology. Most of the previously published literature has focused on the differentiation between benign and malignant mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Few studies have focused on the differentiation between sarcoidosis and tuberculosis (TB) based on the sonographic features.\nIn the preliminary work about ultrasonographic lymph node characteristics, Fujiwara et al 4 found round shape, distinct margins, heterogeneous echotexture, and presence of coagulation necrosis sign as independent predictors of malignant lymph nodes. A systematic review found the absence of central hilar structure and heterogeneous echotexture associated with malignancy. 5 In a recently published systematic review and metaanalysis, the coagulation necrosis sign demonstrated the highest area under curve and speci /uniFB01 city in differentiating between malignant and benign mediastinal lymphadenopathy. 6 Granulomatous mediastinal lymphadenopathy (TB/sarcoidosis) is\nDOI: 10.1097/LBR.0000000000000850 Copyright © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

      "content": "We performed a retrospective and prospective analysis of the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA database at our facility. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA is being performed at our facility since 2012. Subjects with a de /uniFB01 nitive diagnosis of tuberculous or malignant mediastinal lymphadenopathy were included, and their data were extracted from the available records. The data on ultrasonographic features are regularly recorded since the initiation of EBUSTBNA at our center, and the majority of the data was prospectively collected. The procedure videos are maintained in an electronic database, and the same was reviewed if any additional information was required. Informed consent to participate in the study was obtained. The institute ethics committee approved the study protocol (IEC-PG-45/23.01).\nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was performed in the bronchoscopy suite using the Olympus BF-UC-180F bronchoscope, with EUME1 and EUME2 ultrasound processor systems. The majority of procedures were performed through the oral route under moderate, proceduralist directed sedation. Few subjects underwent the procedure under general anesthesia after placement of a supraglottic airway device. Intravenous sedation included a combination of midazolam and fentanyl. Ten percent lignocaine spray was applied to the pharynx. Topical anesthesia to the vocal cords and the tracheobronchial tree was achieved using either a ' spray as you go technique ' or cricothyroid injection of lignocaine solution. Both 21 and 22-G needles were used. Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) was performed by either a cytopathologist or a pulmonologist. A\nminimum of 3 aspirates were obtained from each lymph node station. Glass slide /uniFB01 xed smears were prepared, and cell blocks were also processed. In patients with suspected granulomatous lymphadenopathy, aspirates were also processed for microbiological investigations that included AFB smears, Xpert Mtb RIF test, and mycobacterial liquid cultures. A diagnosis of TB was made if any microbiological investigation for TB was positive. TB was also diagnosed if the cytopathologic examination showed necrotizing granulomatous in /uniFB02 ammation along with a compatible clinicoradiologic pro /uniFB01 le. Other conditions like fungal infection were excluded based on a careful review of clinical radiologic pro /uniFB01 le. Response to treatment was also noted, and patients were followed up for 6 months to ascertain the /uniFB01 nal diagnosis. Although, we did use extranodal microbiologic tests to make a /uniFB01 nal diagnosis, most of our patients were isolated intrathoracic lymphadenitis. Malignancy was diagnosed when the cytopathologic analysis of the aspirates demonstrated malignant cells.\nThe ultrasonographic lymph node characteristics were recorded before lymph node aspiration. The various features documented included size, shape, margins, calci /uniFB01 cation, homogeneity or heterogeneous echotexture, central hilar structure, central intranodal vessel, and coagulation necrosis sign, as previously described. 4,9 Size of lymph nodes was documented in both short and long axis. Lymph node shape was de /uniFB01 ned as round if the long axis/short axis diameter was < 1.5, and for oval node, it was > 1.5. Margins were labelled as distinct if clearly visible with high echogenicity for > 50% of the boundary. Calci /uniFB01 cation was de /uniFB01 ned as a hyperechoic structure with acoustic shadow. Homogenous or heterogeneous echotexture was classi /uniFB01 ed subjectively based on the grayscale appearance and de /uniFB01 ned as multiple low echoic spots within the lymph node. 10 Coagulation necrosis sign was described as a hypoechoic area within the lymph node without blood /uniFB02 ow. The central hilar structure was a hyperechoic /uniFB02 at line often related to the lymph node periphery, representing the hilum of the lymph node. Conglomeration was de /uniFB01 ned as present when more than one lymph node was visualized at a single lymph node station. 10 Central intranodal vessel sign is de /uniFB01 ned as the presence of a well-de /uniFB01 ned smooth hyperechoic wall that was > 1 mm in diameter, located toward the center of the lymph node, and demonstrated blood /uniFB02 ow on color Doppler. 11 The representative images of the various sonographic characteristics is provided in the Figure 1. The\nsonographic features were recorded based on an agreement between at least 2 reviewers. The characteristics of the most prominent and the primarily sampled lymph node were recorded.",

Of these, 547 (50.3%) patients had a diagnosis of TB, and 539 (49.6%) were a malignant diagnosis. The mean age of the cohort was 46.2 (17.11) years. Patients diagnosed with TB were younger, mean age, 37.4 (16.3) years compared with malignancy, 55.2 (12.7) years. The baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The computed tomography (CT) lymph node size (short axis) of the study population [mean (SD)] was 16.2 (7.25) mm, with 15.4 (6.02) mm for tuberculous nodes and 17.1 (8.47) mm for malignant nodes. Heterogenous lymph node appearance on CT scan was more commonly seen in\ntuberculous nodes (45.22% vs. 27.33%). Lymph node calci /uniFB01 cation on CT scan was also more common in TB (4.82% vs. 0.87%). The median number of lymph node stations sampled was 1 (1 to 5). The majority of the procedures were performed under moderate sedation (99.3%).\nThe data on the comparison of ultrasonographic characteristics between the 2 groups are summarized in Table 2. Univariate analysis showed indistinct margins, homogenous echotexture, absent coagulation necrosis sign, absent central hilar structure, absent calci /uniFB01 cation, absent conglomeration, sonographic lymph node shortaxis diameter > 16 mm, and node long axis diameter > 19 mm were signi /uniFB01 cantly more common in malignancy. In the multivariate analysis, indistinct margins, absent calci /uniFB01 cation, absent central hilar structure, absent coagulation necrosis sign, absent conglomeration, presence of central intranodal vessel, and sonographic lymph node shortaxis diameter > 16 mm predicated malignancy. Among these, the adjusted Odds ratio (OR) was greatest for the absence of conglomeration [4.74 (3.15 to 7.04)] for differentiating malignancy from TB.\nTable 3 summarizes the diagnostic accuracy of various ultrasonographic lymph node characteristics to differentiate between malignant and tuberculous mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The highest sensitivity was for the absence of calci /uniFB01 -cation [98.5% (97.1 to 99.4)], while the highest speci /uniFB01 city [84.3% (81.0 to 87.2)] was for the presence of central intranodal vessel for a diagnosis of malignancy versus TB. The overall diagnostic accuracy was highest (0.61) for the absence of conglomeration to predict malignancy versus tuberculous mediastinal lymphadenopathy.",

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "content": "We have described the utility of ultrasound image characteristics of intrathoracic lymph nodes\nstudied during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for differentiating between malignant and tuberculous mediastinal lymphadenopathy. We also report the diagnostic accuracy of speci /uniFB01 c lymph node characteristics, which may have a utility to predict malignancy. The strengths of this study include a large size patient data set, rigorous diagnostic algorithm and carefully selected diagnostic categories that prevent overlap with other conditions. The /uniFB01 ndings of the study are representative of the actual life practice of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA.\nA critical observation in this study was /uniFB01 nding the poor performance of the coagulation necrosis sign to diagnose malignancy. In the initially described work by Fujiwara et al, 4 the presence of a coagulation necrosis sign demonstrated the highest diagnostic accuracy for a metastatic lymph node. Indeed, this /uniFB01 nding may be relevant in settings where TB is uncommon. However, the results of our study indicate that the presence of a coagulation necrosis sign is a more robust indicator for TB than metastasis, especially in TB endemic settings. Necrotic lymph nodes may also represent a diagnosis of metastasis in TB endemic settings, but their presence is more common in TB. 12 In our study, 13.7% of metastatic nodes versus 37.5% tuberculous nodes demonstrated the presence of coagulation necrosis. The /uniFB01 ndings of our study are also contrary to the observations in a recent meta-analysis, where coagulation necrosis sign was the most speci /uniFB01 c characteristic in differentiating malignant from benign nodes. 6 The likely reason being that most previous studies are from low TB prevalence settings. One study described the comparative characteristics of sonographic features of malignant versus tubercular nodes. The authors observed distinct margins, absence of central hilar structure, and presence of coagulation necrosis sign as features\nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA indicates endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration; EUS-B-FNA, transesophageal bronchoscopic ultrasound-guided /uniFB01 ne-needle aspiration.\n50 | www.bronchology.com\nthat favored malignancy over TB. However, the study had a small sample size (46 subjects), therefore with a possibility of selection bias. 8\nStudies from low TB prevalence settings have described round shape, distinct margins, and heterogeneous echotexture more commonly in malignancy. 4 In another systematic review, the absence of central hilar structure and heterogeneous echotexture were associated with malignancy. 5 The comparative group in these studies was benign lymphadenopathy and not speci /uniFB01 cally TB. Heterogeneous echotexture has previously been described to favor a diagnosis of TB over sarcoidosis. 7 Therefore, the /uniFB01 ndings of our study highlight that the results of heterogeneous echotexture and coagulation necrosis signs may be taken as predictors with consideration of TB versus malignancy and necessitate lymph node aspiration to differentiate between the 2 conditions. The sonographic characteristics do not replace the requirement of lymph node aspiration. The /uniFB01 rst differential diagnostic\nconsideration over the another shall depend on the prevalence of TB in the study population.\nAnother feature that has been described to predict malignant nodes is the absence of a central intranodal vessel. 13 However, we observed that the absent central intranodal vessel sign was more common in TB. Of all the sonographic characteristics, the highest diagnostic accuracy (0.61) was found for the absence of nodal conglomeration, which is not suf /uniFB01 ciently encouraging. Therefore, the prediction potential of ultrasonographic features in differentiating malignancy from TB is poor. The ultrasonographic imaging features of lymph nodes studied during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA are insuf /uniFB01 cient in themselves to avoid lymph node aspiration.\nApart from sonographic characteristics, another imaging modality during Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) is elastography. A recent meta-analysis concluded that elastography might help differentiate malignant from benign lymph nodes, but lymph node aspiration is still required. 14,15 It has also been highlighted\nData is represented as a number (percentage).\nCI indicates con /uniFB01 dence interval; Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), endobronchial ultrasound; LN, lymph node; OR, odds ratio.",
