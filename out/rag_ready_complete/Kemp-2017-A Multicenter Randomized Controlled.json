    "abstract": "Rationale: Single-center RCTs of Zephyr Endobronchial Valve (EBV) treatment have demonstrated benefit in severe heterogeneous emphysema. This is the first multicenter study evaluating this treatment approach. Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Zephyr EBVs in patients with heterogeneous emphysema and absence of collateral ventilation. Methods: Prospective, multicenter 2:1 RCT of EBVs plus standard of care or standard of care (SoC) alone. Primary outcome at 3 months post-procedure was the percent of subjects with a FEV1 improvement from baseline of ≥ 12%. Changes in FEV1, RV, 6MWD, SGRQ, and mMRC were assessed at 3 and 6 months, and target lobe volume reduction (TLVR) on chest CT at 3 months. Results: Ninety seven subjects were randomized to EBV (n=65) or SoC (n=32). At 3 months, 55.4% of EBV and 6.5% of SoC subjects had an FEV1 improvement ≥ 12% (p<0.001). Improvements were maintained at 6 months: EBV 56.3% vs SoC 3.2% (p<0.001), with a mean change in FEV1 at 6 months of 20.7 ± 29.6% and -8.6 ± 13.0%, respectively. 89.8% of EBV subjects had TLVR ≥ 350ml, mean 1.09 ± 0.62L (p<0.001). Between group differences for changes at 6 months were statistically and clinically significant: ∆EBV-SoC for RV -700ml; 6MWD +78.7m; SGRQ -6.5 points; mMRC Dyspnea score -0.6 points; BODE Index -1.8 points (all p<0.05). Pneumothorax was the commonest adverse event, occurring in 19/65 (29.2%) of EBV subjects. Conclusions: EBV treatment in hyperinflated patients with heterogeneous emphysema without collateral ventilation resulted in clinically meaningful benefits in lung function, dyspnea, exercise tolerance, and quality of life, with an acceptable safety profile",

      "content": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) is a progressive, life-threatening, lung disease characterized by airflow obstruction that results in breathlessness and predisposes afflicted individuals to exacerbations and serious illness (1). Patients with advanced emphysema remain one of the most at-risk sub-populations. It is estimated that  over  300  million  people  globally  have  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),  with  considerable  dyspnea  due  to lung  hyperinflation,  poor  quality  of  life,  few  treatment  options,  and  a  reduced  life expectancy (2,3,4).\nLung  volume  reduction  surgery  (LVRS)  results  in  improvements  in  lung  function, dyspnea, exercise tolerance, and long-term survival in appropriately selected patients with  emphysema (5,6,7,8). Whilst LVRS has proven effective in selected populations, the  technique  is  relatively  under-utilized  owing  to  concerns  about  the  invasiveness  of the  procedure,  morbidity,  and  the  narrow  patient  eligibility  criteria  (9,10).  Zephyr® endobronchial  valves  (EBV®,  Pulmonx  Corporation,  Redwood  City,  CA)  are  one-way valves inserted via the bronchoscope into the airways of emphysematous lung, and are designed to cause lung deflation (and hence a reduction in hyperinflation) by allowing air and secretions out but preventing air entry.\nBronchoscopic lung volume reduction with Zephyr EBVs aims to provide the benefits seen with LVRS but with a reduction in morbidity.  The VENT study achieved statistical but  not  clinically  meaningful  improvements  in  forced  expiratory  volume  in  1  second (FEV1)  and  six-minute  walking  distance  (6MWD)  between  EBV-treated  and  control groups (11), with post-hoc analysis showing that improvements in these outcomes were clinically  meaningful  only  in  patients  with  no  collateral  ventilation  (CV)  between  the\ntarget and ipsilateral lobes (11,12). Zephyr EBVs have been shown to cause target lobe volume reduction (TLVR) in patients without CV and where lobar occlusion is achieved (13,14).    Clinically  and  statistically  meaningful  benefits  in  multiple  outcome  measures have been demonstrated in patients with heterogeneous (15,16) as well as homogeneous  emphysema  (16,17).  Two  single-center  randomized  controlled  trials (15,16) have reported significant benefits of Zephyr EBVs over best medical care, and we now report the first multi-center study in patients with heterogeneous emphysema and without CV. Some of the results of this study have been previously reported in the form of an abstract (18).",

      "content": "Study  Conduct:  This  randomized,  controlled  trial  (NCT02022683)  enrolled  patients between June 2014 and June 2016 at 17 sites across Europe. The study was approved by the respective Ethics Committees at each site, and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (19). All participating subjects provided written informed consent.\nStudy  Subjects:  Eligible  subjects  were  ex-smokers  ≥40  years  of  age  with  severe emphysema. Key inclusion criteria were post-bronchodilator FEV1 of between 15% and 45% predicted despite optimal medical management, total lung capacity (TLC) >100% predicted, residual volume (RV) ≥180% predicted, and a 6MWD of between 150m and 450m (complete criteria provided in online supplement - Section E1).  High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans were analyzed at an independent imaging core laboratory  using  quantitative  software  (VIDA  Diagnostics,  Coralville,  IA,  USA)  to measure lobar volumes and emphysema destruction by lobe. Heterogeneous\nemphysema was defined as a >10% difference  in destruction  scores  between  target and ipsilateral lobes.\nEligible patients underwent  Chartis® (Pulmonx  Corporation,  Redwood  City,  CA) assessment to determine the presence of CV between target and adjacent lobes before randomization.  The  Chartis®  Pulmonary  Assessment  System  is  a  validated  system designed to assess for the presence of collateral ventilation within isolated lung units. It consists  of  a  Chartis  console  connected  to  a  balloon  catheter  with  a  central  channel which is used to occlude the target lobe, and to subsequently measure pressure and flow  in  order  to  calculate  resistance  to  airflow  in  that  lobe,  and  hence  to  quantify collateral  ventilation  (13).  Figure  E1  in  the  online  supplement  shows  examples  of  CV negative  and  CV  positive  read-outs.  Subjects  who  had  a  CV  negative  target  were randomized  in  a  2:1  fashion  (blocked  design  and  concealed  envelopes)  immediately after  the  Chartis  measurement  into  either  the  EBV  group  or  the  SoC  group.    The bronchoscopy procedure for subjects randomized to SoC was terminated and subjects recovered appropriately as per institutional standards. Subjects randomized to the EBV group underwent immediate placement of Zephyr EBVs with the intention of complete lobar occlusion (12,20). Subjects assessed to be CV positive were excluded. See online supplement Sections E2 and E3 for complete details.\nWhere  there  was  more  than  one  potential  target  lobe,  the  lobe  with  the  highest destruction score and lowest perfusion as determined by scintigraphy was assessed for CV  first.  If  the  primary  target  lobe  was  CV  positive,  or  if  the  CV  status  was  not assessable, then the secondary target lobe was evaluated (for further information, see Figure E2 in the online supplement).\nFollow-up: Subjects randomized to SoC  were discharged after standard postbronchoscopy recovery, unless the treating physician deemed an admission necessary. Subjects  randomized  to  EBVs  were  hospitalized  for  at  least  one  day  and  discharged following a chest X-ray if there were no complications/serious adverse events (SAEs). Subjects were instructed to seek immediate medical attention in the event of symptoms of  a  potential  pneumothorax.  EBV  subjects  were  evaluated  at  45  days  with  a  HRCT scan  to  assess  TLVR,  and  to  verify  whether  complete  lobar  occlusion  had  been achieved. If necessary (TLVR  <50%,  or incomplete lobar occlusion), a repeat bronchoscopy and valve revision/replacement was performed.\nOutcome Measures: All subjects were assessed at 3 months post-bronchoscopy (SoC and EBV). For EBV subjects who underwent valve replacement or revision based on their 45 day HRCT scan, follow-up occurred 3 months after the revision bronchoscopy. Subjects  in  the  SoC  group  were  given  the  option  of  exiting  the  study  following  the  6 month evaluation if they  wished to pursue EBV treatment, or to continue in follow-up until  12  months.  Follow-up  of  the  EBV  group  will  continue  to  24  months  (see  study scheme, Figure E3 in online supplement).\nThe primary endpoint was the percentage of subjects in the EBV group at 3 months post-procedure  who  had  an  improvement  in  the  post-bronchodilator  FEV1  of  ≥12% (protocol-defined  minimal  clinically  important  difference  (MCID))  compared  to  the percentage of subjects in the SoC group.\nSecondary  endpoints  included  comparison  between  EBV  and  SoC  groups  for  the absolute and percent changes and responder rates (percentage of subjects achieving the MCID) at 3 and 6 months for FEV1 (≥12%), RV (≤-430 mL), St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire  (SGRQ)  score  (≤-4  points),  6MWD  (≥26  meters),  modified  Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea score (≤-1 point), and for the EBV group only, the absolute  and  percent  change  in  TLVR  at  45  days  post-procedure  and  the  percent  of subjects  meeting  the  TLVR  MCID  of  ≥350mL  (12)  relative  to  baseline.  Safety  was assessed through review of all adverse events solicited at all scheduled or unscheduled visits.\nStatistical  Analyses:  The  sample  size  calculation  of  78  subjects  was  based  on proportions for the primary endpoint of a ≥12% improvement in FEV1 at 47% (EBV) and 13%  (SoC)  estimated  from  the  VENT  study  (11),  a  2:1  randomization,  80%  power, alpha = 0.05, a two-sided Chi-Square test, and 15% drop-out rate.  For the intention-totreat  (ITT)  analysis,  missing  data  were  imputed  using  the  last  observation  carried forward method. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary NC). Absolute and percent changes from baseline were analyzed using a fixedeffect one-way ANOVA (or ANCOVA with baseline as a covariate) model for normally distributed data; otherwise the Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test was used. Categorical variables were analyzed using a Chi-Square test. Details of the analysis populations in Section E4 in online supplement.",

      "content": "Two  hundred  and  seventy-three  (273)  subjects  were  screened,  with  125  subjects meeting  the  inclusion/exclusion  criteria.  A  total  of  97  subjects  deemed  to  be  CV\nnegative  were  randomized,  65  subjects  to  EBVs  and  32  to  SoC  (see  CONSORT diagram, Figure E4 in online supplement). The median(range) number of randomized subjects per center was 5(1-14). Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups, although  the  EBV  group  reported  a  worse  respiratory  related  quality  of  life  (p=0.042) and absolute but not percent predicted FEV1 (p=0.008). See Table 1 and Table E1 in online supplement.\nTreatment details: A median of 4 valves (range 2 to 8) per subject were implanted in the 65 EBV subjects. Treatment distributions were 52% left upper lobe, 22% left lower lobe, 15% right  upper  lobe,  8%  right  upper  and  right  middle  lobe  combined,  and  3%  right lower lobe. The median hospital stay for the treatment visit was 4 days (range 1 to 49 days) for the EBV group and 1 day (range 1 to 3 days) for the SoC group. At 45 days post-procedure, 89.8% of subjects achieved a TLVR of ≥350ml, with a mean of 1.09 ± 0.62L  (p<0.001).  Individual  subject  TLVR  changes  are  provided  in  Figure  E5  in  the online supplement. Eighteen subjects underwent a repeat bronchoscopy, 17 of whom had a revision procedure, and 12 of those subsequently developed significant TLVR.\nPrimary  outcome:  At  3  months  post-procedure,  responder  rates  (≥12%  improvement from baseline in FEV1) in the ITT population were 55.4% in the EBV group and 6.5% in the  SoC  group  (p<0.001),  and  for  the  per  protocol  (PP)  population  were  66.7%  and 6.7%, respectively (p<0.001). These differences were maintained at 6 months: ITT (EBV vs  SoC)  56.3%  vs  3.2%  (p<0.001),  and  PP  66.3%  vs  3.3%  (p<0.001),  respectively (Figure 1).\nSecondary outcomes:  Statistically and clinically significant improvements from baseline were seen at both 3 and 6 months in the EBV group compared to the SoC group for FEV1  (Figure  2a),  6MWD  (Figure  2b),  and  SGRQ  score  (Figure  2c).  There  was  a decrease in RV (p<0.001, Figure 2d) and BODE Index (points, p<0.001, Figure 2e) in the EBV vs SoC group at both 3 and 6 months. The absolute and percent changes from baseline at 6 months are summarized in Table 2. Changes from baseline for EBV and SoC groups and differences between groups for the changes for the PP population are provided in Tables E2 to E9 in online supplement.\nFor each outcome measure, a significantly greater number of subjects in the EBV group met Odds ratio (or) exceeded the MCID (Table 3, and Table E10, and Figures E6, E7, and E8 in online supplement). In post-hoc analysis, 76.9% of the ITT population and 90.2% of the PP population achieved the MCID for at least one of FEV1, 6MWD, and SGRQ at 6 months.  Following the 6 month evaluation, 30 of the 32 SoC subjects exited the study and opted for EBV treatment.\nSafety outcomes: At 6 months, there were 44 respiratory related SAEs in 31 (47.7%) subjects in the EBV group compared to 4 events in 3 (9.4%) subjects in the SoC group (p<0.001,  Fishers  test),  with  most  events  occurring  within  30  days  of  the  procedure (Table  4).  In  the  EBV  group,  the  most  common  SAE  was  pneumothorax,  which  was managed according to a protocolized pneumothorax management flow chart (21, and Figure E9 in online supplement). Other respiratory related SAEs during the first 30 days in the EBV group included dyspnea (7.7%), Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation (4.6%), and pneumonia (4.6%). A summary of all respiratory and non-respiratory adverse events is provided in Tables E11 and E12 in the online supplement.\nPneumothorax: Over the 6 month follow-up period, there were 20 pneumathoraces in 19/65 (29.2%) EBV subjects, with a median time to onset of 1 day. Table E13 in the online  supplement  shows  pneumothorax  rate by  lobe  treated. In  14 subjects,  the pneumothorax  required  an intervention and/or hospitalization and  was  therefore considered a SAE. Pneumothorax was managed by observation only in 8 cases, and placement  of  chest  drains  in  11  cases.  In  one  case,  the  air  leak  was  addressed surgically. Seven subjects underwent a second bronchoscopy for an adverse event, 5 for valve removal for pneumothorax management, one for valve replacement a day after the initial  procedure due to expectoration of a valve, and one for loss of effect.  One EBV subject died of in-hospital cardiac arrest as a complication of pneumothorax. There were  no  differences  in  any  outcome  measure  at  3  or  6  months  in  the  EBV  cohort between  subjects  who  experienced  a  pneumothorax  (n=19)  and  those  that  did  not (n=46).

      "content": "This is the first multicenter, prospective RCT of Zephyr EBV treatment in patients with severe  heterogeneous  emphysema  and  absence  of  collateral  ventilation.  We  found statistically  and  clinically  significant  improvements  in  lung  function,  exercise  capacity, and  quality  of  life  associated  with  Zephyr  EBV  treatment  compared  with  standard  of care. Ninety percent of subjects experienced TLVR, indicating appropriate selection of CV  negative  patients and  effective occlusion of the target lobe following  EBV placement. Of significance, the EBV group had improvements that exceeded the MCIDs for FEV1, SGRQ, RV, 6MWD, and mMRC at 6 months post-treatment.\nPost-hoc analysis of the VENT study (11,12) demonstrated the critical importance of the absence  of  CV  and  achieving  complete  lobar  occlusion  as  necessary  elements  for successful  lung  volume  reduction  with  EBVs.  Whilst  visual  evaluation  of  fissure completeness  has  been  useful  in  patient  selection  for  bronchoscopic  lung  volume reduction  with  Zephyr  EBVs  (15),  the  physiologic  assessment  of  air  flow  using  the Chartis System has been more reliable (13,16). Using this approach, Klooster et al (16) successfully  demonstrated  significant  improvements  in  lung  function  and  exercise capacity  in  patients  with  severe  emphysema  characterized  by  an  absence  of  CV. Similarly, Valipour et al (17) reported benefits in patients with homogeneous emphysema. The findings of the present multicenter RCT provide further confirmation that  patients  carefully  selected  for  absence  of  CV  experience  significant,  meaningful reduction in treated lobar volumes (mean 1.09 ± 0.62L, p<0.001) with benefits in lung function, dyspnea, exercise capacity, and quality of life following  Zephyr  EBV placement.\nThe magnitude of benefits seen in this study are comparable to those observed after LVRS (8), but with reduced morbidity. The mean change presented here in the 6MWD, a  patient-centered  outcome,  is  three  times  the  MCID,  and  similar  to  values  reported from a single center RCT (16). Zephyr EBV treatment has the added benefits of being suitable for both upper and lower lobe disease, as well as homogeneous disease (17), and is a reversible procedure. Valves were permanently removed in 7 subjects in our study with no associated complications.\nThere  were  a  greater  number  of  serious  adverse  events  in  the  early  post-procedure period  (within  the  first  30  days)  in  the  EBV  group  than  in  the  SoC  group  (Table  4).\nPneumothorax was the most common adverse event, and was managed according to published  guidelines  (21).  The  occurrence  of  pneumothoraces  and  air  leaks  is  a common side-effect of thoracic procedures, ranging from 4% to 42% after CT-guided biopsy (22,23), 11.6% for endobronchial coil treatment (24), and up to 90% of patients within  30-days  of  LVRS  (25).  The  frequency  of  pneumothorax  in  the  present  study (21.5%) was similar to other published Zephyr EBV treatment studies (16,17), and the occurrence  of  pneumothorax  does  not  appear  to  negatively  impact  clinical  outcomes (26).  Of note, 94% (30/32) of the control subjects opted to exit the study and receive Zephyr EBV treatment after the 6 month evaluation.\nPrevious retrospective analyses have demonstrated a survival advantage where TLVR is achieved after Zephyr EBV placement (27,28,29). A reduction of more than 1 point in the  BODE Index has been associated with a significant decrease in mortality (30,31) and the difference between groups in the change in BODE Index in this prospective trial was -1.8 points.  This  is  compatible  with  the  recent  report  by  Klooster  at  al  (32),  and raises the hope of improved survival in our subjects. This will need to be confirmed in future studies and with longer follow up data.\nOne limitation of this study is the follow-up out to only 6 months, though earlier single center RCTs have reported 1-year follow-up data, demonstrating the durability of this treatment (33,34).  Subjects in the EBV group will be followed out to 2 years, important for capturing events that may be infrequent in a 6 month window, such as exacerbations or  mortality.      Another  limitation  is  the  absence  of  a  sham  bronchoscopy  in  the  SoC group, since the treatment involves an intervention with associated adverse events and the potential for a placebo effect. However, unlike other interventional devices for BLVR,\nthe benefit of EBV treatment using a sham control has previously been demonstrated (15),  and  patients  in  the  SoC  arm  in  our  study  did  undergo  bronchoscopy  for  the purposes of Chartis examination (although this does not mitigate against any placebo effect associated with actual valve implantation).\nAnother  potential  limitation  is  the  lack  of  mandatory  pulmonary  rehabilitation  in  the period prior to trial entry. Given the randomized nature of the trial, any changes or lack thereof associated with the potentially variable provision of pre-procedure PR should be balanced across the 2 groups, and therefore would not be expected to be a significant factor in any between group differences.\nWhilst there was an apparent imbalance in the absolute FEV1, and to a lesser extent SGRQ,  at  baseline  between  the  two  groups  (although  not  in  the  percent  predicted FEV1), which could have affected outcome, ANCOVA models with baseline values as the covariate resulted in the same p-values as when using the t-test for all secondary endpoints,  indicating  that  the  group  differences  (EBV  vs.  SoC)  are  there  despite  the groups having different baseline values.\nThe  benefits  of  EBV  treatment  for  patients  with  severe  heterogeneous  emphysema reported here, and for homogeneous patients previously reported by Valipour et al (17), demonstrate that EBV placement is an effective treatment option in patients without CV regardless of emphysema distribution. The success of the treatment requires accurate patient selection including correct determination of the absence of CV between target and adjacent lobes, and expertise in the management of procedural complications.",

Planned  to  enroll  78 subjects with heterogeneous emphysema at Study centers in Europe.\n· Potential subjects with heterogeneous emphysema will be asked to sign the inform consent form and will thereafter initially be identified by visual read of a high-resolution computer tomography  scan  (HRCT)  by  the  investigator.  Subjects  underwent  baseline  evaluations including medical history, physical examination, blood test, echocardiogram, measures lung volumes and lung function, scintigraphy, Six-Minute Walk Test (6MWD), and questionnaires including  St.  George's  Respiratory  Questionnaire  (SGRQ),  modified  Medical  Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnea score, and EQ-5D.\n· Heterogeneity was confirmed using computerized software to determine the heterogeneity index (HI). Subjects with a HI (difference in destruction scores between potential target and ipsilateral lobe(s)) of ≥10% and a destruction score ≥50% in the potential target lobe were considered for enrollment into the Trial. In case of multiple target lobes, the lobe with the highest destruction score and lowest perfusion or ventilation as determined by scintigraphy was assessed for CV first. The scheme for target lobe determinations is shown in Figure E1.\n· All  potential  study  candidates  then  underwent  a  Chartis  assessment  to  determine  the extent of collateral ventilation (CV) between target and adjacent lobes. In case of multiple (2)  target  lobes,  the  lobe  with  the  highest  destruction  score  and  lowest  perfusion  or ventilation  as  determined  by  scintigraphy  was  assessed  for  CV  first.  If  the  primary  target lobe was CV positive or if the CV status was not assessable, then the secondary target lobe was  evaluated  for  CV  status.  Only  subjects  with  a  CV  negative  (low  collateral  flow  as determined by the investigator) target lobe and with an exhaled volume of >100 ml were considered. Subjects fulfilling all the eligibility criteria were considered enrolled and were randomized 2:1 into either the EBV group or the SoC group.\n· Subjects  randomized  to  EBV  treatment  arm  had  EBVs  placed  during  a  bronchoscopy procedure (under general anesthesia or sedation) to achieve lobar occlusion. Subjects in the SoC arm received standard treatment.\n· Subjects  in  whom  EBV  were  placed  were  monitored  at  the  hospital  at  least  24  hours following valve placement to screen for signs of volume reduction, pneumothorax and any other side effects or complications and had a chest X-ray performed immediately prior to discharge. Following discharge, the subjects were recommended to avoid anything else but mild physical activity and bedrest for additional four days by the treating physician. Cough suppressants could be prescribed prophylactically.",

In the case of a secondary  valve  procedure,  the  follow-up  schedule  was  calculated  from  the  date  of  the latest valve procedure.
