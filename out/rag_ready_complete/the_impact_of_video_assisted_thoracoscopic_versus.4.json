In general, thoracic surgery (TS) and interventional pulmonology (IP) utilize both techniques, while interventional radiology (IR) places the catheter percutaneously. Once a TPC is placed, patients are instructed to drain their effusion at a frequency based on drainage protocols that are institution or service-dependent. For example, while TS and IP employ a daily drainage protocol at our institution, IR traditionally follows symptom-guided drainage.\nA TPC can generate an in /uniFB02 ammatory reaction within the pleura, which, combined with /uniFB02 uid drainage, can aid in achieving pleurodesis without using a sclerosing agent, enabling catheter removal. 6,7 Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that 30% to 60% of patients who undergo percutaneous placement of TPC achieve pleurodesis. 3,8,9 Patients undergoing more frequent drainage achieve pleurodesis at a higher rate.

The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB14-1676) and the need for individual patient consent was waived. The institution ' s bioinformatics department provided the database of patients after querying the CPT code ' insertion of indwelling TPC with cuff. ' TPC insertion was con /uniFB01 rmed with a detailed medical chart review.\nInclusion criteria were adult patients older than 18 years of age with a TPC placed for recurrent pleural effusion of any etiology. Exclusion criteria included patients with no follow-up after their catheter placement or if the insertion technique could not be determined from chart review. For thoracoscopically placed TPCs, patients who underwent any decortication were not included.\nPleurodesis success, de /uniFB01 ned as TPC removal due to lack of drainage, was assessed within 90 days of catheter placement. 12,13 Pleurodesis failure was de /uniFB01 ned as continued pleural /uniFB02 uid output that did not permit TPC removal within 90 days of placement. A 90-day follow-up period was employed based on prior randomized clinical studies. 9,12,13\nMedical records were reviewed for patient demographics, chest imaging reports, operative reports, laboratory values, pathology, pulmonary, TS, and oncology clinic visits. Data collected during TPC placement included age, sex, race, and body mass index. TPC-related data included the reason for placement, the date of insertion, laterality of insertion, the service that placed the catheter, the technique of placement (percutaneous or thoracoscopic), and the number of prior thoracenteses. The treating clinician decided the technique of placement. All percutaneously placed catheters were inserted under ultrasound guidance. Oncology visits were reviewed for chemotherapy and radiation treatment history. Pleural /uniFB02 uid chemistries, cell count, and cytology at the time of TPC insertion were collected. Evidence of trapped lung, de /uniFB01 ned as the inability of the lung to fully expand after drainage of pleural effusion, was determined by documentation in operative report /uniFB01 ndings (for thoracoscopically placed TPC) and by chest imaging. The use of pleurodesis agents or pleural biopsies during thoracoscopically placed TPCs was noted. The date and reason for TPC removal were collected from the procedure or clinic note documentation. The patient ' s last day of follow-up was de /uniFB01 ned as the date of their last /uniFB01 led\nnote in the medical record. If patients had a pleural procedure documented on the ipsilateral effusion after TPC removal up until their last follow-up day, recurrence was noted.\nData were collected and managed in REDCap electronic database tools hosted by the Center for Research Informatics of the study center. Patient demographics were analyzed with descriptive statistics. Continuous variables between the pleurodesis success and failure groups were compared with the Mann-Whitney U test. The KruskalWallis test was used to compare patient characteristics among the different services placing TPC. When appropriate, categorical variables were compared with the χ 2 test or Fischer exact test. Continuous variables are reported as median (interquartile range), and categorical variables are reported as number and frequency.\nA Cox proportional hazards regression model evaluating the effect of team and technique of placement associated with successful pleurodesis was performed. The model controlled for multiple variables of clinical relevance, including age, race, type of cancer, malignant cytology, presence of trapped lung, and chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Patients who were lost to follow-up or who died in the 90-day period post-TPC placement were censored on the day of the last follow-up or the day of death. The censoring removed these patients from the cohort of patients who could potentially achieve the primary outcome of pleurodesis success. The data were analyzed using Stata version 16.1 (StataCorp LLC).",

Of these, 14 patients were excluded due to: no follow-up visit after initial catheter placement (n = 8) and inability to determine the technique of placement (n = 6). Any bilateral catheter placements were treated as individual events. In total, 312 patients were included in the analysis. Pleurodesis success, that is, catheter removal due to lack of drainage, was achieved in 102 patients (32.7%). No catheter was removed due to malfunction, dislodgement, infection, the patient ' s choice of another treatment modality, or other catheter-related complications. The remaining patients (67.3%) had pleurodesis failure. Among the pleurodesis failure group, TPC was not removed in 163 patients (77.6%), and TPC was removed more than 90 days after placement in 47 patients (22.4%). After TPC removal, ipsilateral pleural effusion recurrence requiring an intervention (ie, repeat thoracentesis) was noted in 9 (8.8%) patients in the pleurodesis success group and 7 (14.9%) patients in the failure group.\nThere was no statistically signi /uniFB01 cant difference between the patient demographics and pleural effusion characteristics in the pleurodesis success and failure groups (Table 1). The patient characteristics treated by the different teams are described in Table 2. We controlled for the differences noted in the race, the reason for TPC placement, and the type of malignant pleural effusion (MPE). At our institution, TS had a more signi /uniFB01 cant proportion of patients with mesothelioma referred for TPC placement.\nOf TPCs, 93% were placed for MPEs. The laterality of placement, the number of prior thoracenteses, and the etiology of pleural effusion did not vary signi /uniFB01 cantly between the pleurodesis success and failure groups. In\n|\naddition, pleural /uniFB02 uid characteristics did not differ between the success and failure groups.\nOverall, pleurodesis success was achieved in 24.9% of the TPC placed percutaneously, compared with 61.2% of TPC placed thoracoscopically ( P < 0.001; Table 3). In the Cox proportional hazards regression model, thoracoscopically placed catheters had a 2.22 times greater chance of pleurodesis success than catheters placed percutaneously [hazard ratio (Hazard ratio (HR)): 2.22, 95% CI: 1.22-4.04, P = 0.009].\nWe also controlled for drainage frequency by performing a subsequent analysis with catheters placed only by IP and TS -services with the same drainage protocol. The analysis showed that even after controlling for drainage frequency, thoracoscopically placed catheters had a 2.6 times greater chance of successful pleurodesis than percutaneously placed catheters (Hazard ratio (HR): 2.6, 95% CI: 1.51-4.70, P = 0.001).\nAfter adjusting for the use of sclerosing agents and pleural biopsies in the success (3 with talc and 25 pleural biopsies) and failure (1 with mechanical, 1 with doxycycline,\nand 12 pleural biopsies) groups, thoracoscopically placed catheters still had a signi /uniFB01 cantly higher chance of pleurodesis success compared with those placed percutaneously (Hazard ratio (HR): 2.04, 95% CI: 1.14-3.64, P = 0.02).\nMedian time to removal did not differ signi /uniFB01 cantly between TPC placed percutaneously or thoracoscopically [44 (35 to 59) days vs 36 (25 to 56) days, respectively, ( P = 0.20)] for the pleurodesis success group. We also analyzed pleurodesis outcomes based on teams placing the catheter. Signi /uniFB01 cantly more patients who had TPC placed by TS and IP achieved pleurodesis success, compared with those that had TPC placed by IR (48.9% and 34.3%, vs 7.6%; P < 0.001; Tables 4 and 5). The Cox proportional hazards regression model showed that in comparing the teams to IP, IR was signi /uniFB01 cantly less likely to achieve pleurodesis success (Hazard ratio (HR): 0.31, 95% CI: 0.12-0.78, P = 0.014).\nIn comparing TS to IP, there was no difference in pleurodesis success rates (Hazard ratio (HR): 0.62, 95% CI: 0.26-1.06, P = 0.08).

      "content": "This study showed successful pleurodesis (catheter removal at the 90 d mark) in 32.7% of patients, comparable to prior published reports. 3,9 The technique of TPC placement was signi /uniFB01 cantly associated with different rates of successful pleurodesis.

The odds of pleurodesis success were two times higher for thoracoscopically placed catheters than for those placed percutaneously by TS and IP teams, even after adjusting for sclerosant administration. We believe the difference is attributable to the difference in the procedural technique itself. We suspect the initial total /uniFB02 uid evacuation during thoracoscopy is a good head start in maintaining a dry space and allows for faster apposition of the visceral and parietal pleura.\nIn contrast, we suspect the gradual drainage of the pleural space with TPC placed percutaneously leads to lower pleurodesis rates. In addition, the ability to break adhesions that may compartmentalize the pleural space during thoracoscopic placement may contribute to the higher pleurodesis rates for thoracoscopically placed catheters.

We believe the observed differences were due not only to technique but also to pleural /uniFB02 uid drainage protocol -where daily drainage has been proven to be superior in achieving pleurodesis success in prior prospective randomized trials evaluating drainage frequency. 3,9 This observed difference was not due to the team or providers placing the catheters. The ASAP trial demonstrated that daily drainage resulted in higher rates of spontaneous pleurodesis than every other day drainage protocols (47% vs 24% at 12 wk) without an increase in adverse events or signi /uniFB01 cant difference in the quality of life. 9 In the AMPLE-2 trial, a higher rate of spontaneous pleurodesis was seen with daily drainage compared with symptom-guided protocols (37.2% vs 11.4% at 60 d). 3 At our institution, IP and TS services instruct patients to follow initial daily drainage protocols. IR ' s drainage protocol is symptom-guided. Our study suggests that pairing daily drainage protocols and a thoracoscopic approach could lead to higher pleurodesis rates and, in turn, fewer days with the catheter in place.\nWhen the TPC has minimal drainage for several days, the catheter is removed in a clinic or an outpatient procedure room. Control of the effusion is either due to achieving true pleurodesis (ie, symphysis between the visceral and parietal pleura) or disease control (ie, tumor response to treatment with systemic therapy and/or radiation). At the time of TPC removal, spontaneous pleurodesis and disease control have not been distinguished in prior publications and cannot be accurately retrospectively elucidated in our study. We suspect that the 16 patients who had their catheter removed but then had a recurrence of effusion, likely had disease control. Similarly, we cannot conclude whether the 47 patients who had their catheter removed after 90 days and did not achieve the prede /uniFB01 ned de /uniFB01 nition of pleurodesis success had disease control or delayed pleurodesis. To de /uniFB01 ne pleurodesis success,\nwe chose a 90-day time frame that has been consistently used in prior studies. 12,13 The 90-day period is necessary for clinical and research purposes to determine the frequency in which an event occurs in a pre-established time frame. Currently, there is no way to de /uniFB01 nitively know whether true pleurodesis has occurred. Whether lung ultrasonography at the time of TPC removal can accurately distinguish between true pleurodesis versus disease control remains to be determined. 14\nThere are several limitations of our current study. The patient populations treated by the 3 teams were noted to be signi /uniFB01 cantly different in race, the reason for catheter placement, type of malignancy, and pleural /uniFB02 uid protein level. TS treated signi /uniFB01 cantly more patients with mesothelioma due to physician referral patterns at our institution. Patients with pleural mesothelioma may experience contraction of the ipsilateral thoracic cavity during their illness, with obliteration of the pleural space and potential spontaneous pleurodesis. Thus, for studying pleurodesis rates, it is important to ensure an even distribution of patients with pleural mesothelioma, potentially resulting in a higher rate of pleurodesis among the study arms. This was not performed in our study, and the study arm with the highest rate of pleurodesis included a disproportionately high proportion of patients with pleural mesothelioma. However, to our knowledge, there are no published studies regarding increased or decreased pleurodesis success with mesothelioma-related pleural effusions compared with MPEs from other tumor etiologies. These variables were controlled for in our analysis. Also, while protein levels were different among the patients cared for by the different teams, there have been no published studies showing that protein levels affect pleurodesis outcomes. Pleural /uniFB02 uid pH and lactate dehydrogenase have been associated with pleurodesis outcomes. 15,16 We also acknowledge that there needs to be more data on the pleural /uniFB02 uid chemistries as there is no standardized protocol at our institution across the 3 specialties regarding consistently sending pleural /uniFB02 uid chemistries around the time of TPC placement which leads to discrepancies in the data in a retrospective study. Therefore, /uniFB01 rm conclusions cannot be made regarding the pleural /uniFB02 uid chemistries and their association with pleurodesis. In addition, because of the single-center nature of the study, our /uniFB01 ndings may not necessarily be generalizable to other institutions with differences in procedural practice, technique, and drainage protocols. The outcome looked at in our study was pleurodesis success. We recognize that there are other outcome measures that are more patientcentric, such as symptom palliation, improvement in dyspnea scores, quality of life, and adverse events from catheter placement, that were not evaluated in this retrospective study. These variables have been well-studied, however, in previous prospective randomized trials. 3,4 Our main goal was to generate a hypothesis triggered by a\nIP indicates interventional pulmonology; IR, interventional radiology; TS, thoracic surgery.\nIP indicates interventional pulmonology; IR, interventional radiology; TS, thoracic surgery.\n|\nclinical practice observation of a faster time to TPC removal in patients who have the catheter placed thoracoscopically. We did not quantify the amount of residual /uniFB02 uid (if any) immediately post-catheter removal. We chose not to do this as not all teams consistently ordered a chest x-ray immediately following catheter removal. Patients had these catheters removed in a clinic or a procedure room. While all catheters were removed because of lack of /uniFB02 uid drainage in the absence of catheter malfunction, dislodgement, infection, or other catheter-related issues, based on the nature of this study, we cannot comment on radiographic /uniFB01 ndings (full lung expansion, partial stable expansion) at the time of catheter removal. Moreover, since IR followed a symptomguided drainage protocol, it was not possible to collect the number of drainages in this group of patients. However, we were able to compare between services (IP and TS) that used the same drainage protocols. Similar to other studies, including large prospective trials, 3,9,17 although patients had education before and immediately after the procedure, as well as during the follow-up visits, we have no objective documentation of the number of vacuum bottles used per week or patient logs of drainage intervals once the patients were discharged, a limitation inherent to studies evaluating such interventions on an outpatient basis.\nIt is not clear from existing literature whether patients with histologically benign and malignant effusions have signi /uniFB01 cantly distinct pleurodesis rates. However, although small, the number of patients who received TPC for cardiac effusions was not evenly distributed among the 3 groups (8 for IR, 4 for TS, and 3 for IP), which could potentially affect pleurodesis rates. Our analysis included all patients who underwent TPCs at our institution during the study period. Due to the retrospective nature of this study, objective documentation of performance status was not available. This may be a limitation, as patients with poorer performance status might have been selected for the percutaneous technique due to high surgical risk, but this selection bias may be simply due to practice patterns and it is not clear whether it affects the outcomes as de /uniFB01 ned in this analysis. Also, in this study, the date of death was inconsistently reported in the EMR; therefore, the last day of follow-up was determined based on the last documented note in the EMR, which either was (1) the last clinic note or (2) the note documenting death. For this reason, we did not separately report these variables. We speculate that total /uniFB02 uid evacuation and possibly breaking adhesions are responsible for the higher pleurodesis rates seen with the thoracoscopic technique, but we have no data regarding the proportion of thoracoscopy patients undergoing adhesiolysis; this will require objective documentation in a prospective study. We point out that reported pleurodesis rates in our study may be underestimated. There might have been cases where catheters were left in place after 90 days even if pleurodesis was achieved (patient ' s preference, delay in follow-up). This problem is compounded by the retrospective nature of our study, as it is challenging to be certain of the actual reasons for catheter retention in a retrospective analysis. The costeffectiveness of either a percutaneous or thoracoscopic technique was not determined in our study and should be evaluated in future prospective studies to better inform clinicians on the most cost-effective TIPC insertion technique.",
