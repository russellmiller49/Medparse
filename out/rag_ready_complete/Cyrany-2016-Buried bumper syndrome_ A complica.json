      "content": "Excessive compression of tissue between the external and internal fixation device of the gastrostomy tube is considered the main etiological factor leading to BBS [21] (Figure 1). The optimum position of the external fixator thus plays a key role: excessive pressure can lead to tissue ischemia, necrosis and infection (as the most frequent PEG complication), and subsequent inflammatory and fibrous changes can cause BBS. On the other hand, sufficient interposition of tissue prevents leakage of gastric content into the peritoneal cavity and peritonitis. These two trends are somewhat conflicting: the risk of leakage is considered to be smaller [21] and limited to the first days after PEG introduction, while risk of infection is considerable and risk of BBS is long term (Figure 2). Firm apposition of the external fixator just after introduction with subsequent release within several days seems to be an optimal compromise from this aspect. Chung et al [19] found more complications in a cohort of patients with traction than without.

PEG was introduced in 1980 by Gauderer and Ponsky [5] as an alternative to open surgery. More than 250000 PEGs are implanted in the United States every year . The PEG complication rate varies from 0.4% to 22.5% of cases [1] . Complications can be categorized as major and minor; some are typically early or late [6] . Minor complications are three times more frequent [4] , with peristomal infection being the most common [1,6] .",

      "title": "DEFINITION",
      "content": "Buried bumper syndrome (BBS) represents a less common but major complication of PEG. The internal fixation device of the cannula (bumper) migrates alongside the stoma tract out of the stomach. The disc can end up anywhere between the stomach mucosa and the surface of the skin. The stoma channel evolves into the abscess cavity with infiltrate around the migrating disc, while it leaves a fistula towards the stomach lumen. This complication is typical for rigid or semi-rigid internal fixation devices, and cases complicating balloon fixation are rare [7,8] . The mildest form of the syndrome can be hyperplastic tissue growing over the edge of the disc or an ulcer below the disc. The other extreme is complete spontaneous dislocation of the PEG tube with the disc. Some authors limit the syndrome to cases in which the disc is completely covered during endoscopy [9-11] , but less advanced cases are also relevant because they can evolve into full BBS without proper precautions.\nfatal fasciitis/myositis, bleeding and BBS, while omitting traction was not complicated by leakage. Stoma tract formation was followed in studies on dogs. Mellinger et al [22] found no complications in a cohort with a loose external fixator. The frequency of infectious complications and BBS correlated with tightness of the external fixator in the study performed by DeLegge et al [23] . Swelling of all tissues involved in the stoma tract can further increase the pressure and must be taken into account [24] .\nRisk factors for BBS can be classified as follows: (1) cannula (material, shape, and axis deviation); (2) procedure (point of insertion, position of the external fixator, and dressing); (3) long-term care (change of the position of the external fixator , dressing, and preventive maneuvers); and (4) patient (indication, comorbidity, medication, and abnormal manipulation with gastrostomy).\nRigidity and abrasiveness (and change of these properties in an acid gastric environment) can contribute to BBS. Small contact area [21] , sharp edges and conical shape pose a risk of BBS. Improper lining, jejunal extension [16] and some types of cannula are prone to deviate the axis from perpendicular to more tangential. The risk of BBS with balloon fixation is smaller but not zero [7,8] . The distance between the external fixator and skin should be 10 mm. Some authors recommend this distance at the time of PEG insertion and without interposed dressing [1,6] , others (including our group) prefer firmer apposition of the external bolster within the first 4 d to avoid peritoneal leakage [21] . Permanent interposition of a dressing or tightening of the external bolster are important risk factors relating to home care [25] . There is a higher risk of BBS in patients with malignancy, bad initial nutritional status (body mass index < 20 kg/m 2 ), with significant weight gain [8,25,26] , in children [21] and uncooperative agitated patients [7,25] . Therapy with systemic corticosteroids or chemo-/ radiotherapy can impair tissue healing and forming of the stoma tract.\nAlthough BBS is considered to be a chronic complication [27] , migration to skin level was described as early as after 6 d [28] and 9 d [29] from insertion. Acute BBS (within 30 d from insertion) is caused by vigorous traction of the cannula by patients themselves (agitation [30,31] ) or by extreme tightness of the external bolster . These cases are probably not suitable for a conservative and endoscopic approach with respect to the immature stoma tract [15,32,33] .",

A prospective study found BBS using computer tomography in 5% (3/57) [38] of gastrostomies introduced more than a year ago. Bittinger et al [39] described an increase in incidence from 0.8% in 1998 to 3.6% in 2004. We should take into account the variability in quality of PEG procedures and underreporting in real life.",

      "content": "Leakage of gastric content or nutrition from the stoma is an early symptom of BBS. Erythema, purulent secretion and pain are symptoms of local infection. Fixation of the cannula impedes further insertion, while the ability to rotate can be preserved. Blockage of the tube is a late symptom, sometimes initially limited to aspiration (valve type) [40] , but preserved patency does not exclude BBS. In rare cases, the internal disc can protrude from the skin or is palpable just below the skin. Inability to insert, loss of patency, and leakage around the PEG tube are considered to be a typical symptomatic triad [17,18] .  BBS can be an incidental finding during gastroscopy for removal or for another indication.",

      "title": "DIAGNOSIS",
      "content": "Gastroscopy is indicated in all cases when BBS is suspected. A pressure ulcer (Figure 3A) below the disc and tissue growing over the edge of the disc (Figure 3B) are typical early signs. The disc can disappear gradually; the involved area may be flat (Figure 3C), excavated (Figure 3D) or elevated (Figure 3E), resembling a submucosal tumor . The mucosa may be normal or edematous. The orifice of a residual fistula can be identified in the majority of cases; discharge of pus, nutrition, rinsing water (Figure 3E) or methylene blue injected to cannula [41,42] can reveal it. Localization of the fistula orifice does not always correspond with localization of the buried bumper itself [43] , we can use fluoroscopic control and perform a 'tubogram' (Figure 4). A guidewire pulled through the PEG and fistula to the stomach lumen can help to guide endoscopic therapy.\nPosition of the external fixator\nThe depth of disc migration in relation to the lamina muscularis propria of the stomach is critical for further therapy. The depth of migration can be estimated by endoscopic ultrasound (miniprobe [9] or radial [44,45] ); transabdominal ultrasound was used previously by our group in a small case series [46] (Figure 5). Computed tomography (Figure 6) can also help to diagnose BBS [34] and estimate the depth of migration [47] ,  although further methodological data are lacking.",

      "title": "PREVENTION",
      "content": "The most important preventive measure is adequate positioning of the external bolster. The distance between the skin and the external fixator should be 10 mm, although there is no consensus as to whether this distance is safe at the time of insertion (without interposed lining) [1,6] , or whether firmer apposition is needed (for around 4 d) with respect to risk of peritoneal leakage [21] . The length of the stoma channel (skin surface level against the scaled cannula) should be measured and recorded at the time of insertion for future reference [21] . There is also no consistent opinion about the need for endoscopic control of the internal fixator during the final PEG set assembly [1,2,21] . There is no doubt as to loose positioning of the external bolster (10 mm) in patients with a mature stoma tract (usually after 2 wk) [1] . The stoma tract lengthens with weight gain and in upright position [21,23,55] and the bolster should be properly repositioned.\nMovement of the upper limbs in uncooperative patients might be managed [31] using special gloves or using a low-profile device (feeding button). Simple wrapping of the PEG can lead to deviation of the tube axis and can initiate BBS.\n'PEG twirl sign' [27] is  an  important preventive measure. Once the stoma channel has matured (usually after 2 wk), the external bolster should be unfastened once weekly (some authors recommend daily) and a PEG tube inserted several centimeters inside and turned 360° around its long axis. The external fixator should be fastened back to the proper (loose) position. This maneuver is not suitable for balloon catheters and for PEG with jejunal extension.\nCommunication among all involved subjects is the key issue in PEG care: patients, relatives, nurses, home-care facilities, nursing home staff, the digestive\nendoscopist, nutritional specialist, biomedical companies [56] and others. At least basic written information is advisable. Some authors recommend systematic follow-up of all the patients with PEG by a nutritional team [10] .",

While inflated partially inside the cannula and in the gastric lumen, the balloon can help to release the buried bumper into the stomach by stiffening the system and simultaneous dilation of the overgrowing tissue.\nA variety of instruments like polypectomy snares and endoscopic forceps can be used [9] .\nBoyd et al [27] developed the 'push-pull T-technique' using simultaneous traction with a polypectomy snare and support using a surgical clamp (Figure 7B). The technique has been used by other authors [26,72] . Some endoscopists prefer a simpler 'pull T-technique' (without external support) [58,73] or some modifications of snare use [74] , like T urner et al [75] (Figure 7C).\nEndoscopic discussion: Ma et al [30] used a needle\nknife for discission of the overgrowing tissue for the first time. Two of five patients experienced complications with serious bleeding. Dell'Abate et al [24] and Lin et al [76] used the same technique in treatment of a partially covered disc. Orsi et al [26] used a needle knife in combination with a push-pull T-technique in six cases, complicated either by severe bleeding or by perforation with fatal consequences. Braden et al [9] used this technique in eight cases selected by endosonography. No significant complications apart from slight bleeding were observed. Bittinger [39] succeeded with this technique in only half of 27 unselected BBS cases; six of them complicated by bleeding. Horbach et al [58] used a needle knife in combination with a pull T-technique in 18 patients. A third of cases needed three or more sessions and therapy was complicated by pneumoperitoneum twice. A needle knife was used also by Rieder et al [66] (seven patients), El et al [10] (six patients) and Köhler et al [40] in two pediatric patients. A needle knife dissects radially from the anticipated center of the buried disc (a guidewire pulled through the PEG tube is recommended for proper orientation), and a sideviewing endoscope is sometimes needed [10] . Similarly, instruments for endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) like HybridKnife [77] can be used for dissection.\nThe technique of the papillotome introduced via a stump of the PEG tube was described by MüllerGerbes et al [78] in 2009 (nine patients), by our group in an English literature publication in 2012 (5 patients) [79] (Figure 7D), and it was subsequently used by other authors [80,81] . The papillotome is inserted over the wire from outside into the stomach through a shortened PEG tube. While bending and pulling the papillotome slightly from the outside, the cutting wire dissects the tissue growing over the button; usually in several radial cuts aimed at the most prominent bulging.\nArgon plasma coagulation can be also used for destruction of the overgrowing tissue [45] .\nNovel techniques of NOTES (natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery) are also described in the treatment of BBS [82] .",

Choice of the method of release is based on the type of the PEG set and depth of disc migration.\nSystems with a balloon or other soft retention devices and discs which have migrated to the skin level can be drawn out either itself or with a new set pulled through (with a small skin incision under local anesthesia if needed). Marginal overgrowth is usually resolved by simple repositioning of the tube deeper into the stomach. There is no consistent opinion on the variety of cases between the above-mentioned extremes. Only Braden et al [9] evaluated the depth of migration systematically in their study using a miniprobe endoscopic ultrasound. Ulla et al [45] defined the lamina muscularis propria as a virtual border between endoscopic and surgical therapy. Abdominal ultrasound was used for assessment of the depth of migration in our small case series [46] and our BBS classification system [90] is based on it (T able 1). A disc retained inside the stomach and completely covered by the overgrowing tissue must be released with some type of dissection technique. A needle knife represents the conventional method of dissection, published in almost 60 patients [9,10,26,30,39,58] . There were several incidents of bleeding (including fatal [26] ) and pneumoperitoneum (without peritonitis) [58] complicating this method. This method was effective in only half of the cases unselected according to the depth of migration [39] and the method appeared cumbersome in some series [58] . Papillotome introduced via PEG stump is a promising alternative, although\nonly 15 cases with complete overgrowth have been referred to date [78-80] .\nThe acute form of BBS seems to be risky for the conservative and endoscopic approach.\nA disc localized out of the stomach (lamina muscularis propria) should be treated by a surgeon.",

      "content": "A new gastrostomy set can be placed directly through the same stoma in the majority of cases [58] . Some authors prefer to implant the new PEG set beside the original stoma [9] . A 'two-step approach' should be applied in the event of significant inflammatory changes (abscess or phlegmon) or the presence of a wide defect after the disc has been removed, while the patient is supplied by nasogastric/enteral/parenteral feeding and provided with antibiotics [52] with adjunctive proton pump inhibitor therapy and local therapy if indicated.\nThe risk of BBS relapse is low, if the patient and/or staff are properly educated, all preventive measures applied (rotation), and risk factors properly identified and eliminated. We can use a balloon type of gastrostoma set, which carries a lower risk of BBS [25] and we can follow up the patient endoscopically to detect early stages of this complication.",

      "content": "PEG is a widely used method of nutrition delivery for patients with long-term insufficiency of oral intake. BBS ranks among the severe complications of this method, in which the internal fixation device migrates along the tract of the stoma outside the stomach. Despite all precautions being respected - including adequate positioning of the outer fixator - this complication does occur and early diagnosis and proper management should be offered to afflicted patients with major emphasis on ethical considerations. BBS can be managed conservatively, surgically or endoscopically in many variations. Proper patient selection and dissection of the overgrowing tissue are the major\n1 Disc represents all the internal part of the cannula including possible central knob; 2 Critical components of the classification.\ndeterminants for successful endoscopic therapy.",
