      "content": "Chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD))  is currently the fourth leading cause of death in the world [1] and projected to be the third leading cause of death by 2020.  In  China,  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  has  become  a  leading  cause  of morbidity and mortality, with tobacco smoke, air pollution, smoke from biofuels, and occupational biohazards being the major risk factors [2]. Moreover, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) poses a high economic burden, with the total expenditure per patient costing 40% of an average family income in urban areas of China [3].\nCurrent treatment guidelines for stable Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) include lifestyle modification, physical rehabilitation, and pharmacological treatment, but have ultimately failed to reverse the anatomical hyperinflation resulting in emphysema and thus to halt the progression of the disease [4]. The National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT) studied  lung  volume  reduction  surgery  (LVRS)  and  established that LVRS improved survival in addition to health status,  dyspnea,  exercise  capacity,  and  lung  function when compared to medical treatment, with benefits restricted to the subgroup of patients with non-lower lobe predominant emphysema and low baseline exercise capacity. However, surgery was associated with significant morbidity and mortality [5], and this has not changed despite newer data on LVRS since the NETT [6].\nMore  recently,  minimally  invasive  bronchoscopic methods  to  treat  emphysema  have  included  one-way valves placed in the airways to block aeration to the hyperinflated portions of the lung in order to reduce the volume of the targeted lobe and thereby provide benefits that are comparable with LVRS [7]. The initial bronchoscopic valve studies were promising, but failed to meet their endpoints; however, subgroup analysis of the data did identify a subset of patients with complete interlobar fissure (i.e., little or no collateral ventilation) and heterogeneous distribution of emphysema in whom there was clinically significant benefit with valve therapy [8]. Subsequent studies (BeLieVeR-HIFi, STELVIO) have demonstrated effectiveness in this selected emphysema population [9, 10] and have provided compelling enough results  to  warrant  the  inclusion  of  bronchoscopic  lung volume reduction as a treatment option in the Global Initiative  for  Chronic  Obstructive  Lung  Disease  (GOLD) guidelines [1].\nThe objective of the REACH ( R esearch to Assess SVS [Spiration ® Valve  System]  Safety  and  Effectiveness  for the Treatment of Severe E mphysem a in Ch ina) trial was to  demonstrate  the  ability  of  the  SVS  (Spiration  Inc./\nOlympus Respiratory America, Redmond, WA, USA) to be  safely  deployed  in  selected  airways  and  to  improve lung function in Chinese subjects suffering from severe emphysema.",

      "content": "Trial Design and Participants\nREACH is a prospective, multicenter, unblinded, randomized, parallel assignment study comparing subjects treated with medical management and the SVS (treatment group) against those who received medical management alone (control group) with an allocation  ratio  of  2: 1,  respectively.  All  subjects  were  required  to have a 6-week run-in period where they achieved treatment stability without Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation. The study was undertaken at 12 clinical sites in China.\nPatients  with  severe  dyspnea  (modified  Medical  Research Council  [mMRC]  scale ≥ 2),  severe  airflow  obstruction  (postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV1] ≤ 45%), and hyperinflation  (total  lung  capacity ≥ 100% and residual  volume ≥ 150%) were eligible to participate in the study. All prior pulmonary function test criteria are percentages of predicted values.\nHigh-resolution CT (HRCT) pulmonary imaging was used to ensure  the  following  inclusion  criteria:  a  highly  diseased  target lobe ( ≥ 40% emphysema involvement), high heterogeneity compared to the ipsilateral lobe ( ≥ 15% difference), and an intact interlobar fissure ( ≥ 90% complete). Visual assessment of HRCT imaging was independently evaluated by both the lead clinical site (The First  Affiliated  Hospital  of  Guangzhou)  and  a  core  laboratory (MedQIA, Los Angeles, CA, USA). Screening/baseline CT imaging from all sites was assessed by these same two reviewers to ensure consistency across the study sites. Concordant eligibility and target lobe determination was relayed to the study site. Any reviewer disagreement was arbitrated with the aid of quantitative CT (QCT) software (Apollo; VIDA, Coralville, IA, USA) using -920 Hounsfield units as a threshold. If more than one eligible lobe was identified, priority was given to fissure completeness, disease severity, and then heterogeneity to pick the target designated as primary. The site investigator could target the alternate lobe if the primary was too articulated for treatment.\nA computer-generated randomization schema with a random permuted block size of 6 stratified by site was created by an independent group (the contract research organization for the study), assigned study-wide, and distributed among the 12 sites via signed and dated, opaque envelopes. To reduce selection bias, the envelopes were secured and kept by the study coordinator at each site, and the block size was not revealed to the study investigators. Randomization occurred only after a potential subject had met all the eligibility criteria for the study.",

      "title": "SVS and Procedure",
      "content": "The SVS is an umbrella-shaped, one-way valve that limits airflow into targeted airways distal to the valve, but allows mucus and air movement in the proximal direction and, if needed, is removable (Fig. 1). Airways were measured using a calibrated balloon catheter to determine appropriate valve size (5, 6, or 7 mm in diameter). Valves were then placed in the airways by catheter delivery through a flexible bronchoscope. Bronchoscopy could be per-\nformed under either general anesthesia, deep sedation, and ventilatory support or moderate sedation, according to the procedures at  each  site.  Prophylactic  antibiotics  were  administered with an optional pulse of corticosteroids during the procedure. If any unexpected bronchoscopic findings with clinical significance were found upon initial inspection, the procedure was aborted and the subject was evaluated for rescheduling. Those subjects unsuitable for rescheduling were considered enrollment failures. The SVS was utilized to achieve total occlusion of the target lobe. There was no limit on the number of valves that could be used, and valve replacement was allowed. All procedures were proctored by trained experienced physicians from the United States.\nFollowing SVS placement and prior to hospital discharge, subjects had chest radiographs to detect the presence of atelectasis or pneumothorax. The minimum hospital recovery duration was 3 nights, with discharge occurring at the discretion of the site investigator. Patients were scheduled for follow-up evaluations at 1, 3 (the primary endpoint for the study), 6, and 12 months. Follow-up HRCT assessments were only undertaken in the treatment group. If  pulmonary  function  gains  were  less  than  expected,  a  repeat bronchoscopy could be performed at any time after the 1-month follow-up to ensure full occlusion of target lobe airways.\nFollow-up of all patients was completed through the 6-month endpoint and was the primary focus of this article.",

The patient flowchart can be found in Figure 2 and shows that of the 107 randomized  patients,  7  withdrew  consent  prior  to  the scheduled procedure (5 treatment patients and 2 control patients), and 1 additional patient in the treatment group was excluded from the study due to a bronchoscopic findings of lung cancer, leaving a total of 66 patients in the treatment group and 33 in the control group. There were no\nenrollment failures due to the inability to place SVS devices in  the  treatment  group.  Three  subjects  in  the  treatment group  requested  to  withdraw  from  the  study  before  the 1-month follow-up due to adverse events (hypoxia in 1 and acute exacerbations of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the remaining 2 subjects), and at the subjects' request all valves were removed in these 3  subjects.  Enrollment  in  the  study  began  in  November 2013 and the last follow-up was completed in March 2017.\nTable 1 describes the patient demographics between the randomized groups. The patient population was predominantly male (99%), reflecting the higher prevalence of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in men in China [2]. Smoking history was present in 97% of all patients, with no statistical difference between the randomized cohorts. Data from baseline spirometry and lung plethysmography showed no statistical\ndifferences between the groups for FEV1, total lung capacity, or residual volume. Similarly, there were no statistical  differences  in  the  baseline  SGRQ,  CAT,  mMRC scale, and 6MWT variables between the two randomized cohorts.

Using a TLVR threshold of 350 mL, 52.5 and 66.1% of treatment patients were responders at the 3- and 6-month timepoints. The rate of complete target lobe atelectasis was 26.2% (16 of 61 patients) at 3 months and 28.8% (17 of 59 patients) at 6 months. Residual volume as measured  by  plethysmography  showed  a  reduction  of 0.42 L from baseline to 6 months in the treatment group, while the control group showed only a change of 0.08 L over the same time interval; this difference between the groups was not statistically significant.\nThe changes in 6MWT and SGRQ are shown in Figure 6 and Table 2. Exercise function showed mean improvements  in  the  treatment  group  at  all  timepoints; however, statistical significance between groups only occurred at the 6-month follow-up when the control group showed a marked deterioration. The relative percent im-\nprovement from follow-up to baseline between the two groups  was  3.0,  8.4,  and  15.5%  over  the  1-,  3-,  and 6-month  follow-ups,  respectively,  and  was  statistically significantly different at 6 months. The SGRQ showed a similar trend over time with relative differences between the  groups  of  10.9,  7.2,  and  10.5  points  at  1,  3,  and  6 months, respectively, being statistically significant at the 1-month ( p = 0.005) and 6-month ( p = 0.007) timepoints.\nThough both CAT and mMRC scale showed trends toward improvement in the treatment group compared to the control group (Table 2), statistical significance was only shown for the CAT at the 6-month ( p = 0.017) timeframe.\nBronchoscopy  for  revision/replacement  of  valves  occurred in 12 treatment patients (18.2%); 2 of these patients\n6MWT, Six-Minute Walk Test; B, baseline; CAT, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Assessment Test; mMRC, modified Medical Research Council; SGRQ, Saint George's Respiratory Questionnaire; SVS, Spiration ® Valve System. 1  Comparison between groups.\nCT was only done at 3- and 6-month follow-ups.\nrequired an additional bronchoscopy procedure for a total of  14  additional  procedures.  Repeat  bronchoscopy  occurred a mean of 81.4 days (range 27-152 days) after the initial  procedure.  A  total  of  29  additional  valves  were placed, with 4 valves removed (3 in 1 patient). Bronchoscopy  can  reveal  migration  or  dysfunction  of  valves  and granulation in the airway, which can reduce the effectiveness of valves. Thus, repeat bronchoscopy is recommended in clinical practice in case of loss of effectiveness after the treatment, and this occurred in 8 patients, resulting in an\nFEV1 improvement of 8.2 ± 3.76 (SE) mL (χ 2 [1] = 4.29, p = 0.038). Although significant, these gains are an order of magnitude less than the treatment group as a whole. The repeat  bronchoscopies  occurred  within  1  month  of  the original valve placement. The average TLVR at the 3- and 6-month timeframes was on average 200 mL less than that obtained by the entire treatment population. Thus, even after  valve  adjustment,  these  patients  had  an  attenuated response  mechanistically  (as  evidenced  by  the  smaller TLVR response), but also as noted in their FEV1 response.\nSafety\nA total of 40 SAEs were noted in the entire study population. There were no unanticipated adverse device effects  during  the  clinical  study.  Table  4  documents  all SAEs in both study groups through the 6-month followup period. The treatment group is further categorized by device and procedure relatedness.\nIn the treatment population ( n = 66), there were a total of 30 SAEs documented in 22 patients, for an overall SAE rate of 33%, the majority of these events being acute exacerbations of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Pneumothorax was the second most frequent event in the treatment group, occurring in 5 patients (7.6%). In 3 cases the event occurred within the first 30 days, with the remaining two events occurring at 60 and 150 days after valve implantation. Four of these events were designated as device- and procedure-related, and the remaining event (occurring  at  day  150  after  the  procedure) was designated as only device-related. Early-onset pneumothorax in the treated population was probably the result of valve placement leading to changes in the conformation of the lung because of acute reduction in lung volume [14]. Late-onset pneumothorax was most likely due to  ongoing  complications  associated  with  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  The length of hospital stay for these patients was prolonged to a median of 16 days, but no valves had to be removed either because of or to treat the pneumothorax events.\nThere were 15 events in 12 patients (18.2%) that were unrelated to either device or procedure, with acute exac-\nerbations  of  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)  again  comprising  the  majority  of these unrelated events. Of note, no deaths occurred in the treatment group. All device and procedure relationship assignments were based on site investigator assessment.\nThere was no migration (defined as major movement of the device from the initial implant location) or expectoration of valves noted in the study by review of CT and/ or X-ray data.\nIn the control group ( n = 33), there were 10 SAEs in 8 patients for an overall SAE incidence rate of 24.2%. Five of these events were either acute exacerbations of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) events, with the remaining SAEs being unrelated to the underlying disease state. There was 1 death (an acute exacerbation of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) event which led to respiratory failure and multiorgan failure) reported in the control group for a mortality rate of 3%.",

By prospectively classifying in favor of patients with heterogeneous  disease  and  radiologically  intact  fissures,  the REACH study has shown that implantation of SVS valves\nValues are presented as number of events/number of patients (%).

These  improvements  in  lung  function  are similar in magnitude to those obtained with LVRS, but with markedly less morbidity [5, 17, 18].\nThe FEV1 responder rate in our study (47.6% at the 3-month primary endpoint) was comparable with that in the BeLieVeR-HIFi [9] (47% when collateral ventilationpositive  patients  were  excluded)  and  STELVIO  (59%) [10] single-center studies and the multicenter TRANSFORM [19] (55% using a ≥ 12% improvement threshold) and LIBERATE [20] (47.7% at 12 months) studies. Moreover, QCT was sufficient to screen responders, without the need for adjunctive collateral ventilation assessments, as required in other studies [9, 10].\nOf those patients in the treatment arm, a post hoc analysis  showed  that  target  location  significantly  affected FEV1 outcomes (χ 2 [3] = 19.1, p < 0.001). A larger study will be needed to ascertain whether treatment of a particular lobe represents a negative predictor of outcome. It is not clear either whether there is a phenotypic difference among the Chinese Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) population, which may have influenced the ratio of lower to upper lobe treatment.\nThe  pneumothorax  rate  in  this  study  (7.6%  in  the treatment group) was comparable to frequencies reported in the BeLieVeR-HIFi trial [9], which also used fissure integrity as a surrogate assessment for collateral ventilation, but lower than seen in the recent TRANSFORM and LIBERATE multicenter trials [19, 20], which showed a 21.5 and 34.4% rate of serious pneumothorax events, respectively. The markedly lower pneumothorax rate in our study may be attributable to a very conservative postoperative care regimen, with patients staying in hospital for a median of 6 days post intervention and exposed to limited activities of daily living, which has been previously shown to reduce pneumothorax incidence [21]. Gompelmann et al. [22] have also noted that with greater emphysematous  destruction  of  the  untreated  ipsilateral  lobe there is an increased incidence of pneumothorax. In this study, the average emphysema severity in the ipsilateral lobe was 34.6%, with an emphysema heterogeneity between lobes of 28.4% (Table 2). In contrast, the ipsilateral lobe emphysema severity in the TRANSFORM [19] and LIBERATE [20] studies was 45.4 and 47.5%, respectively, and this may account for the comparatively lower pneumothorax rate seen in the REACH study. Lastly, it should be noted that the lower TLVR (compared to other valve trials), possibly associated with the relative lack of experience in the use of endobronchial valves, could also have attributed to the lower pneumothorax rate. All cases of\npneumothorax in our study were successfully managed according to published guidelines [23], with all patients requiring a chest drain. Notably, the occurrence of pneumothorax does not appear to negatively impact clinical outcomes in studies using valve therapy [14] and was not associated with any cases of mortality in our study.\nThe present study, with a representative sampling of emphysema  sufferers  in  China,  is  generalizable  to  that population, with some limitations. The trial was unblinded without a sham group, creating possible physician and/ or subject bias, although the mechanistic changes in TLVR in the treatment group would be difficult to attribute to subject  or  measurement  bias.  As  this  randomized  controlled trial was started in 2013, TLVR with a minimum clinically important difference defined as a 350-mL reduction was chosen based on the results of VENT [12] and European VENT [11]. However, more recent experience suggests that a higher TLVR is necessary to achieve a clinically relevant benefit [24, 25]. Only 1 female was included, but this seems to reflect the much higher ratio of males with emphysema in China [2]. The current study was undertaken at multiple sites in China with physicians who had little or no previous experience with endobronchial valve placement. Despite this, there were very few procedural adverse events and no mortality in the treatment population, indicating the relative simplicity and generalizability  of  the  valve  procedure  for  bronchoscopic  lung volume reduction. Lastly, the trial was undertaken before the availability of the larger 9-mm SVS valve, which would have significantly reduced the number of valves used per procedure and thus the overall length of the procedure.\nThe REACH trial achieved its primary endpoint with FEV1  improvement  at  3  months  and  showed  durability of effects through 6 months. In addition, the trial results demonstrated TLVR, indicating that the valve had achieved its goal of reducing hyperinflation in the targeted lobe, an effect that was durable through the 6-month timeframe post valve deployment. The study results also showed improvements in exercise function (6MWT) and quality of life (SGRQ and CAT) parameters. Retrospective studies have shown a survival advantage associated with TLVR and atelectasis [26, 27], and while the significant improvements seen in our study may be a good predictor for long-term survival, this will need to be confirmed in future studies with longer-term follow-up than in the current study [28].\nThe SVS represents a novel approach for the treatment of severe heterogeneous emphysema with a clinically acceptable risk-benefit profile. The recent results from Valipour et al. [29], who also used valves for bronchoscopic\nlung  volume  reduction,  suggest  that  patients  with  homogenous emphysema may also benefit from this interventional treatment approach.",
