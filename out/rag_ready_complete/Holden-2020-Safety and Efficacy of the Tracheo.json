      "title": "Introduction",
      "content": "Tracheobronchial stents are commonly used for the treatment of nonmalignant and malignant central airway obstruction (CAO), tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF), and post-transplant anastomotic dehiscence. Despite a multitude of indications, the most common one is CAO secondary to malignant disease [1]. Of these, the most frequent etiology is lung cancer, but it can also be caused by metastases from other primary tumors or invasion from adjacent organs [2].\nThere are several methods for improving airway patency in CAO with the overall goals of providing symptomatic relief and preventing postobstructive complications. A multimodal approach, which can include ablative therapies, balloon dilation, and stent placement, is usually employed for immediate effect. Airway stents can be used in both malignant and nonmalignant CAO, with improvement  in  spirometry,  shortness  of  breath,  and quality  of  life  [2,  3].  Fully  or  partially  covered  self-expanding metallic airway stents (SEMAS) are most commonly used for malignant CAO [3]; however, stent placement has been associated with an increased 30-day mortality rate and significant morbidity due to stent-related complications such as migration, granulation tissue formation, tumor ingrowth, and mucus plugging [4]. There are multiple SEMAS and silicone stents on the market today. Each has its own specific benefits and disadvantages. We report our experience with a new fully covered SEMAS in a high-volume academic medical center in the USA.\nThere are several SEMAS available on the market, with a thorough review recently published [5]. The tracheal/ bronchial  Bonastent  (Thoracent  Inc.,  Alpharetta,  GA, USA) is a novel fully covered SEMAS approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in October 2014 for strictures  caused  by  malignant  neoplasms  [6].  The  stent  is made of  nitinol  wire  and  is  weaved  using  a  hook  and cross-wire design. It is fully covered internally by a silicone membrane, and the flared ends are intended to prevent stent migration. Stent sizes range from 10 × 20 to 20 × 80 mm (diameter × length).\nTwo recent  small  case  series  have  described  singlecenter experiences of the Bonastent with favorable results [7, 8]. We present the largest case series to date of tracheal/bronchial Bonastent placement and describe its safety and efficacy.",

      "content": "Study Design\nWe performed a retrospective review of our prospectively collected database of patients who underwent therapeutic bronchoscopy with stent placement. All patients aged 18 years or older who had a tracheal/bronchial Bonastent placed between July 1, 2017, and July 30, 2019, for any indication at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA, were included in the study. The efficacy as well as intraoperative and short- and long-term complications of Bonastent placement were evaluated. Patients were identified by review of the operating room procedure logs and Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap; Vanderbilt University, Nashville,  TN,  USA)  bronchoscopy  database.  Variables  were  predefined, and data were extracted from the electronic medical record.\nDemographic information and baseline symptoms were collected.  A  patient-reported  measure,  the  modified  Medical  Research Council dyspnea scale score, was obtained at baseline and after stent placement as part of routine care. The charts were reviewed for airway characteristics such as etiology, type of lesion, and location. Details on stent placement, removal, size, and location  were  also  studied.  Postoperative  outcomes,  complication rates, and improvement in respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, cough, and stridor) were appraised at < 30 days and ≥ 30 days after stent placement. Complications included development of granulation tissue  requiring bronchoscopic intervention, infectious tracheobronchitis  or  pneumonia,  mucous  plugging  requiring  intervention, stent migration, and stent fracture. In addition, the interven-\ntional pulmonologists filled out a questionnaire that assessed the ease  of  deployment  after  each  Bonastent  placement  for  quality assurance  purposes.  The  individual  bronchoscopists'  survey  responses were reviewed.",

      "content": "Each Bonastent was placed under the direct supervision of one of three interventional pulmonologists (A.C., M.S.P., and A.M.), who have extensive experience with airway stent placement. The procedures were performed in the operating room with the use of general anesthesia and rigid bronchoscopy. Measurements of the target airway were performed based on review of the chest CT and intraoperative  bronchoscopic  evaluation  using  an  AEROSIZER (Merit Medical, South Jordan, UT, USA) tracheobronchial stent sizing device.\nThe Bonastent was advanced into the appropriate position in the airway under direct visualization with a flexible bronchoscope. Fluoroscopy was not used. The stent was deployed by pulling back on the release mechanism (Fig. 1). Once the release plunger is past the red line on the deployment catheter, the stent can no longer be recaptured for repositioning.\nAll patients were started on a standardized mucociliary clearance regimen that consisted of oral guaifenesin extended release 1,200 mg, nebulized 5 mL normal saline, and vibratory positive expiratory pressure device (flutter valve) use twice a day. The patients were subsequently scheduled for a 4- to 6-week clinic followup with chest CT. If there were clinical symptoms of a stent-related complication prior to the scheduled follow-up or identified at the time of the imaging study, then the patients were scheduled for bronchoscopy.",

      "content": "Between July 2017 and July 2019, 60 tracheal/bronchial Bonastents were placed in 50 patients, with 27 (54%) of the patients being female. The mean age was 64.9 ± 13.1 years (range, 33-90). All patients except for one had an ASA score of 3 ( n = 32) or 4 ( n = 17). The predominant symptom was dyspnea in 42 patients (84%), cough in 41 patients (82%), and stridor in 3 patients (6%). The etiology of the airway disease was malignant CAO in 45 patients (90%), benign disease in 3 patients (6%), and malignant TEF in 2 patients (4%) (Table 1). The type of malignant  CAO  was  mixed  in  37  patients  (82.2%)  and extrinsic in 8 patients (17.8%). One patient had two Bonastents placed during the same procedure. Seven patients had a second procedure for Bonastent replacement due to\ncomplex tracheal stenosis with malacia ( n =  1),  persistence of a TEF ( n = 2), or recurrence of malignant CAO ( n = 4; 1 squamous cell carcinoma, 1 renal cell carcinoma, and 2 adenocarcinomas).

A multimodal approach was utilized in 78% ( n = 47) of cases in 42 patients, including use of balloon dilation in 35 cases, electrosurgery in 23 cases, and cryodebridement in 15 cases. The most commonly used stent size was 12 × 40 mm (Table 2). There was 1 improper stent deployment, which occurred with attempt of a 10 × 40 mm Bonastent  placement  in  the  left  mainstem  bronchus.  The stent was too proximal and had to be removed. A second attempt was successful. There were no intraoperative episodes of significant hypoxia (SpO2 < 90% for > 5  min), bleeding, airway perforation, inadequate stent expansion, or respiratory failure.\nThe interventional pulmonologists were surveyed after each procedure to assess ease of use and stent characteristics  (Table  3).  Their  responses  were  based  on  a 5-point Likert scale. The release mechanism was easy to use, and the distal and proximal ends of the stent were easily identified on the deployment catheter and on the postoperative chest X-ray.",

When  the  stent  place-\nments  were  analyzed  individually,  65%  of  the  cases (39/60)  resulted  in  symptom  improvement  within  30 days, and 55.9% (19/34) resulted in symptom improvement at ≥ 30 days. The mean modified Medical Research Council  dyspnea  scale  score  was  3.3  ±  1.2  at  baseline, 2.7 ± 1 within 30 days, and 2.4 ± 0.7 at ≥ 30 days. Twentyeight of the 60 stents (47%) were removed at a mean of 74 ± 69 days after placement. Reasons for removal or revision included: the stent was no longer needed (in 6 cases; 21.4%), progression of TEF (in 4 cases; 14.2%), stent migration (in 4 cases; 14.2%), obstructive granulation tissue (in 3 cases; 10.7%), mucus plugging (in 2 cases; 7.1%), stent  fracture  or  bowing  (in  2  cases;  7.1%),  respiratory failure (in 2 cases; 7.1%) (tumor ingrowth and tracheostomy  placement),  development  of  distal  stenosis  (in  1 case;  3.6%),  lack  of  improvement  in  respiratory  symptoms (in 1 case; 3.6%), prior to tracheal surgery (in 1 case; 3.6%), or other (in the remaining 2 cases; 7.1%). There was no reported difficulty with stent removal.\nSeventeen patients (34%) died within 30 days of stent placement, of which 16 (94.1%) had a malignant CAO and 1 (5.8%) had a tracheo-/bronchoesophageal fistula. The most common cause of death was disease progression ( n = 10). There was 1 possible stent-related mortality. One patient died 3 days after a Bonastent placement in the mid-trachea for airway obstruction secondary to lung adenocarcinoma. The patient had presented to another hospital with respiratory failure, likely due to mucous plugging. There were no deaths in the group with stent placements for benign disease.\nThe  overall  complication  rate  was  54%  (27/50  patients) at a mean follow-up of 111 ± 145 days. The stentrelated complication rate was 23.3% (14/60 cases) within 30 days and 52.9% (18/34 cases) at ≥ 30 days.

      "content": "The tracheobronchial Bonastent is a novel fully covered  SEMAS  having  recently  become  available  in  the USA;  thus,  there  is  limited  experience,  with  only  two small case series published. Avasarala et al. [7] reported on 13 Bonastents placed in 11 patients, 6 of whom had post-lung transplant airway stenosis. There were 3 cases of exuberant granulation tissue growing through the silicone covering, 2 instances of stent migration, and 1 stent fracture. The overall clinically significant obstruction rate was  38%.  Makkar  et  al.  [8]  performed  a  retrospective chart review of 11 patients who had 13 Bonastents placed predominantly for malignant CAO. Short-term stent-related complications (within 90 days) included obstructive\nmucous plugging ( n = 3) and stent migration ( n = 1). Four of the 11 patients died within 3 months of stent placement. These studies did not discuss the impact of stenting on patient symptoms or self-reported scores.\nIn this study, we reported the largest case series of airway Bonastent placement and described its efficacy and early (< 30 days) and late ( ≥ 30 days) complication rates. Most stent studies are retrospective or small-sized prospective studies with a heterogeneous patient population or variety of stent types used. Studies also differ in their definition  of  complications.  Additionally,  there  have been no head-to-head comparisons. All of these factors make direct comparisons challenging. The overall stentrelated complication rate of 54% in our study is similar in relation to previously published studies and in the context of  the  previously  mentioned  limitations  [9].  The  most common complications were mucous plugging (8.3 vs. 23.5%;  early  vs.  late),  infectious  tracheobronchitis  or pneumonia (6.7 vs. 23.5%), granulation tissue formation (6.7 vs. 14.7%), and chronic cough (5.0 vs. 14.7%).\nThe 6.7% early complication rate of granulation tissue formation was lower than the reported rate in currently published  data  on  SEMAS.  Use  of  the  Ultraflex  stent (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA) for malignant airway disease had a 10.5% rate of granulation tissue formation, usually  detected  within  the  first  month  [9]. Although the rate increased to 14.7% at ≥ 30 days in our case series, it is still lower than the 19.5% rate at a median of 1.4 months reported in a heterogeneous group of Ultraflex ( n = 118), AERO ( n = 31), and Novatech Dumon silicone bronchial and Y-stents ( n = 46) (Boston Medical Products  Inc.,  Shrewsbury,  MA,  USA)  [10].  Similarly, there was a 14.6% rate of granulation tissue formation in\na cohort of 82 patients who had an Ultraflex (15.5%) or Wallstent (15%) (Boston Scientific) placed [11].\nWe noted a 23.5% late complication rate of mucous plugging. This is also comparable to prior studies [8, 10, 12].  The  smooth  internal  silicone  covering  of  metallic stents has been shown to have low rates of sputum retention [13]. The rates of respiratory infections in our study were lower than those reported in a mixed stent study by Ost et al. [10] and in an Ultraflex/Wallstent study by Saad et al. [11], which were 37.4 and 15.9%, respectively. Although the flared ends of the Bonastent were intended to prevent stent migration, it occurred as an early complication in 5.0% (3/60) of cases and as a late complication in 5.9% (2/34) of cases. This is similar to other SEMAS [11, 13-15], but much lower than what could be seen with the Polyflex (Boston Scientific) [16] or Wallstent stents [17]. We had only 1 case of in-stent tissue growth, which has been  previously  described  with  the  Bonastent  [7]  and covered Ultraflex stents [14]. For the Bonastent, this complication can result from rupture of the silicone membrane that can be spontaneous or iatrogenic at the time of stent reposition.\nThe overall complication rate increased after 30 days compared to that within 30 days. For this reason, close clinical follow-up with CT scans and early surveillance bronchoscopy  should  be  considered  after  stent  placement - even in the absence of symptoms - due to the high incidence of asymptomatic stent complications [18]. Airway stents should also be removed in a timely fashion when clinically indicated.\nSeventy percent of the patients (35/50) in our series achieved improvement of their respiratory symptoms at 30 days. This is higher than the rate of 48% (90/187 patients)  who  had  clinical  improvement  of  dyspnea  after undergoing  therapeutic  bronchoscopy  for  malignant CAO as reported in the AQuiRE registry [3]. This large, multicenter  registry  included  1,115  therapeutic  procedures in 947 patients with malignant CAO and reported a 14.8% 30-day mortality rate. Death within 30 days of the procedure  was  associated  with  stent  placement,  ASA score > 3, and intrinsic or mixed obstruction. The 30-day mortality rate with metal stent placement was 19.5% [4]. In our study, we reported a 34% 30-day mortality rate; however, the majority of our patients had mixed malignant CAO and half of our cohort had an ASA score > 3. The  great  illness  severity  of  our  patient  population  at baseline is likely responsible for the higher rates of symptomatic relief but also poorer prognosis. The most common cause of death was due to disease progression. As with  the  AQuiRE registry,  we  noted  that  patients  with\nhigher baseline dyspnea scores, higher ASA scores, and poorer  functional  status  had  greater  improvements  in health-related quality of life [3]. Potential reasons for lack of improvement in respiratory symptoms were not evaluated in our cohort but are suspected to be multifactorial, such as coexisting pleural effusion or other comorbidities.\nOur study is limited in its small number and singlecenter design. Patients with malignant CAO have a poor prognosis. Thus, the benefits of symptomatic relief have to be weighed against the risks of complications with airway stent placement.",
