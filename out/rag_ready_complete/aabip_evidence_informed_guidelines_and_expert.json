It signi /uniFB01 es advanced disease, usually results in symptomatic patient morbidity, and is associated with a poor overall prognosis. Consequently, MPE leads to > 125,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States and contributes to over $5 billion in health care costs. 1 Therefore, ef /uniFB01 cient management of the condition is of utmost importance to optimizing health care resource utilization and enhancing the quality of a patient ' s remaining lifespan.\nThere is no single best approach to de /uniFB01 nitively manage recurrent MPE. Two of the most widely used methods are chemical pleurodesis, achieved via either bedside or thoracoscopic means, and insertion of an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC). The relative advantages and disadvantages of each, along with supporting literature, are presented and discussed in a recent expert clinical practice guideline published on behalf of the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS), and Society of Thoracic Radiology (STR). 2 These guidelines reinforce the multiple approaches available, which vary based on factors including underlying disease characteristics, prognosis, clinician expertise, and patient-related considerations such as social situation and personal preference.\nNevertheless, due to the ef /uniFB01 cacy, practicality, and safety pro /uniFB01 le, IPCs have emerged as a preferred tool for many clinicians aiming to ef /uniFB01 -ciently palliate MPEs. IPC placement is relatively straightforward, usually performed in an outpatient setting under minimal or no sedation, and decreases the need for future palliative interventions. 3 This offers an attractive and minimally invasive option for patients seeking to enhance quality of life (QoL) and limit time spent in the hospital.\nAccordingly, insertion of IPCs has expanded considerably in the last decade. While the aforementioned ATS/STS/STR document advises the clinician on the potential approach to a patient with MPE, similar recommendations do not exist for managing an IPC once placed. Our objective was to evaluate the existing literature and provide recommendations for various aspects of IPC utilization postinsertion including drainage frequency, management of catheter dysfunction and associated infection, and follow-up care.",

Additional relevant literature was identi /uniFB01 ed through manual searches performed by the panel membership. The search strategies were developed based on a priori\ncrafted PICO questions and applied from January 2000 to January 2019. Details of search strategies are included in the online supplement (Appendix 1, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww. com/LBR/A205). Studies were included if they met the following criteria: (1) publications in English, (2) IPC only utilized for MPE or suspected MPE, (3) clinical trials, well conducted retrospective studies, meta-analyses, or systematic reviews. The following studies were excluded: (1) expert reviews, (2) case reports, (3) retrospective studies or case series with < 50 patients. The search yield was then screened for studies with primary or secondary outcomes addressing the PICO or sub-PICO question. Dual screenings at the title and abstract level, followed by dual screening of the full texts were performed. Third-party adjudication was utilized when disagreements occurred. The studies were assessed for quality based on a combination of the validated tools, determined in advance for use based on study design. The RoB2 9 assessment tool was used to assess randomized studies, the ROBINS-I 10 was used for nonrandomized intervention studies, and the Specialist Unit for Review Evidence (SURE) checklist 11 was used for evaluation of case series.\nThe decision to utilize data pooling to form an evidence-based recommendation was based on the criteria utilized by the CHEST guideline oversight committee. 7 This threshold requires identifying a minimum of 2 studies (RCT or observational) of at least fair quality which meet inclusion criteria and evaluate comparable outcomes or interventions. When this threshold is not met, a consensus-based approach guided by lower quality evidence and expert opinion is utilized.",

Panel chairs drafted the initial suggestions for the /uniFB01 rst survey informed by the evidence and expert clinical judgment. All initial suggestions were drafted recommending the most invasive potential strategies regardless of the chair ' s interpretation of evidence, personal clinical judgment, or expected panel responses to avoid biasing the membership. All members, except for the chair, co-chair and methodologist electronically voted on agreement with each drafted suggestion using a 5-point Likert\n|\nscale with options ranging between strongly agree and strongly disagree. Panelists were not permitted to discuss the drafted recommendations other than in the open comments /uniFB01 eld during the anonymous voting to avoid the occurrence or perception of group interaction bias. The chair and co-chair abstained from voting as they had access to the membership ' s comments before deidenti /uniFB01 cation.

Verbatim anonymous comments, from the previous round of voting, were provided to the panel members along with the interim revisions.

The AMPLE-2 trial compared daily to symptomguided drainage over the /uniFB01 rst 60 days after catheter\n|\nplacement. 22 In the symptom-based group, drainages were performed at a median frequency of every 5.45 days. Difference in breathlessness between the groups was measured using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) breathlessness score. Broader differences in QoL were measured with the VAS-QoL score and the EuroQoL-5 Dimensions-5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) QoL assessment. While the primary outcome of VAS breathlessness score was similar between groups, there was a statistically and clinically signi /uniFB01 cant improvement in the EQ-5D-5L score, as well as a nonsigni /uniFB01 cant trend toward improvement in VAS-QoL scores in the aggressive daily drainage group. No between-group differences were found in pain scores, complications, inpatient hospital days, or mortality.\nThe ASAP trial was designed to evaluate rates of autopleurodesis between daily drainage and every-other-day drainage, but included secondary outcomes of QoL using the Karnofsky performance scale and the SF-36 score at baseline, 2 weeks postinsertion, and 12 weeks postinsertion. 21 It found no differences in these measures between the 2 groups. Overall patient satisfaction scores and frequency of adverse events were also similar.\n(2) Effect of drainage schedule on pleurodesis: The majority of currently available data guiding optimal drainage schedules for purposes of achieving pleurodesis also comes from the ASAP and AMPLE-2 trials. In the ASAP trial, the primary outcome of autopleurodesis was achieved at a higher rate in the daily drainage group than the every-other-day drainage group (47% vs. 24%) at the end of the 12-week study period. However, substantial subject losses to follow-up as well as early deaths in the latter arm introduces uncertainty in this conclusion. Although not the primary outcome, the AMPLE-2 trial found that a daily drainage schedule was superior to the symptombased protocol at achieving pleurodesis at 60 days (37.3% vs. 11.4%). This advantage persisted at 6 months (44.2% vs. 15.9%).",

For these patients, the committee suggests a daily drainage schedule based on the results of the ASAP and AMPLE-2 trials.\nIf catheter removal is not an important patientcentered outcome, the committee cannot\nrecommend aggressive drainage schedules. While there was a small improvement in secondary QoL scores for patients in the aggressive drainage arm of the AMPLE-2 trial, there has been no convincing evidence to date to support aggressive drainage for the purpose of improving breathlessness or QoL. The committee is also unable to endorse an aggressive drainage protocol in patients with limited life-expectancy (eg, ≤ 3 mo) as even if pleurodesis is achieved before death, the remaining time without the catheter will be short.",

      "content": "Wilshire et al 36 retrospectively reviewed the charts of 172 patients with IPCs over a 5-year period in a single center. Thirty-seven IPCs were identi /uniFB01 ed as nondraining of which 29 were placed for malignant or paramalignant effusions. Restoration of drainage occurred in all IPCs following instillation of intrapleural alteplase. After successful drainage, the 18 patients who did not die or undergo successful pleurodesis eventually required repeat alteplase, all of which were deemed successful. No complications were observed in the study. A major limitation was the use of a conservative drainage volume of 10 mL to de /uniFB01 ne therapy success. This is not typically considered a clinically meaningful volume and 22% of those deemed successful produced < 150 mL of /uniFB02 uid posttreatment. The 10 mL threshold was based on the internal capacity of the catheter and the assumption that in the presence of residual /uniFB02 uid a nondraining catheter was only due to an obstruction within the catheter, rather than a poorly draining pleural space, for example due to loculations. A small increase of /uniFB02 uid output would not indicate adequate treatment of an organized pleural space. While the clinical relevance of this study is limited, it does demonstrate the safety of intrapleural alteplase at doses of 2 to 5 mg.\nThomas et al 33 evaluated the use of /uniFB01 brinolytics for the purpose of restoring /uniFB02 ow to a nondraining catheter in a multi-institutional retrospective review. This study used the term ' symptomatic loculations ' to describe a nondraining catheter in the setting of radiographic evidence of residual pleural /uniFB02 uid, with effusionrelated breathlessness and absence of evidence of pleural infection. In total, 66 patients were analyzed. After pleural instillation of /uniFB01 brinolytics, drainage volume increased in 93% of patients, to a median of 500 mL at 24 hours and 900 mL at 72 hours. In addition, 83% of patients had an improvement of breathlessness and there was a 21% decrease of the size of effusion on chest radiography at 2 hours. However, 41% of catheters developed recurrent obstruction at a median of 13 days postintervention. Ten of these patients received a second /uniFB01 brinolytic treatment while the remaining had the catheter replaced. Of those who were retreated, only 1 had sustained effect, possibly suggesting the dif /uniFB01 culty in managing a pleural\nspace prone to organization. The only observed complication was signi /uniFB01 cant nonfatal pleural bleeding which occurred in 2 of 66 patients.\nAs the study was a multicenter retrospective review, the protocols used between institutions varied resulting in a heterogenous dataset. The choice of both /uniFB01 brinolytic agent and dose varied among the 4 centers. While most patients (79%) received alteplase, both streptokinase and urokinase were used as well. Of those who received alteplase, individual doses ranged from 4 to 10 mg and up to 6 doses were given to individual patients per treatment. Dose-dependent and agent-dependent variations in outcomes and complications were not reported. In addition, as some institutions did not collect the necessary data to report all outcomes, some of the /uniFB01 ndings were based on a very limited dataset.\nFinally, in 2016 the largest and most clinically relevant study to date of the effect of /uniFB01 brinolytics on a nondraining IPC was performed by Vial et al. 17 The advantage of this study is that it incorporated a standardized, multistep algorithmic pathway in managing a poorly draining pleural space. In this retrospective review, patients with abrupt cessation of /uniFB02 uid drainage or with reduction in drainage to < 150 mL on 3 consecutive occasions on an every-other-day schedule would receive a chest radiograph. If the effusion occupied > 20% of the hemithorax, the catheter would be /uniFB02 ushed with 20 mL of saline. If drainage postsaline /uniFB02 ushing remained under 150 mL, then 4 mg of alteplase was instilled into the IPC followed by a second dose if initial dose was unsuccessful. If drainage remained poor, the IPC was removed and other palliative options, to include catheter replacement, were considered.\nAs this was a retrospective review, and only patients who received alteplase were captured, the success of saline /uniFB02 ushing alone to restore /uniFB02 ow was not reported. A single dose of alteplase was able to restore /uniFB02 ow to > 150 mL in 85% (83/97) of patients. However, as in the aforementioned studies, reocclusion was common, occurring in 32% (27/83). A second treatment after reocclusion was successful in 72% of patients, and unlike the Thomas study, the majority (87.5%) of patients had a sustained response and did not require a third treatment. Of the 45 patients who had a baseline Borg score of at least 1 and successful drainage, symptomatic bene /uniFB01 t was only seen in 53% of patients. As in the previously discussed studies, complications were infrequent, occurring in 4% of instillations (5/121) with 2 cases of nonfatal hemothorax, and 3 infectious complications.\n|",

In addition, the rationale for single agent versus combination therapy was not provided. There were no complications reported with this regimen.

We acknowledge that the differences in biology between infected MPEs and primary pleural space infections might result in differences in both ef /uniFB01 cacy and bleeding risk. The committee, however, believes that based on clinical experience combined intrapleural therapy for treating IPC-related pleural space infections, in patients who do not have contradictions, is reasonable. There are no high-quality data supporting single agent /uniFB01 brinolytics or DNase in treating pleural space infections. Furthermore, the use of DNase as monotherapy in the MIST II trial resulted in worsening systemic in /uniFB02 ammatory response and more frequent surgical referral. 59 As such, the committee suggests avoiding DNase monotherapy in pleural space infections but cannot recommend for or against /uniFB01 brinolytic monotherapy in this setting. A larger series examining the use of alteplase and DNase in the management of IPCrelated pleural space infections is underway which may contribute to answering this question. 60",

      "content": "Typically, treatment of tunnel tract infections is similar to that of exit-site infections but usually require longer antibiotic courses. 42 However, a simultaneous tunnel and visceral space infection may predict a poorer outcome. In this scenario, the PDC literature predicts a low likelihood of eradication of infection without catheter removal. 61 -63 One exception is the presence of coagulase-negative staphylococcal infection, for which high rates of catheter salvage have been reported. 62 While the indirect evidence favors removal in the presence of virulent organisms, there is no direct evidence to support this strategy in IPC patients. Given the lack of direct evidence and the overall low mortality associated with IPC-related pleural space infections, one might consider a trial of antibiotics without IPC removal, with the understanding that in the setting of virulent organisms failure rates are likely high.\nWhile there is no evidence to guide decisions regarding catheter removal, the committee believes that failure to respond to treatment, suggested by either poor clinical response or inadequate IPC drainage, should prompt catheter removal. Placement of a new chest tube for continued drainage is also suggested in the setting of persistent /uniFB02 uid after IPC removal.",

On the basis of the Fysh trial, empiric therapy should include treatment for S. aureus (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus ) and P. aeruginosa , while broader coverage should be considered, as 15 other pathogens were identi /uniFB01 ed in the 29 remaining patients with positive cultures. 23 Empiric coverage for resistant organisms should be based on both local susceptibility rates and resistance patterns from known colonization or previous infections.\nThe committee recognizes the lack of evidence supporting empiric anaerobic coverage. However, including empiric anaerobic coverage may be reasonable for 2 reasons. First, while anaerobic organisms might be infrequent causes of IPC-related\npleural space infections, they are commonly isolated in parapneumonic infections. 66 Sometimes it is dif/uniFB01 cult to distinguish the source of a pleural space infection in the setting of an IPC, and the clinician should make every effort to recognize a coexisting pneumonia when deciding on empiric regimen. Second, while anaerobes were only found in 3/50 cases in the Fysh trial, this may have been an underrepresentation as the use of inoculated anaerobic blood culture bottles has been shown to signi /uniFB01 cantly increase detection of anaerobic organisms. 67 While the manuscript did not speci /uniFB01 cally address culture method, at the time of the study (2001-2012) this was not yet standard practice.\nAs with complicated parapneumonic effusions, the appropriate length of therapy is unknown and likely should be based on severity of illness, systemic response, drainage adequacy. Whether repeat cultures have any role in guiding therapy duration is also unknown. Decisions regarding route of delivery and narrowing of coverage should likely be based on a combination of severity of illness, response to initial therapy, patient preferences regarding hospitalization, and suspicion for presence of resistant organisms. There is no data regarding the use of intrapleural antimicrobials, however, with the IPC as an easy method of access to the pleural space this is an intriguing question that is worth evaluating further in clinical studies.",

      "content": "In a single center, 6-year retrospective review, Mekhaiel et al 19 compared infection rate in MPE patients with IPCs who were receiving chemotherapy to those who were not. A total of 262 IPCs in 243 patients were included, of which 173 IPCs\n|\n(66%) were in the chemotherapy group. Both IPCrelated pleural space infections and soft tissue infections were analyzed. The authors de /uniFB01 ned active chemotherapy as patients having received chemotherapeutic agents within 6 weeks of IPC placement or at any timepoint during which the IPC was in situ. Overall infection rate was 6.1% of which 3.8% were IPC-related pleural space infections and 2.3% were soft tissue infections. The overall infection rate in the chemotherapy arm was 5.2% compared with 7.9% in the nonchemotherapy arm, a statistically insigni /uniFB01 cant difference ( P = 0.4).\nA similar study by Hak et al 18 analyzed 104 IPC patients with MPE, of which 43 (41%) were receiving chemotherapy. The rate of infection within 6 months of IPC insertion was 9.3% in the chemotherapy arm versus 4.9% in the nonchemotherapy arm which was also not statistically different ( P = 0.311). The 6-month mortality was signi /uniFB01 cantly higher in those not receiving chemotherapy, which can be explained by severity of illness precluding chemotherapy.\nMitchell et al 20 retrospectively reviewed a 10-year cohort of patients with IPCs placed for MPEs associated with breast cancer. In this study the effect of chemotherapy on IPC removal was the primary outcome, while development of infections was secondarily evaluated. A total of 207 patients were included of which 104 (48.2%) received chemotherapy with IPC in situ. Both infection rates and overall rate of IPC removal were similar between the 2 groups.\nIn patients with hematologic malignancies, who often receive cytotoxic chemotherapy resulting in signi /uniFB01 cant neutropenia, there also does not appear to be an increased infection risk. Gilbert et al 65 evaluated 91 such patients with IPCs and found an 8% overall rate of infection with a mean catheter duration of 90 days. While there was no comparison group, the infection rate was similar to those found in other reviews of IPC infections in malignant disease. 31 Only 43% of patients were receiving active chemotherapy and the speci /uniFB01 c frequency of infections in this subgroup was not reported. Overall mortality related to infection was 2%. However, of the 7 patients who did develop IPC-related infections, 2 died from the infection (29%). Four of the patients who survived had IPCs removed, while 2 of the 3 patients whose IPCs were retained died.\nFaiz et al 44 reviewed the rates of IPC-related infections in hematologic malignancies over a 14-year period at a single large-volume cancer center. A total of 172 patients with 208 IPCs were\nanalyzed. Nine patients (5.2%) developed infectious complications. Of these, 5 (2.9%) were pleural space infections, 3 (1.7%) were tunnel tract infections and 1 (0.6%) was an exit-site infection. Again, these rates are similar to those discussed previously. 31,32,68,69",

      "title": "CONCLUSIONS",
      "content": "To the best of our knowledge this is the /uniFB01 rst guideline devoted to the postinsertion management of IPCs in patients with MPEs. Our goal was to provide a framework based on the best available evidence and where data was lacking expert opinion. In developing our document, we utilized the TCBS approach, 7 which results in unbiased, scienti /uniFB01 cally valid, standards-compliant, and trustworthy guidance. However, despite what we considered a rigorous methodological process for synthesizing and reporting the evidence, we acknowledge limitations to our recommendations.\nAll chosen topics for evaluation were felt to be clinically important and potentially actionable. We do recognize that certain topics were not addressed. Some of these topics were intentionally avoided due to inability to de /uniFB01 ne best practices or unclear relevance and applicability to general practice. Examples include the use of serial examinations of pleural cytology or biomarkers to guide interventions, and the role of maintaining a daily drainage log.\nA major limitation of our document is the lack of quality clinical trials to support decision-making. Most of the available evidence is con /uniFB01 ned to retrospective reviews. Consequently, despite our methods, we were unable to provide any guidance with strength exceeding that of suggestions. As such, it is important to emphasize that a lack of strict adherence to these guidelines should not be considered a deviation from standard of care. Nevertheless, we feel our document uses the appropriate guidance\n|\nand transparency for the reader to decide the relative value of each recommendation.\nWe also concede several methodological limitations. In this project, searches were not peer-reviewed by objective medical librarians, and quality assessments were made by only 1 methodologist and not con /uniFB01 rmed by dual critiques. However, the authors believe that the risk of missing relevant manuscripts by not including a librarian in the literature search is low since the body of literature dedicated to the management of IPCs for the management of MPEs is relatively small. Also, through a combination of the PubMed search developed by the authors and the manual searches performed by the panel membership (who are very familiar with the existing literature within the /uniFB01 eld), the authors feel con/uniFB01 dent that the literature review was suf /uniFB01 ciently comprehensive. While dual quality assessments by 2 methodologists is ideal, the decision was made to limit to a single methodologist due to cost restraints. Given the small number of articles which underwent methodological assessment, all of which clearly had high/serious risks of bias, the authors do not believe that this altered the /uniFB01 nal conclusions.\nThe composition of the panel membership is another potential limitation. The voting membership included only interventional pulmonologists and mid-level providers who practice under the supervision of interventional pulmonologists. There are multiple other provider specialties which are involved in the placement of IPCs for MPEs as well as patient monitoring and management of complication, such as thoracic surgeons, interventional radiologists, oncologists, and infectious disease specialists. Consensus opinions might have differed depending on the distribution of disciplines represented but this is unknown.\nFinally, the panel did not include a consumer representative, which in this case would have been a patient with MPE managed with an IPC. This is recommended as part of the TCBS development protocol. 7 However, such an inclusion was deemed impractical based on the timeline developed for the guidelines which exceeded the average life-expectancy of such patients. In future updates, which the authors expect to be less time-intensive, aggressive attempts will be made to include a consumer representative.\nOur process identi /uniFB01 ed several areas in need of more rigorous investigation. Since IPC patients with MPEs typically have a limited lifespan,\nrequire frequent hospitalizations and palliative interventions, and may have an increased risk for complications such as infection, focusing on these aspects is paramount. Some speci /uniFB01 c targets for further clinical investigation could include the feasibility and ef /uniFB01 cacy of outpatient management of IPC-related pleural space infections; better methods of identifying factors predicting successful spontaneous pleurodesis; the value of combining IPC and pleurodesis approaches for minimizing time to and enhancing rate of catheter removal; or more precise methods of diagnosing IPC-related pleural infections. We also encourage reexamination of areas that have already been addressed, such as various outcomes related to aggressive IPC drainage schedules. These additional trials may help either solidify existing evidence or raise further questions by refuting it.\nIn conclusion, these guidelines were developed to provide practical and useful assistance to clinicians caring for patients with IPCs and MPEs. The authors hope that this document not only provides a valuable data summary and expert-based opinion for the reader but will stimulate future study and allow for more robust and evidence-based guidelines in the future.",
