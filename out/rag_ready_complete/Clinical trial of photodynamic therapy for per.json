      "title": "1. Introduction",
      "content": "Introduction Recently, the number of elderly patients with lung cancer has been increasing, and prompting the need for exploring minimally invasive treatment techniques. New pathological classi /uniFB01 cations for peripheral lung adenocarcinomas have been proposed, and new concepts, such as adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), have been introduced [1,2]. Lung cancers of this type are often visualized as GGOs on chest CT and have a relatively good prognosis. In the future, for the treatment of AIS and MIA, neither surgery nor RT may be required. Minimally invasive treatments, such as endoscopic treatments, are unmet medical needs for such cancers..\nFor de /uniFB01 nitive diagnosis of small nodules in the peripheral lung,\nbronchoscopy using radial endobronchial ultrasound (R-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)) and a combination of this modality with virtual bronchoscopic navigation (VBN) are very useful [3 -5]. Bronchoscopic diagnosis using these new techniques of R-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and VBN has improved the diagnostic yield for small peripheral pulmonary lesions measuring less than 3.0 cm in diameter [6,7]. Especially, peripheral pulmonary lesions are easy to access by electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB), such as that using the superDimension navigation system, and the accessibility and diagnostic rates of peripheral lung cancers have improved [8,9].\nPhotodynamic therapy (PDT) consists of using a tumor-speci /uniFB01 c photosensitizer and laser irradiation to induce the production of reactive oxygen species in cancer cells [10 -12]. Since the /uniFB01 rst modern clinical trial of PDT reported by Dougherty et al., the photosensitizer photofrin has been applied for the treatment of many kinds of cancers\nReceived 20 January 2020; Received in revised form 11 February 2020; Accepted 24 February 2020\nAvailable online 18 March 2020\n1572-1000/ © 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n[13 -16]. The second-generation photosensitizer, talapor /uniFB01 n sodium (Laserphyrin ® ) well known as mono-L-aspartyl chlorine e6 (NPe6), which has a major absorption band at 664 nm, was approved for the treatment of centrally located early lung cancers (CLELCs) by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in 2004 [17,18]. Kato and Furukawa et al. reported, based on a phase II clinical study, that PDT using talapo /uniFB01 n and a diode laser was safe, including being associated with a signi /uniFB01 cantly lower frequency of skin photosensitivity than photofrin-PDT, and showed excellent antitumor e /uniFB00 ect in patients with CLELs [17]. Usuda et al. reported that PDT using talapor /uniFB01 n exerted a strong antitumor e /uniFB00 ect against CLELCs measuring > 1.0 cm in diameter (19). According to their report, the CRs of centrally located lung cancers measuring ≤ 1.0 and > 1.0 cm in diameter were 94 % (66 of 70 cases) and 90.4 % (19 of 21 cases), respectively. We analyzed the relationship between the tumor size and clinical response and found no signi /uniFB01 cant correlation between the tumor size and clinical response [19]. Moreover, there was no signi /uniFB01 cant di /uniFB00 erence in the e /uniFB03 cacy of talapo /uniFB01 n-PDT between tumors ≤ 1.0 and > 1.0 cm in diameter.\nHowever, until now, PDT has only been approved for centrally located lung cancers, but not for peripheral lung cancers, even though the accessibility and diagnosis rate of peripheral lung cancers have improved with the use of R-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and/or VBN (5 -7). This could be explained as there was no laser probe that could be inserted into peripheral lung lesions.\nIn this study, we report the use of a new laser probe developed by us, the composite-type optical /uniFB01 berscope (COF), which allows accurate laser irradiation with simultaneous visualization of the cancer lesion. Oka et al. reported applying the COF technology to develop a new device for laser surgery to treat twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome [20,21]. In this study, we developed a new minimally invasive laser device using a COF with an external diameter of 1.0 mm, which can be introduced into peripheral lung lesions for laser irradiation. We conducted this phase I clinical study to investigate the feasibility and antitumor e /uniFB00 ect of PDT using talapor /uniFB01 n sodium and the new laser probe for peripheral-type lung cancers.",

If there were no adverse events of grade 3 or greater severity, the laser dose was to be increased to 100 J/cm 2 of the lesion on the maximum-section plane (Fig. 1). Thus, the dosing conditions for laser irradiation were the same as those used for PDT of centrally located early lung cancers [17 -19]. If the maximum tumor cross-sectional area was greater than 1.0 cm 2 , irradiations were undertaken from multiple directions to irradiate the entire tumor.",

We could simultaneously observe and irradiate the cancer lesions in the peripheral regions of the lung. To obtain a de /uniFB01 nitive histopathological/cytological diagnosis, we performed TBLB using a GS and/or R-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) for the peripheral lung tumors.\nThe mean age was 77.1 years (72 -90), and the average size of the nodules was 16.7 mm (13.6 -20). The histological type was adenocarcinoma in 6 patients and squamous cell carcinoma in 1 patient. The tumor lesion was in the upper lobe in 4 patients, and in the lower lobe in the remaining 3 patients.\nFor the /uniFB01 rst three patients, laser irradiation was performed at 50 J/ cm 2 according to the protocol. Ninety days after the PDT, the occurrence rate of adverse events of grade 2 or higher severity was 0%. One\nFig. 2. Composite optical /uniFB01 berscope.

(B) The COF was a straight-type laser probe, not a cylindrical-type.\npatient (Case 2) showed grade 1 skin photosensitivity. We con /uniFB01 rmed that talapor /uniFB01 n-PDT using the new laser probe was feasible after successful treatment of 3 patients at the laser dose 50 J/cm 2 . According to the protocol, we administered PDT at an escalated laser dose of 100 J/ cm 2 to the remaining 4 patients. Of the total of 7 patients in this clinical study, one case (Case 2) showed photosensitivity; no other treatmentrelated complications were encountered (Table 1). There were no major complications such as pneumothorax, hemothorax or pneumonia. Fig. 3 shows the clinical pro /uniFB01 le of Case 1. The patient was a 90-year-old man; the diagnosis was de /uniFB01 nitively established by TBLB as adenocarcinoma, c-T1bN0N0 stage IA in rt S 2 (Fig. 3A). The patient refused surgical resection and SBRT, and desired to undergo PDT using the new laser\nprobe. Talapor /uniFB01 n sodium at the dose of 40 mg/m 2 was administered by intravenous injection 4 h before the PDT. We introduced the guide sheath (GS) into the cancer lesion using superDimensionTM ENB, a bronchoscopic navigation system (Fig. 3B). Using this system, it is easy to determine the distance to the target lesion in real time and accurately introduce the GS. In addition, the ultrasound probe was introduced though the GS and the cancer lesion was located accurately (Fig. 3C). Subsequently, we removed the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) probe from within the GS. A saline bu /uniFB00 er was injected into the peripheral side of the bronchus, and the peripheral bronchus was dilated. We inserted the new laser probe, the COF, into the cancer lesion, visualized the tumor and irradiated the tumor with red laser (664 nm) (Fig. 3D). The endpoint of this study was\nn-PDT using the new laser probe.\nA\nB\nC\nD\nthe occurrence rate at 90 days after the PDT of adverse events of grade 2 or higher severity in the patients, and the rate was 0%.

As the secondary endpoint, the local-progression-free survival rate at 90 days and at 1 year after the PDT was 100 %. From these results, we concluded that PDT using the new laser probe for peripheral-type lung cancer is feasible and very e /uniFB00 ective.",

      "content": "Recently, use of chest CT imaging and implementation of lung cancer screening have expanded, and the detection rate of peripheral lung nodules is increasing [7 -9]. At present, for lung cancer lesions in the lung periphery measuring less than 30 mm in diameter, surgical resection remains the treatment modality of choice. However, the prognosis of small nodules visualized as GGOs may be good, and surgical resection may not be necessary. For these cancers, minimally invasive treatments, such as bronchoscopic treatment, may be desirable. Okunaka et al. reported that percutaneous-PDT for peripheral lung cancer was e /uniFB00 ective and promising [22]. However, the percutaneous approach for PDT may cause pneumothorax, and cerebral infarction by air embolism [7]. Therefore, recently, bronchoscopy-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been developed and applied for the treatment of peripheral lung cancers [7,23,24]. It has been reported that RFA and microwave treatment generate heat and bubbles around the tumor [7,23,24]. However, lasers used for PDT have low power and do not generate heat, and are safer than RFA. Even if RFA or microwave treatment can be performed, PDT may be more feasible and perhaps better.\nIn this study, 4 of the 7 enrolled patients showed CR, both at 3 months and at 1 year after the PDT, because histopathological examination of TBLB specimens showed no evidence of malignancy. However, no signi /uniFB01 cant reduction of the tumor size was observed on the chest CT images. In a study conducted by our colleagues, Okunaka et al., in which nine patients with peripheral lung cancers were enrolled for treatment of the cancer by PDT using catheters placed percutaneously under CT guidance [22], the tumor size did not change much. It is also di /uniFB03 cult to evaluate the antitumor e /uniFB00 ect of SBRT on the chest CT. Although PET-CT assessment may be an option to determine the e /uniFB03 -cacy of SBRT and PDT, it is not a su /uniFB03 cient assessment.\nThis is because in /uniFB02 ammatory e /uniFB00 ect was induced after PDT, and PETCT does not always re /uniFB02 ect the therapeutic e /uniFB00 ect. It is important to properly evaluate the antitumor e /uniFB00 ect of PDT, so that it can be established as a valid treatment modality for the future.\nTo improve the feasibility and e /uniFB03 cacy of PDT, guidance of the COF, the laser probe, is very important. To guide the probe precisely to the cancer lesion, cylindrical-type rather than straight-type /uniFB01 bers would be more e /uniFB00 ective. In the future, we think that it is necessary to develop these two types of laser probes, and consider how to use them properly for accurate placement at the cancer lesion. Moreover, establishment of the laser irradiation method and simulation of the irradiation dose as in radiation treatment planning are future problems to be addressed.\nThis multicenter clinical trial was the world ' s /uniFB01 rst trial of talapor /uniFB01 nPDT for c-stage IA peripheral lung cancer. PDT was found to be a feasible and non-invasive treatment modality for early peripheral lung cancers. In the future, talapor /uniFB01 n-PDT could become a useful treatment modality for non-invasive adenocarcinomas, such as AIS, MIA, and the standard option for stage IA peripheral lung cancers.",
