Pleural manometry is widely used to safeguard against pressure-related complications during thoracentesis despite little evidence to support the approach. We investigated whether monitoring of pleural pressure with manometry during thoracentesis could protect against complications compared with assessment of symptoms alone. Methods We did a prospective randomised single-blind trial involving patients with large pleural e/uniFB00usions at two academic medical centres in, Nashville, TN, and Baltimore, MD, USA. Eligible patients were adults with free-flowing e/uniFB00usions estimated to be at least 0·5 L who could remain seated throughout the procedure. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive thoracentesis guided by symptoms only (control) or by symptoms plus manometry at timepoints based on volume drained. The randomisation schedule was computer generated, used permuted blocks of four and six, and was stratified by participating institution. Patients, who were masked to study-group assignment, were asked to rate chest discomfort on 100 mm visual analogue scales before, during, and after drainage. In both groups drainage was discontinued before complete evacuation of pleural fluid if patients developed persistent chest discomfort, intractable cough, or other complications. In the manometry group, an additional criterion for stopping was if endexpiratory pleural pressure was lower than -20 cm H 2 O or declined by more than 10 cm H 2 O between two measurements to a value less than or equal to -10 cm H 2 O. The primary outcome was overall chest discomfort from before the start to after the procedure measured by patients 5 min after the end of drainage. Analysis was by modified intention to treat (ie, included all patients with any procedure or outcome data). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02677883. Findings Between March 4, 2016, and Sept 8, 2017, 191 patients were screened, of whom 128 were randomly assigned treatment and 124 were included in the final analysis (62 in each group). Four patients were excluded because of manometer malfunction (n=2), inability to access e/uniFB00usion due to pleural tumour burden (n=1), and inability to remain seated (n=1).

      "content": "More  than  1·5  million  pleural  e/uniFB00usions  are  diagnosed annually in the USA, making thoracentesis for diagnostic sampling  and  therapeutic  aspiration  one  of  the  most commonly  performed  medical  procedures. 1-3 Although generally perceived as being a safe procedure, in a series of  more  than  9300  thoracenteses  performed  by  expert operators, the complication rate exceeded 3% when large volumes  (>1·5  L)  were  aspirated,  including  incidence of  2·2% for pneumothorax and 0·75% for re-expansion\npulmonary oedema. 4 Complications of therapeutic thoracentesis,  including  pneumothorax  ex  vacuo,  chest discomfort,  and  re-expansion  pulmonary  oedema,  have been associated with increasingly negative pleural pressure  resulting  from  aspiration  of  pleural  fluid  in patients  with  non-expandable  lung. 5-10 Pleural  pressures lower  than  -20  cm  H 2 O  are  deemed  to  be  excessively negative. 3,7,11 This  threshold  was  based  on  early  animal models in which the lowest risk of complications was seen at  pressures  greater  than  -20  mm  Hg  (-27  cm  H 2 O). 8,9\nPleural manometry monitoring to mitigate these pressurerelated procedural risks during thoracentesis has become widely used. 1,3,5-7,10,12-17\nMany pleural disease experts and a web-based resource aimed at supporting clinical decision making that is widely used  in  the  USA  advocate  limiting  aspiration  of  pleural fluid  during  large-volume  thoracentesis  based  on  pleural manometry criteria. Termination of the procedure is recommended if pleural pressure drops to less than -20 cm H 2 O or  pleural  elastance  exceeds  14·5  cm  H 2 O/L. 1,6,12,15,18 By contrast the British Thoracic Society recommends limiting drainage to 1·5 L fluid to avoid excessively negative pleural pressure. 11 Several reports have indicated that aspiration of larger volumes is safe if manometry is used, 5-7 but no society guidelines yet make  this recommendation,  citing insu/uniFB03cient  comparative  evidence. 19 We  did  a  randomised clinical  trial  to  investigate  whether  monitoring  of  pleural pressure with manometry  during  thoracentesis could protect against complications compared with assessment of symptoms during fluid aspiration.",

E/uniFB00usion volume was estimated to be at least 0·5 L if one or more of the following criteria were met: e/uniFB00usion filling at least a third of the hemithorax on chest x-ray, 20 maximum  anteroposterior  depth  of  e/uniFB00usion  at least a third of the anteroposterior dimension on the axial CT  image  superior  to  the  hemidiaphragm  (including atelectatic lung completely surrounded by e/uniFB00usion), 21 or e/uniFB00usion spanning at least three interspaces on ultrasonography,  with  a  depth  of  3  cm  or  greater  in  at least one interspace while the patient was sitting upright.\nExclusion criteria included non-free-flowing e/uniFB00usions, inability to maintain a seated position for the procedure, manometry  judged  to  be  clinically  indicated  by  the person  doing  the  procedure,  and  inability  to  provide informed consent. We also excluded patients with known re-expandable lung based  on  recurrent transudative pleural e/uniFB00usions (according to Light's criteria 23 ) of known cause,  multiple  previous  thoracenteses  without  substantial chest discomfort, and no clinical suspicion that the current e/uniFB00usion was due to anything other than the known  underlying  cause;  any  disease  or  disorder  that would  interfere  with  the  safe  completion  of  the  study (eg,  coagulopathy  or  hemodynamic  instability)  at  the discretion of the person doing the procedure; and pleural e/uniFB00usion  smaller  than  expected  based  on  bedside  ultrasonography or with multiple loculations on ultrasound scans before the procedure.",

      "content": "Therapeutic thoracentesis is among the most commonly performed procedures in clinical medicine. Aspiration of pleural fluid in patients with non-expandable lung increases negative pressure in the pleural space, associated with procedural complications, including pneumothorax, re-expansion pulmonary oedema, and chest discomfort, in observational human studies, animal models, or both. Monitoring of pleural pressure during therapeutic thoracentesis has, therefore, garnered interest as a potential safeguard against these pressure-related events. We searched PubMed for articles published before July 1, 2018, reporting studies of pleural manometry during thoracentesis, using the search term '((((thoracentesis[Title]) OR pleural[Title]) AND manometry[Title]) OR manometer[Title]) OR pressure[Title])'. We found no randomised trials on this topic, but in multiple prospective observational or retrospective series, manometry has precisely defined pleural elastance curves (with potential implications for choice of future palliative pleural interventions) and identified excessively negative pleural pressure in the small number of patients who remain asymptomatic despite potentially harmful pleural pressure. Several studies have suggested that the 1·5 L aspiration limit recommended by the British Thoracic Society can be safely\nexceeded if manometry is used to monitor pleural pressure during thoracentesis. However, the largest clinical series showed no benefit. Society guidelines have not recommended for or against routine monitoring with pleural manometry, citing insufficient evidence, but it continues to be widely used and advocated.",

      "content": "All patients underwent  thoracic ultrasonography to identify  the  optimum  catheter  place  ment  area,  where local infiltration of plain 1% lidocaine was administered before  a  5,  6,  or  8  F  over-needle-style  catheter  (Safe-TCentesis, BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA or Arrow-Clarke, Teleflex, Morrisville, NC, USA) was placed. The procedure was done with the standard sterile technique. Complete evacuation of pleural fluid via manual aspiration  with  a  60  mL  syringe  was  attempted  in  all patients.  Drainage  was  paused  for  5-10  s  per  200  mL fluid  drained  for  the  first  1  L,  then  per  every  100  mL thereafter.  During  each  pause,  patients  was  asked  to indicate  his  or  her  degree  of  chest  discomfort  on  a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS). 23,24\nIn the manometry group, end-expiratory pleural pressure  was  measured  during  normal  tidal  breathing with a validated single-use digital manometer (Compass, Centurion  Medical  Products,  Williamston,  MI,  USA) positioned  in  line  between  the  catheter  and  drainage tubing. 13 Pleural  pressure  was  measured  immediately after intrapleural placement  of the catheter, during drainage  pauses,  and  just  before  catheter  removal.  For each measurement, to account for variation, we observed several tidal respiratory cycles and manually recorded the most frequent end-expiratory pressure.\nIn  both  treatment  groups,  drainage  was  terminated before complete e/uniFB00usion evacuation if patients experienced persistent  chest  discomfort  consistent  with  excessively negative pleural pressure (felt in anterior chest, neck, or both and unimproved after catheter retraction to exclude\ndiaphragm  irritation),  intractable  cough,  or  procedural complications.  Additionally,  in  the  manometry  group drainage was stopped if pleural pressure dropped to less than -20 cm H 2 O or declined by more than 10 cm H 2 O between two measurements to a value of -10 cm H 2 O or lower. The pressure limit of -20 cm H 2 O was chosen based on the historical definition of excessively negative pleural pressure  and  current  practice guidelines. 7,11 The  stop criterion for rapidly falling pleural pressure was adapted from  the  classic  pleural  elastance  curves  of  Light  and colleagues 3 and  was  included  as  an  indicator  trapped  or entrapped lung and impending excessively negative pleural pressure.\nChest discomfort was measured on a 100 mm horizontal VAS with the labels 'No discomfort at all' at 0 and 'Worst possible discomfort' at 100 mm. This scoring technique is well-validated for patient-reported pain measurements 23,24 Two  investigators  assessed  scores  independently,  and scoring  disagreements  could  be  arbitrated  by  a  third investigator  (RJL,  LR,  ADL,  and  LY).  VAS  scoring  was done before the procedure, just after catheter placement, during all drainage pauses, and after drainage was stopped but before catheter removal. We also collected VAS scores for  overall  chest  discomfort  from  the  start  of  procedure to  5  min  and  15  min  after  the  procedure  and  for breathlessness before and 15 min after completion of the procedure. 25,26\nProcedures  were  timed  from  catheter  insertion  to removal. Bedside ultrasonography was done immediately after  the  procedure  to  assess  the  degree  of  residual e/uniFB00usion. Chest x-rays were done within 1 h of procedure completion  to  check  for  pleural  apposition,  and  were assessed for pneumothorax and re-expansion pulmonary oedema by a chest  radiologist  unaware  of  study  group allocation.",

Statistical analysis  proceeded  according  to  a  prespecified  analysis plan. Analyses were done by modified intention to treat (ie, including all patients with any procedure or outcome data). Descriptive statistics included means and SDs for continuous  variables,  percentages  and  frequencies  for categorical variables, and an investigation for outliers. We assumed  normality  and  homoscedasticity  for  statistical analyses.  For  comparisons  between  groups  we  used  the t test  for  continuous  variables  and  χ²  test  for  categorical variables. Linear regression was employed  to assess di/uniFB00erences in chest discomfort and breathlessness scores between groups, which are reported as mean di/uniFB00erences and 95% CIs. To account for the dependence of repeated measurements, we applied a linear model with generalised least squares (a mixed model with random intercept) with the AR1 correlation structure in R to assess the trends of dis  comfort scores during the procedure.\nWe  did two prespecified subanalyses: a  subgroup analysis of the primary outcome in e/uniFB00usions determined to  be  exudative  by  Light's  criteria, 28 and  trends  in  VAS chest discomfort scores in patients with less than or equal to  1·5  L  fluid  drained.  The  hypothesis  for  the  first subanalysis was that exudates would be more likely than transudates to alter pleural elastance and, therefore, make it impossible  to develop  excessively negative pleural pressure,  meaning  that  patients  with  exudates  might benefit  more  from  manometry.  The  second  subanalysis was done because the British Thoracic Society guidelines 11 suggest that no more than 1·5 L fluid should be aspirated at  one time to keep the risk of negative-pressure-related complications to a minimum, but a study has shown that greater volumes can be aspirated safely when manometry is  used. 3,5 Assuming  that  both  are  true,  a  significant reduction  in  chest  discomfort  in  the  manometry  group could  conceivably  be  driven  by  patients  in  whom  very large  volumes  were  aspirated,  and  this  analysis  would address this potentially confounding e/uniFB00ect.\nA data monitoring committee did not oversee this study because both approaches to therapeutic thoracentesis are standard  and  represent  minimum  study-related  risk  to patients.  This  trial  is  registered  with  clinicaltrials.gov, number NCT02677883.",

Average chest discomfort and breathlessness on the  day  of  thoracentesis  before  the  procedure  were similar in the two groups (table 2).\nThe  primary  outcome  of  overall  procedural  chest discomfort  rated  at  5  min  after  the  procedure  did  not significantly di/uniFB00er between the control and manometry groups (mean di/uniFB00erence in VAS scores 2·4 mm, 95% CI -5·7  to  10·5,  p=0·56;  figure  2).  After  adjustment  for institution,  the  results  remained  similar  (2·5  mm, 95%  CI  -5·4  to  10·5,  p=0·53).  Overall  procedural discomfort in patients with e/uniFB00usions determined to be\nexudative did not di/uniFB00er between groups (mean di/uniFB00erence in VAS scores -5·1 mm, 95% CI -14·2 to 3·9, p=0·26).\nWe  found  no  significant di/uniFB00erences between  the control and manometry groups for any of the secondary outcome measures (table 2, figures 2, 3).  The  trend  in VAS chest discomfort scores excluding volumes removed in  excess  of  1·5  L  also  did  not  di/uniFB00er  between  groups (p interaction =0·10).  A  post-hoc  comparison  of  the  primary outcome  among  patients  with  previous  painful  thoracentesis  revealed  no  di/uniFB00erence  between  groups  (mean VAS  score 27·3 [23·1] mm  in  the control group vs 24·6 [21·1] mm in the manometry group, p=0·73).\nE/uniFB00usion  drainage  was  halted  after  meeting  a  pleural pressure stop criterion in 13 (21%) of 62 patients in the manometry group (table 3). Drainage was discontinued for  chest  discomfort  in  similar  numbers  of  patients  in the two groups, and procedure duration, volume drained, and  rate  of  complete  lung  re-expansion  did  not  di/uniFB00er significantly (table 3, figure 4). The cause of e/uniFB00usion was established in 107 (86%) patients (table 4).\nSix  (10%)  of  62  patients  in  the  control  group  had pneumothorax ex vacuo evident on chest x-ray after the\nprocedure. No patients in the manometry group developed pneumothorax, representing a significant di/uniFB00erence  between  groups  (p=0·01).  No  patient  with pneumothorax  had  symptoms  or  needed  intervention. No other complications occurred in either group. 16  (22%)  of  72  ambulatory  patients  did  not  attend  for chest  radiography  after  the  procedure  (seven  in  the control group and nine in the manometry group).",

      "content": "In  this  multicentre  single-blind  randomised  controlled trial, we assessed patient-centred clinical outcomes during therapeutic thoracentesis for large pleural e/uniFB00usions. Our data  suggest  that  routine  use  of  manometry  during thoracentesis will not reduce procedural chest discomfort or a/uniFB00ect breathlessness and, therefore, does not improve patients' comfort. Additionally, we  noted  no  serious complications in the control group. These data, alongside those from previous prospective studies suggest  ing that manometry  does  not  prevent  re-expansion  pulmonary oedema  or  pneumothorax,  lead  to  questions  about  the usefulness of pleural manometry.\nPrevious  studies  have  identified  associations  between excessively  negative  pleural  pressure  and  re-expansion pulmonary oedema, pneumothorax ex vacuo, and chest discomfort. 3,5-9 However, not all patients with excessively negative pleural pressure during therapeutic thoracentesis have chest discomfort. 6 This finding, along with the rarity of serious complications  if aspiration of very large e/uniFB00usion  volumes  in  a  single  procedure  are  avoided,\nData are mean (SD) or n (%). *Other causes were fibrosing mediastinitis (n=1), post-transplant fibrinothorax with entrapment physiology (n=1), and non-specific pleuritis (n=1).\nTable 1: Baseline characteristics\nsupport the recommendation that no more than 1·5 L be drained in one procedure. 6,11,29 Advocates of manometric pleural  monitoring  during  large  volume  thoracentesis note that asymptomatic excessively negative pleural pressure  can  be  detected,  which  they  suggest  allows aspirations  exceeding  recommendations  to  be  safely achieved. 5-7,12  Uptake of manometry has been widespread;\nmany studies of pleural manometry have been reported in  the  past  decade,  manometry  education  sessions  are provided  at  most  international  pulmonary  conferences and pleural courses, and several ongoing clinical trials are addressing the ability of manometry to predict clinically meaningful endpoints (NCT03319186,  NCT02805062, and NCT02192138).\nMonitoring  with manometry  during  thoracentesis, however,  has  not  been  shown  to  protect  against  reexpansion pulmonary oedema, pneumothorax ex vacuo, or chest discomfort. 5,10,14,27 Re-expansion pulmonary oedema is a rare complication that was independent of pleural pressure, pleural elastance, and volume of aspirated  e/uniFB00usion  in  a  large  prospective  series. 5 Two earlier  series,  one  retrospective 14 and  one  prospective, 27 found pneumothorax after eight (4%) of 192 and nine  (16%)  of  57  procedures,  despite  pleural  pressure stop criteria of -25 cm H 2 O and -20 cm H 2 O measured by manometry. In most patients, pneumothorax occurred when non-expandable lung was not suspected before the procedure.  A  large  retrospective  series  also  showed  no decrease  in  chest  discomfort  after  thoracentesis  when pleural  manometry  was  used  compared  with  patients who underwent procedures without manometry. 10\nOur trial provides robust evidence that supports previous  findings  of  no  protection  against  important pressure-related complications with the use of manometry during therapeutic pleural aspiration. The lack of protection  against  chest  discomfort  with  manometry could  have  several  explanations.  First,  chest  discomfort seems  to  be  inconsistently  associated  with  excessively\n(A) Overall chest discomfort from the start to 5 min after completion of thoracentesis. (B) Overall chest discomfort from the start to 15 min after completion of thoracentesis. (C) Breathlessness from before to 15 min after completion of thoracentesis.\nnegative pleural pressure. Feller-Kopman and colleagues 6 found  in  a  large  prospective  series  of  169  patients  that only  four  (22%)  of  18  patients  who  developed  chest discomfort indicative of excessively negative pleural pressure  and  12  (9%)  140  who  had  no  symptoms  had pressures  greater  than  -20  cm  H 2 O.  This  observation suggests that pleural pressure thresholds for chest discomfort  vary  between  individuals.  Heidecker  and colleagues, 14 found that manometry did not mitigate the risk  of  pneumothorax  ex  vacuo  and  hypothesised  that stress  exerted  on  visceral  pleura  could  be  non-uniform due  to  regional  variability  in  pleural  elastance,  which might also explain the poor correlation between pain and excessively negative pressure. Second, measurements of pleural  pressure  are  obtained  during  brief  drainage interruptions, which means that for substantial periods pressure is not measured, during which acute changes on pleural pressure might go unnoticed. Third, the use of a manometer  in  this  study  might  have  emboldened  the operators  to continue  drainage  despite  the  patient's symptoms if pleural pressure was otherwise reassuring; we  were  unable  to  mask  operators  to  the  study  group. Scores for overall procedural discomfort were higher in the  manometry  group,  although  not  significantly  so, and  in  patients  from  whom  more  than  1·5  L  e/uniFB00usion was  drained,  there  was  a  trend  towards  more  rapidly increasing  chest  discomfort  VAS  scores  than  in  the control group. Only a small number of patients, however, had very large volumes of e/uniFB00usion aspirated, which limits the ability to draw any firm conclusions.\nOf  principal  importance  in  interpreting  the  negative results of this trial is whether they represent a true nondi/uniFB00erence  between  symptom-guided  and  manometryguided  thoracentesis (type II error).  This  study  was powered  to  detect  a  clinically  meaningful  di/uniFB00erence  in discomfort  based  on  previous  investigations  (superiority design), met recruitment targets, had no baseline di/uniFB00erences  between  groups,  had  very  few  dropouts  after randomisation (and all were due to technical issues), and had  complete  outcome  data  on  100%  of  patients  who underwent thoracentesis. Variability of the primary outcome did not exceed the assumed variability used in the power  calculation  (overall  SD  22·6  compared  with  the assumed SD of 30). Multiple analyses of chest discomfort data  beyond  the  primary  outcome,  including  change  in discomfort  from  before  to  after  thoracentesis,  trend  in discomfort  during  the  procedure,  and  outcomes  among patients most  at risk of excessively negative pleural pressure,  also  showed  no  di/uniFB00erences  between  groups. Finally,  among  191  screened  patients,  41  (21%)  were excluded  before  randomisation  (22  who  did  not  meet inclusion criteria and 19 who met exclusion criteria), which is quite low and enhances the external applicability of our findings. We acknowledge that two secondary outcomeschange in VAS chest discomfort score from before to the end of drainage and change in breathlessness from before to  15  min  after  completion  of  the  procedure-involve\nbaseline  scores  obtained  after  random  assignment  that, theoretically, are at risk of bias resulting from allocation. It seems unlikely, however, that our results were a/uniFB00ected by this  bias  because  patients  were  masked  to  study  group. The primary outcome, the other secondary outcomes, and the prespecified subanalyses were una/uniFB00ected.\nThe frequency of pneumothorax ex vacuo was significantly  greater  in  the  control  group  than  in  the manometry group. Pneumothorax ex vacuo is a consequence of excessively negative pressure resulting in pressure equilibration by air entry into the pleural space, either from a small visceral pleural tear or irruption of air\nData are n (%) or mean (SD). NA=not applicable. NC=not calculable. *Drop of >10 cm H2O between two measurements to a value ≤-10 cm H2O.\nTable 3: Procedure data\nvia the catheter tract. Pneumothorax ex vacuo is typically asymptomatic (in fact, intentionally allowing air entrainment via the catheter often improves chest discomfort  due  to  excessively  negative  pleural  pressure) and is not thought to represent a complication of thoracentesis, but rather a demonstration of the underlying  abnormal  pleural  physiology  for  which  no therapeutic intervention is needed or indicated. Furthermore, because more than 10% of patients in this study (11% in the control group and 15% in the manometry group) did not attend chest radiography after thoracentesis, the validity of our finding cannot be guaranteed. Therefore,  although  manometry  might  have  prevented some  cases  of  pneumothorax  ex  vacuo  in  our  patients, diagnosing  abnormal  pleural  elastance  by  manometry rather than postprocedure chest radiography seems clinically advantageous only in individuals who intend to travel by air shortly after their procedure.\nAlthough  we  found  no  benefit  with  routine  use  of pleural manometry, we note that it is clearly useful in specific clinical circumstances. Pleural manometry elucidates pleural elastance curves, facilitating the diagnosis  of  trapped  or  entrapped  lung,  and  might predict  the  success  of  chemical  pleurodesis  and  the likelihood of spontaneous pleurodesis with an indwelling  pleural  catheter  and,  therefore,  inform  the choice of treatments for the palliative management of a recurrent symptomatic  e/uniFB00usion. 30,31 In a patient in whom trapped or entrapped lung is strongly suspected before  thoracentesis  or  in  whom  pleurodesis  is  being considered,  pleural  manometry  might  provide  crucial\ninsight  into  the  underlying  pleural  physiology  with clinical implications.\nThis  study  has  several  limitations.  First,  it  was  not powered to  detect  di/uniFB00erences  between  groups  in  the frequency  of  pneumothorax  ex  vacuo  or  re-expansion pulmonary  oedema,  of  which  the  latter  is  the  most clinically serious pressure-related complication of thoracentesis. Re-expansion pulmonary oedema is, however, rare, and instead we chose to power the study to assess di/uniFB00erences in chest discomfort, which occurs frequently and is  an  important  patient-centred  outcome.  Second, pleural  pressure  could  only  be  accurately  measured when fluid aspiration was paused. Continuous pleural manometry during fluid aspiration might allow operators  to  see  abrupt  changes  in  pleural  elastance sooner. However, devices that enable continuous pleural mano  metry  are  not  available  for  routine  clinical  use and, therefore, we used the standard approach of using a  validated  single-use  digital  manometer.  Future  comparative studies using continuous manometry might be useful. Third, this was not a study of very-large-volume thoracentesis  (>1·5  L),  for  which  manometry  might o/uniFB00er more benefit. Nevertheless, among the few patients  who  had  more  than  1·5  L  e/uniFB00usion  drained, there was a trend towards more chest discomfort in the manometry  group  than  in  the  control,  which  argues against  a  benefit  of  manometry  in  this  subgroup. Finally, the use of baseline VAS scores after allocation could have led to bias, but we believe that masking of study group allocation prevented any e/uniFB00ect on the two implicated secondary outcomes.\nData  taken  to  support  the  use  of  routine  monitoring with pleural manometry during therapeutic thoracentesis indicate  that  some  patients  who  develop  excessively negative  pleural  pressure  are  asymptomatic  and  that volumes of fluid greater 1·5 L might be safely aspirated if pleural  pressure  is  monitored. 3,6,7 Despite  widespread routine  use,  no  high-quality  comparative  studies  have shown benefits with the use of manometry, and prospective and  retrospective series  have  concluded that  pleural  manometry  does  not  prevent  re-expansion pulmonary  oedema,  pneumothorax,  or  chest  dis  comfort. 5,10,14,25 Our randomised multicentre trial  showed  no reduction in pain or improvements in post  inter  vention breathlessness, safety, volume  drained,  or  speed  of procedure.  Our  data,  therefore,  do  not  support  the routine use of pleural manometry during large-volume therapeutic thoracentesis.",
