Mota, MD, MPH,* Jorge Dionísio, MD,* José Duro da Costa, MD,* and Sandra Faias, MD †‡\nSummary: This study was conducted with the aim of evaluating a 10-year experience in the Pulmonology Department of a cancer center for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy through transnasal route (TN-PEG) in patients with head and neck cancer whose oral access is precluded. This study was a retrospective analysis of 40 consecutive head and neck cancer patients referred for PEG placement, between 2005 and 2014, using a transnasal route because of the impossibility of intubation through the oral cavity. Demographics, outcome of TNPEG procedure, indications for bronchoscopic approach (prophylactic/palliative), clinical need for bronchoscopy (trismus, oropharyngeal obstruction), location of cancer, complications, and overall survival were reviewed. In 40 TN-PEG procedures, executed by 1 of 3 pulmonologists, 39 were successfully placed and there were no immediate complications. All except 1 complication were minor, but no surgery or PEG removal was required. There was a rapid learning curve among all operators. A combined TN-PEG placement by a gastroenterologist and a pulmonologist is a safe and useful option for these patients; the learning curve for successfully performing the procedure was short.\nKey Words: transnasal PEG, adapted bronchoscope, oropharyngeal obstruction, trismus\n( J Bronchol Intervent Pulmonol 2018;25:73 -77)\nP atients with upper aerodigestive tumors are particularly prone to malnutrition due to dysphagia secondary to tumor mass effect\n(obstruction, trismus) and/or to treatment (chemotherapy, adiotherapy) side effects. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is ultimately required in most of these patients for nutritional support. In some situations the tumor precludes the transoral approach with a conventional endoscope, demanding a thin endoscope for PEG tube placement, not always available in many institutions. The use of a /uniFB02 exible bronchoscope has previously been described for this purpose. 1",

After local abdominal wall anesthesia, a catheter is passed into the stomach (Fig. 2C) and, through this, a guidewire is also passed into the stomach, where it is caught by the pediatric bronchoscope loop (Figs. 2D, 3A, B).

This is not an absolute contraindication for PEG placement, 2 but we decided not to proceed because of safety concerns. TN-PEG placement was performed with palliative intention in 27/39 and with prophylactic intention in 12/39. The transnasal route was chosen because of trismus in 25/39 and oropharyngeal obstruction in 14/39 in patients with cancer of nasal cavity/paranasal sinus (2/39), oral cavity (17/39), oropharynx (14/39), larynx (3/39), hypopharynx (1/39), and facial cutaneous melanoma with extensive involvement of mastication muscles (1/39) and metastatic involvement of the skull base with",

Complications occurred in 9/39 patients: early (less than a week after the procedure) in 4/9 (local infection treated pharmacologically) and late in 5/9 (3 cases of local infections, 1 case of extrusion, 1 Buried Bumper syndrome). Our 10% rate of early infections (presumably because of infectious agents transported along the PEG tube, even with the use of prophylactic antibiotics) is in the range cited in the literature. 3 Buried Bumper syndrome is a complication that occurs when the internal bumper of a PEG tube erodes and migrates through the gastric wall, becoming lodged between the gastric wall and the skin. This complication is solved by replacing the PEG tube through the same route using a guidewire or, if the gastric ori /uniFB01 ce becomes totally closed, repeating the endoscopic procedure. No complications required surgery or PEG removal. On follow-up, 10/39 patients were alive and 7 were in remission.

A ' esophagogastroscopy ' with the bronchoscope via the nasal route is performed by the pulmonologist, whereas the gastroenterologist ensures a correct intragastric canullation in order to seek the transillumination (mandatory step to ensure a safe and correct PEG placement) and capture the guidewire used to pull the PEG device through the nasogastric pathway. The learning curve is fast, however, demanding some mandatory steps including the following: knowledge about how to enter and pass the esophagus, how to distend it, how to maneuver inside the stomach and maintain it distended, how to /uniFB01 nd the anterior gastric wall for adequate transillumination, and how to catch and hold the guidewire.\nThe only unsuccessful PEG placement was due to transillumination failure in a patient with a particular gastric anatomy. None of the 9/39 supervened complications were related to the PEG procedure itself, and the majority occurred more than a week after the procedure. In our Department, all 3 pulmonologists were able to perform the procedure without dif /uniFB01 culties after their experience with 1 or 2 patients. The use of a 600 mm length bronchoscope (instead of an 1100 mm conventional gastroscope), suitable for an average size population, was not related to a higher rate of unsuccessful placements (only 2.5% failures in our series over a 10 y period).\nIn contrast, the role of an experienced gastroenterologist in PEG placement in this collaboration is fundamental, because moving through esophagogastric anatomy is not part of the pulmonologist ' s skills.",
