Flexible bronchoscopy can be performed with or without sedation, the choice of which is generally left to the practice pattern of the performing bronchoscopist. The concept of sedation is complex, with varying degrees of consciousness. These range from anxiolysis (minimal sedation), to conscious sedation (moderate sedation), to deep sedation, to\ngeneral anesthesia. Most institutions throughout the United States use moderate sedation, defined as a drug-induced decreased level of consciousness in which the patient is able to respond to verbal commands, with adequate spontaneous ventilation and normal cardiovascular function. 1 Some rigid and navigational bronchoscopic procedures are performed under general anesthesia with hopes of producing a higher diagnostic yield with greater patient tolerance, but evolving evidence suggests that moderate sedation may be comparable. 2,3 A consensus statement from the American College of Chest Physicians suggests that 'optimal procedural conditions are achieved when patients are comfortable, physicians are able to perform the procedure, and risk is minimized.' 4 This article is a comprehensive review of existing data regarding sedation during bronchoscopy.\nDisclosure Statement: No conflicts of interest exist for the aforementioned authors.\na Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street Southwest, Rochester, MN 55905, USA; b Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street Southwest, Rochester, MN 55905, USA\n* Corresponding author.\nE-mail address:\nMcCambridge.Amanda@mayo.edu",

      "title": "NO SEDATION",
      "content": "Initially bronchoscopy was more commonly performed with little or no sedation, owing to concern of associated adverse effects. Studies comparing bronchoscopy with and without sedation found no difference in rates of complication, and, as such, bronchoscopy without sedation was thought to be safe. These studies, however, did not assess patient tolerance, comfort, or willingness to undergo a repeat procedure. 5 The procedure itself is uncomfortable, with patients often experiencing difficulty breathing, cough, pain, fear, anxiety, and airway irritation. The use of sedation during bronchoscopy has improved outcomes, such as patient tolerance, reduction in cough, and patient likelihood to undergo a repeat future procedure, without increased complications. 6,7",

      "title": "TOPICAL ANESTHESIA",
      "content": "As time and medicine have advanced, so too have the options regarding sedation. Topical anesthesia is commonly used either alone or as an adjunct to systemic medications to optimize the procedure. Topical anesthesia is available in solution, gel, or spray and can be administered in a variety of ways, including syringe, soaked cotton pads, spray, nebulizer, nerve block, or transcricoid or transtracheal injection.\nBenzocaine and tetracaine spray were longstanding popular choices for anesthesia of the nasopharynx and posterior oropharynx. These are usually administered before initiation of bronchoscopy in an attempt to decrease the gag reflex and increase patient tolerance. However, the use of these methods is decreasing because of a narrow therapeutic window and concern for toxicity. If topical dosing of benzocaine exceeds 3 sprays, these medications can be associated with methemoglobinemia, in which the presence of elevated levels of oxyhemoglobin prevent oxygen binding and transport to the tissues, leading to cyanosis and potentially fatal complications ( Table 1 ). 8-10 These complications are especially more likely in patients with preexisting anemia. 10\nLidocaine is widely used as a topical anesthetic and can be administered in direct drip solution, nebulized spray, or gel forms. By decreasing ion transport across neuronal membranes, it blocks nerve impulse conduction, affording properties of anesthesia and cough suppression. A randomized controlled trial by Antoniades and Worsnop, 11 compared direct administration of lidocaine through a bronchoscope with placebo and found a significant reduction in both cough and total required sedation. Lidocaine is generally well\naccepted because of its wide therapeutic safety margin, short half-life, and minimal risk for toxicity. 11 Cardiac and neurologic toxicity are dose related and are often seen when the serum level exceeds 5 mg/L or topical dose is greater than 7 mg/kg. 12 We recommend close monitoring of the amount of lidocaine used, especially for prolonged cases and procedures performed in pediatric patients. Studies have found no significant difference in the anesthetic properties or reduction in cough in 1% versus 2% concentration of lidocaine, suggesting that the lower concentration is less likely to lead to potential toxicity. 13 Greater care must be used in special populations, such as those with congestive heart failure and liver dysfunction, out of concern for further cardiac toxicity or poor metabolism, respectively.\nNebulized lidocaine is another option for analgesia delivery, although supporting evidence in this area remains less convincing. One study found nodifference in cough frequency or patient discomfort when comparing nebulized lidocaine to the placebo, nebulized saline. 14 Notably, the onset of action of nebulized lidocaine is approximately 15 to 20 minutes, whereas direct drip lidocaine typically works within seconds of administration.\nAlthough useful for its vasoconstrictive properties leading to shrinkage of nasal mucosa (best for transnasal approach), cocaine has fallen out of favor because of the increased risk of myocardial infarction secondary to coronary vasoconstriction and intracoronary thrombus formation, as well as its habit-forming properties and abuse potential. 15,16\nTranscricoid or transtracheal direct injection of topical anesthetics, such as lidocaine or lignocaine is another alternative option to achieve effective topical anesthesia. The upper trachea is anesthetized by injection via the cricothyroid membrane or between the tracheal rings. This approach is thought to be associated with a reduction in cough and improved patient tolerance when compared with nebulized or directly administered lidocaine through the working channel of the bronchoscope, without an increase in complications. 17 An Irish single-blinded study found that use of transcricoid lignocaine significantly improved patient perceived ease of procedure and frequency of cough. 18 This approach has more potential complications when compared with other routes of topical anesthesia administrations, such as swelling, paratracheal abscess formation, hematoma or bleeding from puncture of the inferior thyroid artery, or subcutaneous emphysema formation. Graham and colleagues 17 only found minimal intratracheal mucosal bleeding and no significant difference in complication rates.\nLocal nerve block is also used to decrease gag reflex and cough frequency. Superior laryngeal block is achieved by identifying the hyoid bone and injecting local anesthetic on either side of the hyoid bone around the nerve root, leading to a loss of sensation in larynx, proximal trachea, and posterior epiglottis. To achieve a glossopharyngeal nerve block, one approach is to inject local anesthetic just lateral to the base of the anterior tonsillar pillar. This method affords a loss of sensation in the posterior wall of the oropharynx and the posterior third of the tongue. Clearly, specialized anatomic knowledge is necessary to use this method. When evaluated by DeMeester, and colleagues, 19 this approach afforded appropriate anesthesia and patient tolerance without out significant morbidity. A separate study again found safety and tolerability of a range of advanced diagnostic bronchoscopic procedures using nerve root block in combination with topical lidocaine and intravenous conscious sedation in 136 patients. 20",

      "title": "BENZODIAZEPINES",
      "content": "Benzodiazepines act via the potentiation of a central inhibitory neurotransmitter. This class of medications has been favored in bronchoscopic procedures because of their anxiolytic, hypnotic, muscle relaxant, and anterograde amnestic properties and the availability of a reversal agent. 21,22 Many options are available, including midazolam, diazepam, temazepam, and lorazepam, but midazolam is most widely favored for its rapid onset and peak effect and short half-life. 21,23,24\nIn placebo versus benzodiazepine administration, patients report increased procedural tolerance and increased likelihood of undergoing a repeat procedure. 6,25-27 Whencompared with opioids, benzodiazepines offer better amnesia and lower risk of respiratory depression although are notably less efficacious at cough reduction or time to baseline mental status. 6,28\nAdverse effects commonly associated with the use of these medications are drowsiness, ataxia, confusion, and falls. When used in bronchoscopy, compared with other forms of sedation, benzodiazepines are not found to have a higher incidence of complications but are associated with longer recovery times. 6 Propylene glycol toxicity is not typically a complication of lorazepam or diazepam continuous infusions as sedation for bronchoscopy. Greater care should be given to the critically ill with renal failure, as they are more likely to accumulate propylene glycol, but this is most commonly noted in infusions exceeding 1 mg/kg/d for more than 48 hours. 29,30",

      "title": "OPIOIDS",
      "content": "Opioids are also commonly used during bronchoscopy, mainly for their analgesic and antitussive abilities. There is a paucity of research regarding opioids alone in bronchoscopic sedation, but several studies found a complimentary effect when used with benzodiazepines. Of the available opioids, fentanyl is most commonly used because its lipophilic profile allows for rapid onset, and short half-life. Respiratory depression and the associated increase in the apneic threshold is the most concerning side effect of the use of opioids for sedation, so the reversal agent should always be available when using these medications for anesthesia. 21 Decreased ventilatory drive is even more likely when opioids are used in combination with other sedatives, and care must be taken to avoid oversedation.\nAlthough less potent, alfentanil has a shorter half-life and quicker onset than fentanyl and is emerging as a favorite in the bronchoscopy suite. Greig and colleagues 31 studied midazolam versus alfentanil versus midazolam-alfentanil combination, and found that alfentanil alone provided adequate sedation and cough reduction, whereas the combination had no benefit on sedation or patient tolerance, lending only to a greater risk of desaturation. Another study found significant risk of hypoxemia when alfentanil induction is used before propofol target-controlled infusion and recommended further investigation into potentially safe alfentanil induction doses. 32",

One study found improved patient tolerance in the propofol arm, but otherwise no significant difference has been identified in sedation, cough frequency, overall tolerance, or complications. 40\nIt is worth noting that the use of propofol necessitates continuous patient monitoring either by an anesthesiologist or in the intensive care unit by a critical care physician. Propofol has a relatively narrow therapeutic window between moderate and general anesthesia and has no available reversal agent. Its use should only be used by those with advanced airway training.",

Notably the most common side effects in that arm were delirium and hallucinations. 33 Use of ketamine should be avoided in patients with increased intracranial pressure, central nervous system masses, unstable cardiac disease, or acute angle glaucoma because of the known increase in heart rate and blood pressure associated with ketamine administration. 44",

      "content": "Rigid bronchoscopy is commonly used for interventional pulmonary procedures such as airway stent placement, dilation and foreign body extraction. Most commonly, rigid bronchoscopy is performed under general anesthesia with or without the use of paralysis to assist with decreased respiratory motion. Popular sedation combinations used in this setting have been continuous infusion of propofol and remifentanil or midazolam plus alfentanil. 63 Some institutions have used anesthetic gases, such as isoflurane or sevoflurane, with conversion to intravenous medications once the bronchoscope is in place, as it is an open, shared airway and has the potential to fill the room with volatile gasses. 63,64\nOxygenation techniques vary in rigid bronchoscopy, and anesthetic strategies partially depend on type of ventilation used. Spontaneous ventilation can be achieved via moderate sedation, wherein the patient maintains ventilation, and supplemental oxygen is supplied via the bronchoscope. Anesthetic is typically administered intravenously either via push or continuous infusion. Perrin and colleagues 65 maintained anesthetic titration with repeated injections of propofol, phenoperidine, and diazepam or midazolam, without neuromuscular blockade. Significant hypoxemia was noted in a subset of patients, but a lower rate of postprocedural reintubation was also noted. 64,65 Another study found efficacy of both remifentanil and fentanyl infusion therapy for use in spontaneous assisted ventilation with faster recovery noted in the remifentanil arm. 66\nJet ventilation is frequently used because it allows an open airway and increased ease of bronchoscopic manipulation and less airway motion. This is achieved via high-pressure oxygen administration in short bursts through a catheter in the airway. General anesthesia with neuromuscular blockade is typically used in this situation. 64",

A few special populations exist in which extra precaution and dose adjustments are advised. The elderly typically require smaller doses of sedative medications because of a higher likelihood of poor hepatic metabolism or renal dysfunction and often have prolonged emergence time. 67,68 Similarly, those with known hepatic dysfunction or prolonged circulation time (heart failure) often require reduced doses or slower induction of anesthesia to ovoid\noverdose. Post-lung transplant cystic fibrosis patients, those with history of substance abuse, and any patient with a previous stem cell transplant may require higher doses of sedation. 21,23,69,70 Special care should be given to human immunodeficiency virus patients with protease inhibitors in their antiretroviral regimen, as prolonged sedation has been noted when midazolam is used as a sedative. 71-73 Pregnant women also pose a unique risk for sedation in bronchoscopy. If possible, deferral of the bronchoscopy until after the pregnancy has ended is recommended. If the bronchoscopy must be performed, consulting a pharmacist and obstetrician is recommended to support the choice of sedative medications. The lowest effective dose of medication should be administered. If conscious sedation is required, careful avoidance of class D or class X medications (including midazolam and diazepam) is stressed. Cardiac and fetal monitoring are recommended during the procedure. 74",

      "title": "BRONCHOSCOPY IN THE PEDIATRIC POPULATION",
      "content": "Flexible bronchoscopy is performed in children primarily for diagnostic evaluation of benign diseases such as airway inflammatory or infectious conditions, or airway anatomic lesions, many of which are dynamic and sleep state dependent. Interventional procedures may also be performed. According to recently published technical standards for flexible airway endoscopy in children, the goals for sedation include (1) provision of patient comfort, (2) maintenance of hemodynamic stability, (3) maintenance of adequate gas exchange, and (4) provision of satisfactory conditions for therapeutic or diagnostic endoscopy. 75 Infants and young children have increased risks, and structured sedation protocols are recommended to reduce morbidity. 76 Upper airway obstruction may occur because of larger tongue size relative to the upper airway, a higher and more anterior larynx, and a greater ratio of instrument size to airway size. Infants and young children have a decreased apneic time because of decreased oxygen stores, increased oxygen utilization, and exaggerated effects on respiratory drive. 77 Immaturity in hepatic and renal function affects metabolism and clearance of intravenous agents in neonates and premature infants. 76,78 Choice of anesthetic or sedative agent can impact risks and diagnostic accuracy.\nThere are no specific sedation guidelines for pediatric flexible bronchoscopy. Diagnostic procedures are typically done with maintenance of spontaneous breathing, although pediatric bronchoscopy is typically done with deep rather than moderate sedation.\nThis can be accomplished with inhaled sevoflurane, and titration of depth and recovery are brisk. 79-81 Weaknesses include anesthetic pollution of the surgical environment and dose-dependent reduction in airway tone, especially at the level of the soft palate. 82,83 Sevoflurane induction and maintenance of anesthesia can also be supplemented with intravenous agents if desired. Multiple total intravenous anesthesia combinations, most often of a hypnotic plus ultra-short-acting opioid, have been evaluated and found to be safe and provide rapid onset, good control of patient movements, maintenance of oxygenation, and hemodynamic stability. 79,81-84 Comparisons between inhaled and intravenous anesthesia suggest longer recovery times with intravenous management. 79,81 A comparison of sevoflurane and propofol found a higher rate of laryngospasm with sevoflurane and increased cough and expiration reflex with propofol, independent of level of hypnosis by bispectral index score. 85\nThe level of sedation is driven in large part by the goals of the procedure. For procedures that are for the primary purpose of obtaining bronchoalveolar lavage or interventional procedures, deeper sedation does not adversely affect the procedural result. For evaluation of dynamic airway obstruction, especially for drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) to plan surgical intervention, sedation level, and effect of agent on airway tone is of paramount importance. A comprehensive review by Ehsan and colleagues 82 details the variable impact of topical and inhaled anesthetics, hypnotics, and opioids on upper airway tone, size, sleep state, and reflexes. Overall, dexmedetomidine simulates non-rapid eye movement sleep and causes less loss of upper airway cross-sectional area than propofol but with a longer recovery time. 86-89 Ketamine causes relatively less upper airway collapsibility or suppression of respiratory drive. 90 A comparison of a dexmedetomidine-ketamine protocol with propofol alone or sevoflurane-propofol for DISE resulted in a lower rate of desaturation and a higher rate of successful completion. 91 Overall, there is no clearly superior approach to sedation for pediatric flexible bronchoscopy, although the approach needs to be tailored to safety, the goals of the procedure, and the surgical environment.",

      "content": "Maintaining the desired level of sedation during bronchoscopic procedures is complex, and several studies have evaluated sedation assessment intraprocedurally. Most of these assessments were subjective, based solely on patient response to stimulation, but more recently, bronchoscopists\nand anesthesiologists have used the bispectral index scoring (BIS) as an objective measurement of the depth of anesthesia. Fadaizadeh and colleagues 92 suggest a mean BIS level of 40 to 60 for flexible bronchoscopic sedation. Powers and colleagues 93 defined a similar target BIS level in children.\nThere is ongoing debate about the safety of anesthesia-administered versus proceduralistadministered sedation, but current evidence suggests that both are safe and that endoscopistadministered sedation is more cost effective, especially if a protocol is in place. 94-98",

      "content": "Sedation is generally recommended for all patients undergoing bronchoscopic procedures, unless contraindications exist. There is no standardized practice, and almost any combination is acceptable with few adverse effects. The ideal sedative should be safe and predictable, with a rapid onset and recovery, with an available reversal agent. Ultimately the sedation regimen used remains at the discretion of the bronchoscopist.",
