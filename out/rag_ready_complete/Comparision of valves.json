      "content": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) is a leading and growing cause of worldwide morbidity and mortality [1 -3]. In the year 2017 alone, 3.2 million deaths due to Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were recorded, making Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) the third leading\nThomas Sgarbossa, thomas.sgarbossa\ncause of death worldwide [4]. An especially severe form of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the development of advanced lung emphysema. Chronic in /uniFB02 ammationinthe small airways causes remodeling and narrowing of the airway walls. This in /uniFB02 ammation is frequently due to inhaling noxious fumes, with cigarette smoke being the most common cause for the development of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [5, 6]. These pathophysiological mechanisms underlying chronic in /uniFB02 ammation lead to air entrapment within the narrower airways in the small alveoli [7]. Over time, this causes the destruction of the alveolar walls, resulting in hyperin /uniFB02 ation and potentially severe limitations to gas exchange [1, 8]. For this reason, patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and severe lung emphysema often suffer from severe dyspnea, exercise intolerance, and a reduced quality of life [9].\nLung volume reduction therapy has become a treatment option for a highly selected group of patients suffering from advanced forms of lung emphysema and can lead to signi /uniFB01 cant improvements in lung function, exercise capacity, and quality of life of these patients [10, 11]. In a highly selected group of patients, lung volume reduction can lead to signi /uniFB01 cant improvements in lung function, exercise capacity, and quality of life. The process of endoscopic lung volume reduction (ELVR) with one-way valves was established in clinical practice after several high-pro /uniFB01 le randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrated positive outcomes and a good safety signal, among these RCTs being the LIBERATE and EMPROVE studies [11 -18]. However, one-way valves of different manufacturers were used in these studies, either Zephyr endobronchial valves (EBVs; Pulmonx ® , Redwood City, CA, USA) featuring a duckbill design or the intrabronchial Spiration Valve System (SVS; Olympus ® , Center Valley, PA, USA) featuring an umbrella design.\nTo our knowledge, no systematic analysis has been published previously regarding potential differences or similarities in outcome between these two valve types. Consequently, clinicians choose between the valve types relying on personal experience and availability, rather than on scienti /uniFB01 c evidence. This study employed realworld data provided by three lung emphysema centers in the German lung emphysema registry (LE-Registry), which chose from the two valve types based on bronchial anatomy. We examined whether patients treated with the EBV or SVS experienced comparable clinical bene /uniFB01 ts and risk pro /uniFB01 les for adverse events.",

This registry is an open-label multicenter prospective\nclinical study, which focuses exclusively on patients with severe lung emphysema undergoing a form of lung volume reduction. The stated goal of the registry is to assess and compare outcomes after different types of lung volume reduction independent of any third party. For this analysis, we did not use the whole database but focused on three centers, all of which use both types of valves ad libitum. These centers are the Charité -Universitätsmedizin Berlin, the Gemeinschaftskrankenhaus Havelhöhe, and the Lungenklinik Hemer. Both the Charité -Universitätsmedizin Berlin and Gemeinschaftskrankenhaus Havelhöhe are founding members of the LE-Registry and started including patients in 2017. The Lungenklinik Hemer /uniFB01 rst patients were included in the LE-Registry in 2020.

Patients had to ful /uniFB01 ll the following parameters to be eligible for inclusion in this study: forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) ≤ 45% of predicted value, residual volume (RV) ≥ 180% of predicted value, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) < 55 mm Hg, and 6-min walk distance (6MWD) ≤ 450 m. Prior to ELVR, they had to receive optimal pharmacological treatment of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and provide a proof of smoking abstinence over 3 months (no cotinine levels in urine or carboxyhemoglobin < 2%). Additionally, all patients had to receive an assessment of collateral ventilation by Chartis ® (Pulmonx, Redwood City, CA, USA) and/or by software-dependent analysis of /uniFB01 ssure integrity (StratX Platform [Pulmonx, Redwood City, CA, USA] or VIDA Vision [VIDA Diagnostics, Coralville, IA, USA]) [21 -23].\nExclusion criteria were age below 40 years, inability to provide informed consent, or missing documentation of the valve type used. 15 patients who received both types of valves were also excluded from this study. The respective treatment for each patient was discussed and determined in local multidisciplinary conferences consisting of experienced pulmonologists, thoracic surgeons, and radiologists.\nOnly those patients were included in this study who received ELVR with one-way valves. These were split into two groups based on the type of valve used in the\nprocedure. A follow-up was counted as complete and included in the analysis if there were data entered for the FEV1 and the RV at the follow-up.

When data from the 3-month follow-up were not available for a patient, we used data from the 6-month follow-up if possible. Adverse events were assessed during the /uniFB01 rst 90 days post-intervention with one-way valves. The lung function tests including spirometry, body plethysmography, and measurement of diffusion capacity\nwere performed according to current guidelines [24 -26]. Additionally, the emphysema assessment involved highresolution computer tomography scanning ( -950 or -910 Houns /uniFB01 eld units) and software-based quanti /uniFB01 cation (StratX platform or VIDA Diagnostics) to calculate an emphysema score. After the decision for ELVR with oneway valves was reached in the multidisciplinary conference, either the EBV or the SVS was inserted. Both valve types were always available to the physicians in all sizes. The selection of valve type was made arbitrarily by the physician performing the procedure, unless the underlying bronchial anomaly suggested a clearly superior valve type. In line with current literature, the SVS tended to be preferred in short and round bronchi, while the EBV was preferred for longer and straight bronchi [27].

      "content": "This study aimed to assess the ef /uniFB01 cacy and safety of the two predominant types of one-way valves for ELVR. To our knowledge, this is the /uniFB01 rst study directly comparing these two valve types head-to-head. Regardless of the valve-type employed, we saw a signi /uniFB01 cant improvement in FEV1, RV, and CAT score at the follow-up. Notably, there were no signi /uniFB01 cant discrepancies between the two groups regarding the median change from baseline to follow-up. Furthermore, the rate of adverse events\nremained comparably low in both groups, suggesting no difference in safety pro /uniFB01 les between both valve types.\nWe were able to show positive outcomes for both the SVS and EBV. The choice of valve selection was determined by the physician performing the bronchoscopy based on the unique individual bronchial anatomy of the patient. Both valve types were always available in all sizes to the treating physicians. Data from the three centers were collected using the German lung emphysema registry. This registry is a national, open-label, prospective clinical study which focusses on lung volume reduction\nin patients with severe emphysema. Interestingly, the baseline characteristics of both groups did not differ signi /uniFB01 cantly between each other, underscoring the success of our multicenter approach in establishing two comparable cohorts.\nThe implantation of one-way valves was established in clinical practice following several large and high-pro /uniFB01 le RCTs [12 -16, 18, 35] which successfully demonstrated ef /uniFB01 cacy and safety in the setting of a clinical trial. Other studies were able to show the feasibility and ef /uniFB01 cacy of ELVR for several different groups deemed as high risk.\nData presented as median (IQR) unless indicated otherwise.

The respective RCTs focused exclusively on one type of one-way valve, either the SVS or EBV. The EMPROVE study is one of the more recent studies using SVS in ELVR [12]. In it, Criner et al. were able to show signi /uniFB01 cant improvements in FEV1 of 99 mL and a decrease in RV of 402 mL from baseline to 6month follow-up. Furthermore, they observed a nonsigni /uniFB01 cant decrease of the 6MWD of 4.4 m 6 months after the intervention with SVS. Our real-world data are consistent with these clinical trials and demonstrate comparable /uniFB01 ndings at the follow-up. Patients treated with SVS improved signi /uniFB01 cantly with median Δ FEV1 increase of 110 mL and median Δ RVdecrease by 570 mL. The median Δ 6MWD did improve slightly in our SVS group (6.8 m), albeit also nonsigni /uniFB01 cantly.\nThe LIBERATE study investigated the ef /uniFB01 cacy of EBV valves [13]. At the 12-month follow-up, they reported an increase in FEV1 of 104 mL, a decrease in RV of 490 mL, and an improvement in the 6MWD of 13.0 m. Our /uniFB01 ndings among patients treated with EBV mirror these outcomes, revealing a signi /uniFB01 cant increase in median Δ FEV1 by 100 mL and a decrease of 820 mL in the median Δ RVat follow-up. Additionally, we observed a signi /uniFB01 cant increase of 38 m in the median Δ 6MWD in our EBV patients. Interestingly, DLCO improved in both groups\nData presented as median (IQR).

However, this difference may be attributed to the smaller number of patients treated with SVS compared to EBV. This notion is supported by the fact that there are no signi /uniFB01 cant differences between the EBV and SVS group when directly comparing their median difference from baseline to the follow-up. This suggests a comparable rate of improvement between both groups.\nFurthermore, we saw a signi /uniFB01 cant improvement in quality of life, measured by SGRQ, in our EBV group ( -6.9 points), which is similar to those seen in the LIBERATE study at 12 months [13] ( -7.6 points). Additionally, we detected a comparable signi /uniFB01 cant decrease in the SGRQ of 7.1 points in the SVS patients. In both the SVS group and EBV group, we observed a signi /uniFB01 cant decrease in the severity of symptoms caused by Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as measured by the CAT score. The mMRC score decreased in both groups, with signi /uniFB01 cantly reduction only in EBV patients. Nevertheless, when comparing both groups, we found no signi /uniFB01 cant differences in the degree of improvements in quality of life among them.\nBoth groups present with a good safety pro /uniFB01 le, seen by a low rate of severe adverse events. In the large RCTs, pneumothorax and acute exacerbation of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) emerged as the most frequent adverse events, regardless of valvetype employed [13 -15]. These two serious adverse events were also among the most common in our study and occurred at rates similar to previous clinical trials or at even lower rates [12, 13]. One of the main advantages of ELVR with one-way valves is the possibility of safely removing the valves [37]. The rate of valve explantation in\nthis study was relatively low, with only one EBV patient (1%) and two SVS patients (4%) undergoing valve removal within in the /uniFB01 rst 90 days post-intervention. We observed one death, attributed to device-related complications. Most importantly, no signi /uniFB01 cant differences were observed between the SVS and EBV groups regarding any measured adverse events, suggesting that both valve types do not signi /uniFB01 cantly differ in their rate of serious adverse events.\nThe primary limitation of this study lies in the uneven distribution of valve types used during interventions. As the study is not a RCT, there is potential of bias in the selection of valve type by the performing physician, potentially leading to expert bias. However, the similar baseline characteristics and the multicenter approach employed in this study mitigate this bias to some extent. Still, it seems that physicians tended to prefer the EBV, most likely due to more valves being placed in longer bronchi. This would be line with other, similarly structured, papers where there also tended to be an imbalance towards the EBV [27]. To reach more conclusive conclusions, future randomized studies with more balanced groups are needed. Another limitation pertains to missing data, which is characteristic of studies of this nature. Also characteristic for studies of this type is the loss of followup at 3 months and beyond, this currently limits the signi /uniFB01 cance and number of follow-ups available for the analysis. We saw a higher rate of loss of follow-up in the SVS group, which could skew results. Due to the nature of the registry, several interesting parameters (e.g., target lobe lung volume pre- and post-intervention, procedure\nHighlighted p value indicates statistically signi /uniFB01 cant results.

Additionally, there is no guarantee that all serious adverse events and mortalities were consistently tracked and reported by the study centers.",
