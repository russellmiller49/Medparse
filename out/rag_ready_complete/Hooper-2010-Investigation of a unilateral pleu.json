      "content": "Pleural effusions are a common medical problem with more than 50 recognised causes including disease local to the pleura or underlying lung, systemic conditions, organ dysfunction and drugs. 1\nPleural effusions occur as a result of increased /uniFB02 uid formation and/or reduced /uniFB02 uid resorption. The precise pathophysiology of /uniFB02 uid accumulation varies according to underlying aetiologies. As the differential diagnosis for a unilateral pleural effusion is wide, a systematic approach to investigation is necessary. The aim is to establish a diagnosis swiftly while minimising unnecessary invasive investigations and facilitating treatment, avoiding the need for repeated therapeutic aspirations when possible.\nSince the 2003 guideline, several clinically relevant studies have been published, allowing new recommendations regarding image guidance of pleural procedures with clear bene /uniFB01 ts to patient comfort and safety, optimum pleural /uniFB02 uid sampling and processing and the particular value of thoracoscopic pleural biopsies. This guideline also includes a review of recent evidence for the use of new biomarkers including N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), mesothelin and surrogate markers of tuberculous pleuritis.",

( U )\n< An accurate drug history should be taken during clinical assessment. ( U )\nThe history and physical examination of a patient with a pleural effusion may guide the clinician as to whether the effusion is a transudate or an exudate. This critical distinction narrows the differential diagnosis and directs further investigation.\nClinical assessment alone is often capable of identifying transudative effusions. Therefore, in an appropriate clinical setting such as left ventricular failure with a con /uniFB01 rmatory chest x-ray, such effusions do not need to be sampled unless there are atypical features or they fail to respond to treatment.\nApproximately 75% of patients with pulmonary embolism and pleural effusion have a history of pleuritic pain. These effusions tend to occupy less than one-third of the hemithorax and the dyspnoea\nis often out of proportion to the size of the effusion. 2 3 As tests on the pleural /uniFB02 uid are unhelpful in diagnosing pulmonary embolism, a high index of suspicion is required to avoid missing the diagnosis.\nThe patient ' s drug history is also important. Although uncommon, a number of medications have been reported to cause exudative pleural effusions (box 1). Useful resources for more detailed information include the British National Formulary and the web site http://www.pneumotox.com/.\nAn occupational history including details about known or suspected asbestos exposure and potential secondary exposure via parents or spouses should be documented.

However, only 50 ml of pleural /uniFB02 uid can produce detectable posterior costophrenic angle blunting on a lateral chest x-ray. 4\nIn the intensive care setting, most chest x-rays are performed as AP supine examinations, resulting in free pleural /uniFB02 uid lying posteriorly in the dependent portion of the chest.

A meta-analysis of studies examining pleural pH and the need for chest tube drainage or surgery in patients with a parapneumonic effusion found that a pH < 7.2 was the most speci /uniFB01 c discriminator of complicated pleural infection. 54 This is covered in detail in the pleural infection guideline.\nIn loculated parapneumonic effusions, /uniFB02 uid pH has been shown to vary signi /uniFB01 cantly between locules so that a pH > 7.2 in a patient with other clinical indicators of complicated pleural infection should be viewed with caution. 55\nThe collection and analysis technique can have a clinically signi /uniFB01 cant impact on pleural /uniFB02 uid pH results. A prospective study found that exposure of /uniFB02 uid to air in the syringe increased the measured pleural /uniFB02 uid pH by $ 0.05 in 71% of samples and inclusion of 0.2 ml local anaesthetic produced a mean reduction in pH of 0.15 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.18). 56 Pleural /uniFB02 uid should therefore be collected and transported without exposure to atmospheric air and local anaesthetic avoided for diagnostic aspirations where the pH will be used to guide management. Pleural pH does not change signi /uniFB01 cantly if processing is delayed for up to an hour at room temperature. An arterial blood gas analyser should be used. 57 In routine clinical practice it is often dif /uniFB01 cult to adhere to these collection requirements and, when they cannot be achieved, overall clinical assessment may be preferable to reliance on a suboptimal pleural /uniFB02 uid pH result.",

An image-guided cutting needle biopsy allows that focal area of abnormality to be biopsied. It has a higher yield than that of blind pleural biopsy in the diagnosis of malignancy. This technique is particularly useful in patients who are unsuitable for thoracoscopy.\nPleural malignant deposits tend to predominate close to the midline and diaphragm, which are areas best avoided when performing an Abrams biopsy. However, these anatomical regions are possible to biopsy safely under radiological imaging.

The prevalence is dose-related with a shorter latency period than other asbestos-related disorders. 155 The effusion is usually small and asymptomatic, often with pleural /uniFB02 uid which is haemorrhagic. 156 157 There is a propensity for the effusion to resolve within 6 months, leaving behind residual diffuse pleural thickening. 156 157 As there are no de /uniFB01 nitive tests, the diagnosis can only be made with certainty after a prolonged period of follow-up and consideration should be given to early thoracoscopy with pleural biopsy in any patient with a pleural effusion and a history of asbestos exposure, particularly in the presence of chest pain.

A retrospective study of 75 such patients found that only 8.3% of these turned out to be malignant over a 2-year follow-up period. The majority of patients with non-speci /uniFB01 c pleuritis (91.7%) followed a benign course, with spontaneous resolution of the effusion in 81.8% of cases. 163\nIn patients not /uniFB01 t enough for thoracoscopy, it is sensible to reconsider diagnoses with a speci /uniFB01 c treatment (eg, TB, pulmonary embolism, lymphoma and chronic heart failure). A considerable number of undiagnosed pleural effusions in this category are due to a malignant process. Watchful waiting may be the appropriate management in this setting.\nCompeting interests No member of the Guideline Group is aware of any competing interests.\nProvenance and peer review The draft guideline was available for online public consultation (July/August 2009) and presented to the BTS Winter Meeting (December 2009).
