These factors contribute to an increased need for minimally invasive devices and procedures able to obtain diagnostic tissue and facilitate a quick path to treatment.\nElectromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) displays images of the tracheobronchial tree to aid the physician in guiding specialized endoscopic tools to lung targets. 8 ENB has been used to aid in the biopsy of peripheral lung lesions and lymph nodes and in placing /uniFB01 ducial markers or\nABBREVIATIONS: Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) = endobronchial ultrasound; ENB = electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy; ENB-SD = electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy-superDimension navigation system; ENB-VM = Veran Medical Technologies ' electromagnetic navigation system; TTNA = transthoracic needle aspiration\nAFFILIATIONS: From The Department of Pulmonary Medicine (Dr Mehta), Respiratory Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH; Medical Affairs (Dr Hood), Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN; Pulmonary Institute (Dr Schwarz), Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv,\nIsrael; and the Department of Radiology (Dr Solomon), Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.\nCORRESPONDENCE TO: Atul C.

      "title": "The History of Intraprocedural Image Navigation",
      "content": "Before there was electromagnetic navigation, the /uniFB01 eld of image-guided surgery was mostly developed using mechanical and optical systems that would track surgical instruments and display them on previously acquired images. With mechanical systems, position was judged on the basis of the joint position of an articulated, surgical arm or a coordinate-based frame. 11-15 With optical systems, re /uniFB02 ectors were attached to surgical instruments and their positions were triangulated by optical cameras located in the room (passive tracking) or light-emitting diodes that were attached to the patient and instruments and then detected by a camera (active tracking). 16 This work was mostly done in the neurosurgical realm where the skull was /uniFB01 xed and motion concerns with respiration or heart beats were not at issue.\nAlthough optical and mechanical tracking systems are still used today in certain clinical situations, there were two limitations that have made them not as useful with /uniFB02 exible-type instruments such as a bronchoscope. The /uniFB01 rst limitation was that with the tools had to be rigid. Both systems used knowledge of the proximal part of the instrument to determine where the instrument tip was located. With the mechanical tracking system, it was the angulation of the joint that located the proximal end; with the optical system, it was where the re /uniFB02 ectors were located on the surgical instrument. The second limitation was that optical systems required a direct line of sight to the instrumentation, which obviously limited internal instrumentation where the external cameras could not ' see ' them.\nThe initial electromagnetic tracking systems were applied in neurosurgery and sinus surgery; however, the electromagnetic sensor size was not well suited for endoscope tips. 17,18 It was not until miniature sensors were developed that applications that relied on /uniFB02 exible instruments such as catheters and endoscopes could be applied.",

      "title": "Historical Roots in Electromagnetic Theory",
      "content": "Electromagnetic tracking devices are used in a variety of applications in medicine, such as neurosurgery, urology,\nendonasal procedures, and cardiac procedures. 19 The basic concept consists of a /uniFB01 eld generator that generates a spatially changing (varying in magnitude and direction multiple times per second) electromagnetic /uniFB01 eld, and a sensory probe containing coiled wire(s) or other magnetometers. When the sensory probe is introduced into the magnetic /uniFB01 eld, it induces a voltage whose strength and polarity re /uniFB02 ect the probe ' s position and orientation within the electromagnetic /uniFB01 eld. 19-21\nAlthough it is impossible to brie /uniFB02 y describe the centuries of scienti /uniFB01 c discoveries leading up to this technology, the ability to generate and detect electromagnetic /uniFB01 elds is largely made on the basis of the collective works of Ampère, Biot and Savart, and Faraday. To track the position of the sensor probe, one must /uniFB01 rst understand the geometry of the electromagnetic /uniFB01 eld. This was made possible by André-Marie Ampère (1820), who described the electromagnetic effect as the force that one current exerts upon another. Biot and Savart further de /uniFB01 ned this effect in 1824 by mathematically modeling the magnetic /uniFB01 eld generated by an electric current. 22 Also, once the reference /uniFB01 eld is known, one must be able to detect it via the sensor probe through magnetic induction. It was Michael Faraday in 1831 who proved empirically that a changing magnetic /uniFB01 eld induces an electric current inside a coil that can be detected. 22 In 1832, Joseph Henry further developed the practical application of Faraday ' s work. 22",

      "title": "The Origins of Electromagnetic Navigation in the Lung",
      "content": "The /uniFB01 rst electromagnetic navigation in the lung was developed by a Johns Hopkins radiology resident, Stephen Solomon, and colleagues. Solomon (Fig 1A) was developing an intrabody navigation system that used electromagnetic /uniFB01 elds to track sensors attached to the tip of surgical instruments. This work was done with a small company called Biosense that was later purchased by Johnson & Johnson. The sensor detected the real-time location, orientation, and movement of the instrument and displayed it on a previously acquired CT, MRI, or /uniFB02 uoroscopic image. The method was /uniFB01 rst applied in hepatic shunt procedures 23,24 and cardiac catheters. 20\nSolomon adapted the technology for use in pulmonology and published the /uniFB01 rst conceptual study in swine in 1998, noting that real-time bronchoscopic positioning by ENB could complement CT-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (Fig 1B). 21 His work led to his being awarded the Young Investigator Award\n]\nand the Cecile Lehman Mayer Finalist award at the XIX World Congress on Diseases of the Chest and the 64th Annual International Scienti /uniFB01 c Assembly of the American College of Chest Physicians in 1998. Work with Dr Ko Pen Wang optimized the registration method, the process of aligning the patient ' s anatomy with the previously acquired images, using a technique of touching the wall of the trachea with the bronchoscope, which was found to be more accurate than the previous method that used metallic skin markers (Fig 1C, 1D). 25\nThe /uniFB01 rst commercial ENB system was developed in Herzliya, Israel, by Pinchas Gilboa. 26 Gilboa had designed electromagnetic navigation systems for Israeli defense systems and established superDimension in 1995 as a toy company using an enhanced version of the navigation technology for computer-active games. 26 Gilboa joined with David Tolkowsky (son of Dan Tolkowsky, commander of the Israeli Air Force from 1953 to 1958) in 1996 (Fig 2); in 1998, they shifted the\nfocus of the technology to image-guided interventional cardiology. 26\nIn 2001, Gilboa and Tolkowsky moved the technology into interventional pulmonology, adding steerable catheter, three-dimensional image processing, and image-to-body algorithmic registration to their system. 26",

      "content": "The /uniFB01 rst use in man of an electromagnetic bronchoscope was performed with the Solomon group. Next, a clinical team including Atul Mehta, Ko Pen Wang, Praveen Mathur, Peter White, and Charlie Wiener were assembled to design a multicenter trial. The lack of funding limited further study with this sensor. The /uniFB01 rst human study with the ENB-SD system was performed in Israel in June 2003. A few weeks later, the /uniFB01 rst clinical study was initiated in Thoraxklinic, Heidelberg, Germany (July 28-29, 2003), under the guidance of Drs Yehuda Schwarz and Heinrich Becker (Fig 4). Thirteen subjects were included. Positive biopsy diagnoses were obtained in 9/13 cases, and there were no complications. The average navigation accuracy was 5.7 mm. 28 A second study of 30 subjects was subsequently conducted, with conclusive biopsies in 20/29 cases and only one pneumothorax. 29\nDuring the same timeframe, a second electromagnetic navigations system, the Aurora electromagnetic tracking device (Northern Digital, Waterloo, ON, Canada), was described by Dr Hubert Hautmann at the Medizinische Klinik in 2005 (Fig 5). Dr Hautmann and colleagues 30 conducted a study in 16 patients and reported that the system was able to identify all lesions, supporting the ability of ENB to improve the yield of bronchoscopic procedures.\nThe /uniFB01 rst large-scale prospective clinical study using the ENB-SD system was published from the Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, in 2006. 31 This was a prospective study of 60 subjects with peripheral lung lesions (n ¼ 54) or lymph nodes (n ¼ 31). More than one-half (57%)\nof the lesions were < 2 cm in diameter. ENB was conducted in 58 subjects with a diagnostic yield of 74% for lung lesions and 100% for lymph nodes. Pneumothorax occurred in two subjects (3.5%). The /uniFB01 rst generation of the ENB-SD system was cleared for use in both Europe (2002) and the United States (2004).\nA third system, developed by Veran Medical Technologies, originated with the SPiN Interventional Radiology device in May 2006. This was followed by\nboth percutaneous and bronchoscopic (Fig 6) electromagnetic tracking systems (ENB-Veran Medical [VM]) that use real-time procedure scans to account for respiratory gating. 32 A 2016 pilot study of the ENB-VM system for transthoracic needle aspiration (TTNA) guidance was published in 2016 and demonstrated that ENB-guided TTNA was feasible, with no bleeding events and a 21% pneumothorax rate (8% requiring chest tube). The diagnostic yield was 33% for navigational bronchoscopy alone, 83% for ENB-guided TTNA alone, and 87% when the two technologies were combined. 33 A second study by Flenaugh and Mohammed 34 enrolled 44 patients and reported a diagnostic yield of 37/41 (90.2%) using the bronchoscopic ENB-VM system.",

      "title": "ENB Technology Takes Off",
      "content": "Following publication of the initial clinical studies in 2006, clinical research into the safety and ef /uniFB01 cacy of ENB increased at a rapid rate. To date, there have been 63 clinical research studies published on the ENB-SD system 28,29,31,35-93 and eight clinical studies published on ENB-VM systems. 33,94-100\nDiagnostic yield of ENB to aid in the sampling of suspicious lung lesions had been examined in > 30 clinical studies and ranges from 33% to 97% (Fig 7), 28,29,31,33,35-39,41,43-62,64,66,94,95 with most\nstudies reporting diagnostic yields between 67% and 84% (quartile 1-quartile 3). Diagnostic yield of navigated bronchoscopy is similar between the two commercially available systems (Fig 7). One large retrospective registry observed lower diagnostic yield rates than typically reported, but this study used a different de /uniFB01 nition of diagnostic yield than most studies and did not include follow-up of true-negative diagnoses over time. 58\nAdverse events following ENB procedures are uncommon. Pneumothorax is the most frequently reported complication, with pooled rates typically around 3% 101 and much lower than the 20% rate reported for transthoracic needle biopsy 102 and ENBguided TTNA. 33 These results were corroborated by the recently reported Clinical Evaluation of superDimension Navigation System for Electromagnetic Navigation Bronchoscopy study, the largest prospective, multicenter ENB study conducted to date. In 1,000 patients, the ENB-related pneumothorax rates were 4.9% overall and 3.2% for pneumothorax requiring chest tube or hospitalization. 89,92 The safety of ENB has also been demonstrated in high-risk patients with severe Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 93\nAn increasing body of literature has also been published on the use of the ENB-SD system (Fig 8) to aid in /uniFB01 ducial marker placement to guide stereotactic body radiation therapy, 76-86,103-106 pleural dye marking in\n]\npreparation for surgical resection, 67-75,107,108 tissue collection for molecular pro /uniFB01 ling, 87,90 and mediastinal lymph node sampling. 42 Because ENB can be done in the operating room at the time of resection, it can allow greater /uniFB02 exibility and ef /uniFB01 ciency. One study compared ENB-SD -guided dye localization to CT-guided wire localization before minimally invasive video-assisted or robot-assisted thoracic surgery. Although localization time was similar between methods, the time from localization to surgery was signi /uniFB01 cantly shorter for\nENB-guided localization because of shorter down time (189 mi vs 26 min). 109 The ENB-VM system has also been investigated for navigated percutaneous thermal ablation 98 and ENB-guided TTNA. 33,97 The learning curve of ENB has also shown to be acceptable. In a study of the ENB-VM system, diagnostic yield was 80% in the /uniFB01 rst 25 patients enrolled compared with 87% in the last 23 subjects enrolled. 95 Very similar results were reported using the ENB-SD system, with diagnostic yields of 80% vs 87.5% in the /uniFB01 rst 30 and last 30 subjects,\nrespectively. 51 In this way, ENB provides a user-friendly, integrated approach to aid in the diagnosis of suspicious lung lesions and prepare for treatment in the same minimally invasive setting. Some studies have suggested that the ability of ENB to diagnose smaller, more peripheral lesions may aid physicians in diagnosing lung cancer at earlier stages of disease, when it is more amenable to treatment. 46,88 Lung cancer diagnosis at earlier stages of disease has also been associated with signi /uniFB01 cantly lower treatment costs. 110\nIn recent years, increased user experience, knowledge into the factors contributing to improved diagnostic yield, and product advancements have provided better performance of the technology in a variety of clinical settings. Lesion size, 37,38,47,55,58 lesion location, 36,44,53,58 use of rapid on-site pathology evaluation, 36,48,52 presence of a bronchus sign on CT scan, 36,62 concurrent use of radial endobronchial ultrasound (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)) to con /uniFB01 rm lesion location, 43,45 use of catheter aspiration, 45,58 and user experience and volume 47 have all shown to be predictors of better ENB outcomes.\nAlthough improved user experience has resulted in ENB diagnostic yields in the high 80% 55,60 and mid90% 48,52,56 range in some single-center studies, the diagnostic yield of ENB is generally lower than that of transthoracic needle biopsy (range, 75% to 97%; pooled\nrate, 92% across 48 studies). 102 Although complication rates are higher with transthoracic biopsy, 111 the lower diagnostic yield has limited the adoption of ENB by some centers. For this reason, technology improvements in both of the two major ENB systems have been introduced to improve yield and performance. 8,10,112 The ENB-VM system includes sensory tracking tips built into biopsy instruments to allow real-time tracking of biopsy tools. It has also introduced upgrades to its thoracic navigation system to track moving targets during respiration. In addition, the ENB-VM system includes the ability to switch to navigated TTNA in the same procedure as navigated bronchoscopy, as well as simultaneous navigation with radial Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS). The ENB-SD system has introduced seven upgrades to the operating system or software since 2004, including a /uniFB01 ducial marker guidance system. 113 The ENB-SD system also has a transbronchial access tool to reach lesions outside the bronchial airways. 65,114 The newest version of the ENB-SD system adds software algorithms to enhance the visibility of the target region with three-dimensional /uniFB02 uoroscopy and to compensate for CT-to-body divergence (Fig 9). Novel robotic technologies, such as the Monarch (Auris Health) and ION (Intuitive Surgical) 115 robotic endoscopy platforms, use a /uniFB02 exible robotic endoscopy system to reach peripheral lung lesions and are in the early stages of clinical evaluation.\n]",

      "content": "Since the initial inception of the technology in the mid1990s, research into the ideal patient, lesion, user, and technological factors in /uniFB02 uencing ENB performance have come far. Going forward, continued unmet needs include continuous guidance, real-time con /uniFB01 rmation and visualization of lesion location, advanced tools and imaging to locate and access challenging lesions, and seamless integration of concurrent imaging such as CT /uniFB02 uoroscopy and cone-beam CT scans. 10 Technological advancements to enable bronchoscopic ENB-guided ablation are also being explored. Improved technology will allow a more accurate, ef /uniFB01 cient, and streamlined procedure with a shorter time to pro /uniFB01 ciency. ENB will be an invaluable adjunct to transparenchymal lung biopsy, robotic bronchoscopy, and use of cone-beam CT scans. 65,109,118\nIn addition, a better understanding is needed of the patient and lesion characteristics most ideally suited to ENB-aided biopsy. Despite the publication of > 60 clinical studies on ENB use, most studies to date have been single-center, retrospective, and included generally < 100 patients. The prospective, multicenter Clinical Evaluation of superDimension Navigation System for Electromagnetic Navigation Bronchoscopy study, which will enroll up to 1,500 patients at 37 sites in the United States and Europe, will help to answer many of these questions. 89 The study has currently published preliminary 1-month safety data on the /uniFB01 rst 1,000 subjects enrolled 92 and will publish 1-year diagnostic yield data in 2018. Planned multivariate and subgroup analyses on the predictors of diagnostic yield, as well as ENB use for /uniFB01 ducial marker placement, pleural dye marking, and tissue capture for molecular pro /uniFB01 ling, will help de /uniFB01 ne the ideal ENB patient. The cost of the technology could be prohibitive in certain parts of the world; however, increasing expertise will improve both diagnostic yield and cost effectiveness.
