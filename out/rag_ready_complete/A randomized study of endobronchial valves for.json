    "abstract": "Background Endobronchial valves that allow air to escape from a pulmonary lobe but not enter it can induce a reduction in lobar volume that may thereby improve lung function and exercise tolerance in patients with pulmonary hyperinflation related to advanced emphysema.\nMethods We compared the safety and efficacy of endobronchial-valve therapy in patients with heterogeneous emphysema versus standard medical care. Efficacy end points were percent changes in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and the 6-minute walk test on intention-to-treat analysis. We assessed safety on the basis of the rate of a composite of six major complications.\nResults Of 321 enrolled patients, 220 were randomly assigned to receive endobronchial valves (EBV group) and 101 to receive standard medical care (control group). At 6 months, there was an increase of 4.3% in the FEV1 in the EBV group (an increase of 1.0 percentage point in the percent of the predicted value), as compared with a decrease of 2.5% in the control group (a decrease of 0.9 percentage point in the percent of the predicted value). Thus, there was a mean between-group difference of 6.8% in the FEV1 (P = 0.005). Roughly similar between-group differences were observed for the 6-minute walk test. At 12 months, the rate of the complications composite was 10.3% in the EBV group versus 4.6% in the control group (P= 0.17). At 90 days, in the EBV group, as compared with the control group, there were increased rates of exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) requiring hospitalization (7.9% vs. 1.1%, P = 0.03) and hemoptysis (6.1% vs. 0%, P = 0.01). The rate of pneumonia in the target lobe in the EBV group was 4.2% at 12 months. Greater radiographic evidence of emphysema heterogeneity and fissure completeness was associated with an enhanced response to treatment.\nConclusions Endobronchial-valve treatment for advanced heterogeneous emphysema induced modest improvements in lung function, exercise tolerance, and symptoms at the cost of more frequent exacerbations of COPD, pneumonia, and hemoptysis after implantation.

Lung-volume-reduction surgery, in which selected areas of hyperinflated  lungs  are  resected,  improves  exercise tolerance and prolongs life in selected patients. However, concern regarding the risk of perioperative  death  and  complications  contributes  to underutilization. 1-4 Less invasive bronchoscopic techniques that are based on the presumed physiological  effects  of  lung-volume-reduction  surgery have been developed. 5-10 Early uncontrolled trials  using  unidirectional  valves  placed  in  selected  lung  airways  to  block  regional  inflation while allowing exhalation have reported improvements in lung function and symptoms with modest risk, including distal pneumonia or pneumothorax. 5,6,9,11-13\nIn this randomized, prospective, multicenter study,  called  the  Endobronchial  Valve  for  Emphysema Palliation Trial (VENT), we sought to determine the safety and efficacy of unilateral treatment  with  endobronchial  valves,  as  compared with standard medical care, in improving coprimary outcome measures of expiratory flow and  walk  distance  in  patients  with  advanced emphysema.",

All patients provided written informed consent before screening.\nEligibility criteria included an age of 40 to 75 years, a diagnosis of heterogeneous emphysema, a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) of 15 to 45% of the predicted value, a total lung capacity  of  more  than  100%  of  the  predicted value, a residual volume of more than 150% of the predicted value, a body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) of 31.1 or less for men or 32.3 or less\nfor women, a PaCO 2 of less than 50 mm Hg and a partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 ) of more than 45 mm Hg (while breathing ambient air), and a post-rehabilitation 6-minute walk distance of at least 140 m (459 ft).

Success was defined in the intention-to-treat analysis for both primary outcome measures, with a P value of less than 0.05 indicating statistical significance on a two-sided test. The primary safety end point was met if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for the between-group difference in the rate of the complications  composite  was  less  than  30%.

In follow-up from 6 to 12 months, the rate of the complications composite among patients in the EBV group (4.7%) was similar to that in the control group (4.6%), resulting in an overall rate at 12 months of 10.3% in the EBV group and 4.6% in the control group (P  =  0.17).

Cause  of  death  included  respiratory failure not associated with the EBV procedure (in  three  patients),  cancer  (in  one),  ischemic colitis (in one), and massive hemoptysis (in one). The rates of death from any cause by 12 months were similar in the two groups: 3.7% in the EBV group and 3.5% in the control group (P  =  0.88 by the log-rank test).

FEV 1 denotes forced expiratory volume in 1 second.\n† All P values are two-sided.\nsema. Overall, there were modest improvements in quality of life, dyspnea, incremental exercise response, and supplemental oxygen use. Although the overall magnitude of effect was modest, high values for disease heterogeneity and fissure integrity  on  CT  imaging  were  more  common  in patients who had a clinically important response. The dominant adverse event driving a quantitative increase in the rate of adverse events in the EBV group versus the control group was the 4.2% incidence of pneumonia distal to the valves, confirming previous reports. 5,6,9,11-13 Other adverse events,  which  were  increased  in  the  periprocedural period after valve placement, included an increased rate of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations requiring hospitalization, pneumothorax, and hemoptysis related to oozing from granulation tissue.\nSimilar  to  lung-volume-reduction  surgery, endobronchial-valve  therapy  is  associated  with improvements in lung function and with clinical benefits that are greatest in the presence of heterogeneous lung involvement. After reduction of the most severely diseased lung units, expansion of  the  more  viable,  less  emphysematous  nontreated lung results in substantial improvements in  lung  mechanics. 2,6,10,24,25 Among  patients who received endobronchial-valve therapy, those in the high-heterogeneity subgroup had greater improvements in both the FEV 1 and distance on the  6-minute  walk  test  than  did  patients  with lower heterogeneity. This greater response in the high-heterogeneity subgroup supports the use of quantitative HRCT as an important tool in optimizing the selection  of  patients  for  endobronchial-valve therapy.\nCT fissure completeness on HRCT was analyzed as a surrogate for interlobar collaterals, a feature  postulated  to  mitigate  the  beneficial effects of lobar isolation by means of endobronchial-valve therapy. 9,26-34 We confirmed that fissure completeness was associated with improvement  in  FEV 1 (Table  4)  and  the  magnitude  of change in the lobar volume (Fig. S3 in the Sup-\nplementary  Appendix).  The  magnitude  of  this association was strengthened when valves were properly positioned to effect complete lobar isolation. Thus, we speculate that future strategies that are directed at the selection of patients or targeting of lobes to minimize collateral ventilation and to optimize valve positioning to isolate the lobe should further improve the clinical response to endobronchial-valve therapy.\nWe document a reduction  in  the  volume  of the  target  lobe  that  was  associated  with  both volume expansion in the less diseased adjacent lobe as well as improvement in FEV 1 (Fig. S3 in the  Supplementary Appendix). These data thus support mechanisms underlying the physiological and functional improvements seen with endobronchial-valve  therapy  that  are  consistent with  those  previously  identified  with  lung-volume-reduction surgery and preliminary reports on endobronchial-valve therapy. 9,35-39 During the study, both patients and investigators were unaware  of  the  association  between  clinical  outcome measures and changes in quantitative CT measures, which adds further validity to our results in the absence of study-group blinding.\nIn conclusion, unilateral lobar treatment with endobronchial valves resulted in modest improvements in lung function, exercise tolerance, and symptoms in patients with advanced heterogeneous emphysema. These benefits came at a cost of more frequent hemoptysis and Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations in the months after valve implantation. Greater  heterogeneity  of  emphysema  between lobes  and  intact  interlobar  fissures  appear  to identify  patients  with  a  greater  likelihood  of clinically important functional and physiological responses  to  endobronchial-valve  therapy,  but this difference needs to be confirmed in welldesigned clinical trials.\nSupported by Emphasys Medical (now Pulmonx) and a grant (1 P50HL084948, to Dr. Sciurba) from the National Institutes of Health.\nDisclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.",
