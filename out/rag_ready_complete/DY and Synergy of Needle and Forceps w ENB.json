STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a randomized crossover study during ENB performed under moderate sedation. This trial recruited participants with peripheral pulmonary lesions requiring biopsy who were eligible for elective ENB. ENB-guided needle aspiration and forceps biopsy were sequentially performed in a randomized order. The primary outcome was diagnostic yield, defined as the percentage of patients for whom the biopsy provided a specific diagnosis able to inform patient management. The diagnostic yield achieved by each biopsy modality individually and in combination was evaluated. RESULTS: Between December 1, 2021, and November 13, 2023, 142 participants were enrolled and underwent the study procedures. Complete follow-up data were obtained for 140 participants. Diagnostic yield was 44.4% (63 of 142) for forceps biopsy, 51.4% (73 of 142) for needle aspiration (P = .221 vs forceps), and 66.9% (95 of 142) for the combination (P < .001 vs forceps alone, P < .001 vs needle alone). Sensitivities for malignancy were 47.5% (57 of 120) for forceps biopsy and 58.3% (70 of 120) for needle aspiration (P = .074). The combination of the 2 modalities resulted in a significantly improved sensitivity of 71.7% (86 of 120) compared with either individual modality (P < .001 vs forceps alone and needle alone). Pneumothorax occurred in 3.5% (5 of 142) of patients, and 1.4% (2 of 142) developed pneumothorax requiring tube drainage. INTERPRETATION: Our results show that when performing ENB under moderate sedation, the combination of needle aspiration and forceps biopsy significantly improves the diagnostic yield and sensitivity for malignancy compared with each modality alone, with a favorable safety profile.

However, complications are common with TTNB, with pneumothorax reported in over 18% of cases and more than 6% requiring chest tube placement. In addition, some lesions are not technically amenable to this percutaneous approach. 7,8\nOver the last 2 decades, advanced image-guided technologies have been developed to improve the sampling of peripheral lesions with /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopy. 9 Electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy (ENB) is an evolving technique that is widely used. ENB involves generating an electromagnetic /uniFB01 eld around the patient to track biopsy tools and their position vis-à-vis the lesion to improve the diagnostic yield of bronchoscopy. 10 The reported diagnostic yield of ENB ranges from 67% to 84% for peripheral pulmonary lesions, with a markedly lower complication rate ( < 5% for pneumothorax) than TTNB. 11,12\nWhen performing ENB, forceps biopsy and needle aspiration are the most commonly used tissue sampling tools. 13,14 Previous results from nonrandomized studies on guided bronchoscopic biopsy suggest that the choice of biopsy tool can impact diagnostic performance. 15-18 Although previous studies on bronchoscopic biopsy suggested an enhanced diagnostic yield with the use of an aspiration needle, this tool appears to be underused in real-world practice. 16,19 Moreover, its true bene /uniFB01 t in an ENB-speci /uniFB01 c setting is yet to be veri /uniFB01 ed. In clinical practice, the selection of biopsy tools is in /uniFB02 uenced by multiple factors, including the expected ef /uniFB01 cacy and safety of bronchoscopic biopsies, local preferences, market availability, and reimbursement coverage. In particular, the tradeoffs involving procedural cost, time, and complexity of using an additional biopsy",

      "content": "We conducted a randomized crossover study to evaluate the impact of ENB-guided needle aspiration, forceps biopsy, and their combination on diagnostic yield by performing biopsies with both devices in a randomized sequence. Eligible participants were consecutively recruited from Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, a tertiary referral hospital in South Korea. The inclusion criteria were (1) aged $ 18 years; (2) individuals with a suspicious pulmonary lesion requiring de /uniFB01 nitive diagnosis, as determined by the attending pulmonologist or multidisciplinary tumor board; and (3) lesions predicted to be dif /uniFB01 cult to access with conventional bronchoscopy alone but amenable to elective ENB. The exclusion criteria were (1) inability or unwillingness to provide informed consent or comply with the follow-up schedule; (2) participation in an investigational drug or device research study within 90 days of enrollment, with possible interference with this study; (3) contraindications to moderate sedation or allergies to any of the sedatives planned for use or contraindications to the bronchoscopy procedure; (4) those with multiple lesions requiring ENB-guided sampling; (5) signi /uniFB01 cant regression of the lesion on the same-day CT scan obtained for ENB planning; and (6) successful biopsy from a visible endobronchial tumor lesion in patients initially scheduled for ENB, precluding the need for electromagnetic navigation, or failure to perform ENB-guided biopsy due to technical risks or inability. At the institution where the study was conducted, CT scan-guided TTNB was also available as a biopsy modality. The decision to perform ENB as the biopsy method was primarily based on the lesion ' s accessibility via ENB, as judged by the attending pulmonologist. ENB was chosen because of its lower predicted complication rates than the transthoracic approach, particularly when the lesion was considered accessible with ENB. Written informed\nconsent was obtained from all participants before undergoing ENB. This study adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki and all regulatory requirements. The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board of Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (No. B-2112-715-302) and was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identi /uniFB01 er No. NCT05110131).",

This randomization was aimed to balance the confounding effect of a device being a second biopsy modality, which can be penalized as tissue disruption caused by the /uniFB01 rst biopsy modality.

A detailed procedure protocol has been published previously and is available in e-Appendix 1 (Supplementary Methods). 20 On the procedure day, participants underwent paired inspiration/ expiration chest CT scans for software registration and virtual airway route reconstruction. These planning CT scans were independently reviewed by 2 thoracic radiologists to assess lesion size, type, lobe location, lung zone (inner one-third, middle one-third, or outer one-third of the hemithorax), CT scan bronchus sign, and other\n]\nparenchymal /uniFB01 ndings. Procedures were performed under moderate sedation, with IV administration of midazolam and fentanyl at the onset of the procedure, along with local anesthesia using topical 1% lidocaine.\nBased on group allocation, ENB-guided biopsy was /uniFB01 rst attempted at least 3 times with a 22-G or 21-G aspirating needle (INS-0392 or INS-5410; Veran Medical) or forceps (INS-0372; Veran Medical), followed by the same procedure with the other device with at least 3 attempts. There were no protocol-speci /uniFB01 c restrictions on the maximum number of attempts, which was at the discretion of the performing bronchoscopist. All procedures were performed without complementary localization techniques (eg, radial endobronchial ultrasonography [R-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)], /uniFB02 uoroscopy, cone-beam CT scan). ROSE of the specimens was not performed in any of the procedures. This setting re /uniFB02 ects the standard practice of ENB in South Korea, where the study was carried out. Randomizing the biopsy device sequence, controlling the minimum number of attempts, and restricting complementary techniques mitigated potential risks of order effects (eg, in /uniFB02 uence of the /uniFB01 rst biopsy on tissue condition, procedure time spent with the /uniFB01 rst biopsy, and bronchoscopist preference for a particular modality or complementary technique).\nAll participants underwent chest radiograph postprocedurally and the day after the procedure. With ENBguided biopsy, histologic samples from needle aspiration and forceps biopsy, and cytology samples from needle aspiration, were obtained from each participant.

Strict and conservative de /uniFB01 nitions for diagnostic yield were adopted for nonmalignant /uniFB01 ndings to avoid overestimation of performance. Diagnostic yield was de /uniFB01 ned as the proportion of participants whose biopsy yielded a de /uniFB01 nitive diagnosis. A biopsy was considered diagnostic if the specimen established a de /uniFB01 nitive malignancy (true positive) or a speci /uniFB01 c benign diagnosis that suf /uniFB01 ciently represented the lesion and informed further management (true negative). Other /uniFB01 ndings, including nonspeci /uniFB01 c benign tissue (eg, acute/chronic in /uniFB02 ammation) and nondiagnostic results (eg, atypical cells, normal lung\nparenchyma, insuf /uniFB01 cient tissue), were considered nondiagnostic according to conservative de /uniFB01 nitions of yield. 21-23 After the outcome reporting consensus, 21 the primary outcome was determined solely based on the ENB procedural encounter. For all nonmalignant /uniFB01 ndings on ENB, the /uniFB01 nal diagnosis was con /uniFB01 rmed through clinical/radiologic follow-up for 12 months (or until con /uniFB01 rmative diagnosis by an additional procedure or regression without cancer treatment) to con /uniFB01 rm true- or false-negative results. Secondary outcomes included the diagnostic yield of the combined approach compared with needle aspiration alone, sensitivity for malignancy, and the strictly de /uniFB01 ned diagnostic accuracy based on 12-month follow-up results to determine true or false negatives. Participants with nonmalignant ENB results lacking con /uniFB01 rmative follow-up for up to 12 months were excluded from the analyses for sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy. The proportion of successful lesion approach, sampling duration, number of attempts for needle and forceps biopsy, and adverse events related to the ENB procedure were also evaluated. Adverse events were classi /uniFB01 ed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events scale, version 5.0. 24 Pneumothorax was assessed using chest radiograph postprocedurally and the day after the procedure.

Comparisons between allocation groups were performed using Student t test for continuous variables and c 2 test (or Fisher exact test) for categorical variables. Diagnostic yield and accuracy were compared using McNemar test for forceps vs combination, needle vs combination, and needle vs forceps, respectively.

Nine different bronchoscopists successfully completed ENB-guided needle aspiration and forceps biopsy, and complete data with up to 12-months follow-up were obtained for 140 participants (Fig 1). The baseline\ncharacteristics of the participants and biopsied lesions are summarized in Table 1. Characteristics were well balanced between the needle/uniFB01 rst group (n ¼ 71) and forceps/uniFB01 rst group (n ¼ 71). The mean age /C6 SD of the participants was 68.2 /C6 9.0 years, with 84 male participants (59.2%). The mean lesion size /C6 SD was 20.8 /C6 7.7 mm, with 119 (83.8%) solid lesions, 80 (56.3%) located in the upper lobes, 83 (58.5%) in the\nouter one-third of the hemithorax, and 91 (64.1%) with a positive CT scan bronchus sign.

The primary outcome of diagnostic yield for the combined procedure was 66.9% (95 of 142).

In addition, the combination resulted in a signi /uniFB01 cantly higher diagnostic yield than needle aspiration alone (51.4% [73 of 142]; P < .001 vs combination).

In 41 participants (28.9%), both needle aspiration and forceps biopsy established a de /uniFB01 nitive diagnosis. Forceps biopsy failed to establish a diagnosis in 32 cases, of which a diagnosis was established with needle aspiration (non-small cell lung cancer: n ¼ 29, infection/abscess: n ¼ 3). Conversely, needle aspiration failed to establish a diagnosis in 22 cases, for which the diagnosis was determined by forceps biopsy (non-small cell lung cancer: n ¼ 14, carcinoid tumor: n ¼ 1, metastatic carcinoma: n ¼ 1, mycobacterial diseases: n ¼ 3, infection/abscess: n ¼ 1, eosinophilic pneumonia: n ¼ 1, dense anthraco /uniFB01 brosis: n ¼ 1) (e-Fig 1).

Overall, 120 of 140 pulmonary lesions (85.7%) were determined to be malignant. Subgroup analyses of the diagnostic yield of the ENB procedure according to the /uniFB01 nal diagnosis and lesion characteristics are presented in Table 3.

      "content": "The /uniFB01 ndings from our prospective comparative trial showed that when performing ENB under moderate sedation for diagnosing pulmonary lesions, the combination of needle aspiration and forceps biopsy signi /uniFB01 cantly improves the diagnostic yield and sensitivity for malignancy compared with each device alone. To our knowledge, this is the /uniFB01 rst prospective study evaluating the synergistic effect of a combined multimodal approach of needle aspiration and forceps biopsy with strict control of the following methodologic aspects: procedure sequence and process, exclusion of complementary techniques other than ENB (eg, R-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), /uniFB02 uoroscopy), and a strict assessment of diagnostic yield per current recommendations. The use of sole ENB under moderate sedation, without additional guidance techniques or ROSE, is the standard practice in South Korea and many Asian institutions, where advanced bronchoscopic procedures are typically performed without general anesthesia, and the availability of various localization and con /uniFB01 rmation tools is limited. Therefore, our /uniFB01 ndings would be generalizable to settings with similar medical systems and practice patterns. In addition, this study provides valuable insights into the individual contributions of biopsy tools and the implications of discordant results when both devices are used. Given the low complication rate, our results suggest that when ENB is performed under moderate sedation and without\nadjunct imaging guidance, a multimodal biopsy approach should be preferred.\nCurrent guidelines for diagnosing pulmonary lesions recommend that the diagnostic approach should consider factors (eg, lesion characteristics, expected yield of the available procedure, potential risk of complications). 6,28 When performing ENB, the optimal selection of biopsy tools is critically important; however, evidence informing this decision is lacking. To date, forceps biopsy remains the primary modality for tissue sampling, followed by needle aspiration. 14,29,30 Needle aspiration can offer unique advantages in providing extended access beyond the airway, but has limitations in approaching lesions that require passage through sharp angles (eg, lesions in the upper lobes or superior segment of the lower lobes), and is reported to be underused in realworld practice. 16,19 Although previous studies on bronchoscopic sampling suggest that needle aspiration enhances diagnostic yield, its actual bene /uniFB01 t in an ENB-speci /uniFB01 c setting remains unveri /uniFB01 ed. 17,31 A randomized trial by Chao et al 31 reported that in R-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided biopsy for peripheral pulmonary lesions, adding needle aspiration to transbronchial biopsy and bronchial washing signi /uniFB01 cantly increased diagnostic yield. Similarly, data on the bene /uniFB01 t of the multimodal approach, along with benchmark yield and accuracy achieved by each device, would be clinically signi /uniFB01 cant for settings using ENB as the localization technique for peripheral lung lesion biopsy. The Clinical Evaluation of superDimension Navigation System for Electromagnetic Navigation Bronchoscopy (NAVIGATE) study, the largest singlearm prospective ENB study to date, reported that forceps biopsy was used in 83.6% of cases and needle aspiration in 56.6%. 13 In a post hoc analysis assessing the relative contribution of different biopsy tools in 416 participants with proven malignancy by ENB, the true-positive rate was increased by 9.3% by adding forceps biopsy and 5.8% by adding needle aspiration. 14 However, in the full-set analysis of 1,260 cases that underwent ENB-guided biopsy, the number of biopsy tools used did not signi /uniFB01 cantly predict the diagnostic performance. 13 A meta-analysis on ENB studies that evaluated sensitivity as the primary outcome reported a pooled sensitivity of 67% for studies using 1 device and 72% for studies using 2 devices. 12 Nevertheless, most previous studies on ENB were limited by inherent limitations (eg, lack of controlled comparisons between needle aspiration and\nData are presented as No. (%). CTCAE ¼ Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events; ENB ¼ electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy.\n]\nforceps biopsy), hindering the determination of individual contributions of each device and evaluation of the incremental bene /uniFB01 t of combination. These limitations arise from the observational design without prede /uniFB01 ned controls for device selection strategy, usage of complementary localization techniques, and de /uniFB01 nition criteria for diagnostic accuracy measures. 13,16\nIn this study, although the yield for each device appears to be lower than those reported by previous studies on ENB, which reported diagnostic yield between 67% and 80%, 10,11,27 we must consider the strict de /uniFB01 nition criteria for diagnostic yield adopted in this study and the exclusion of complementary localization techniques. Considerable variation exists in the de /uniFB01 nition of diagnostic yield across published studies on diagnostic bronchoscopy. 22,23 A simulation analysis conducted by Vachani et al 32,33 revealed that estimates of diagnostic yield can differ by > 20% when different de /uniFB01 nitions are adopted from the same data set and can be in /uniFB02 uenced by the prevalence of malignancy. The NAVIGATE study initially reported a diagnostic accuracy of 73% based on a liberal de /uniFB01 nition and 1-year follow-up. However, if a strict de /uniFB01 nition is applied, the yield decreased to 49%. 34 Our result of 66.9% diagnostic yield with the combination of needle and forceps compares favorably with other ENB studies that used similar de /uniFB01 nition criteria, which reported yield between 39% and 49%. 16,35 The overall sensitivity of 71.7% aligns with prior reports. 12 When interpreting our results, the prede /uniFB01 ned exclusion of complementary localization techniques (eg, /uniFB02 uoroscopy, R-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)) could potentially confound the yield. The high prevalence of malignancy in this cohort should also be considered because higher prevalence is known to enhance diagnostic yield. 33 Given that the current consensus on reporting outcomes of diagnostic bronchoscopy studies recommends using strict de /uniFB01 nitions for standardization, 21,22 our results provide benchmark yields for ENB-guided needle aspiration, forceps biopsy, and their combination in a minimally invasive setting under moderate sedation, without reliance on additional technologies. The data presented re /uniFB02 ect common practice in our region, where ENB and the 2 most frequently used biopsy tools are used. Moreover, with the strict de /uniFB01 nition applied, the diagnostic yields at index procedure, which is recommended for reporting diagnostic outcomes to allow data publication without delays needed for followup completion, demonstrated excellent concordance with the conservative diagnostic accuracy. 21,23\nNotably, in our study, 38.0% of participants (54 of 142) were nondiagnostic with a single device but were successfully diagnosed with the combination of needle and forceps. It is also noteworthy that the synergistic impact of the combined approach was signi /uniFB01 cant across all subgroups, including lesions < 20 mm and those with a negative bronchus sign, which are established factors associated with lower expected diagnostic yield with ENB. 11,35 Despite the use of both devices, the overall complication rate remained low (3.5% pneumothorax rate, 1.4% requiring chest tube drainage), with no cases of respiratory failure or mortality. This suggests that the combined approach can enhance the diagnostic yield for pulmonary lesions without increasing safety concerns. When performing guided bronchoscopic biopsy, various factors (eg, expected ef /uniFB01 cacy, real-world usage patterns, compatibility with platforms, market availability, additional costs) can in /uniFB02 uence the choice of biopsy tool, posing challenges to adopting a multitool strategy without clear bene /uniFB01 ts. Demonstrating bene /uniFB01 ts with robust methodology is essential for understanding the true value of multimodal biopsy strategies, including novel tools. 36 In addition to our main /uniFB01 ndings, future cost-effectiveness analyses are needed to determine whether the improvements in diagnostic performance justify the additional costs associated with using extra devices, especially in different health care settings.\nOur study has several limitations. First, participants were recruited from a single center in Korea, which may limit generalizability. Our study cohort re /uniFB02 ects the patient population in Korea and represents the minimal setting (moderate sedation without additional techniques and no reliance on ROSE) for performing ENB; therefore, the /uniFB01 ndings may not be directly applicable to other populations undergoing ENB with general anesthesia, adjunct imaging, or con /uniFB01 rmation techniques. Second, the use of multiple biopsy tools precluded a speci /uniFB01 c analysis of complication rates associated with individual tools. This limitation was intentional because the study was designed to prioritize evaluating the synergistic effect and discordance between needle aspiration and forceps biopsy used in ENB. Third, although our primary hypothesis demonstrated statistical signi /uniFB01 cance, our study was not powered to assess potential differences in diagnostic yields between single modalities. Although needle aspiration demonstrated a 7.0% higher diagnostic yield and 10.8% higher sensitivity than forceps biopsy, these differences did not reach statistical signi /uniFB01 cance in this cohort. Regarding direct comparisons, although our\ncrossover design enabled relevant comparisons of each technique and the combined approach within identical lesions, it was important to /uniFB01 nd that the sequence of the 2 techniques did not in /uniFB02 uence the diagnostic yield of each technique.",
