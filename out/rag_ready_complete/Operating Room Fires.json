      "content": "O perating room fires are devastating events that occur at least 650 times annually. 1 These 'never events' result in at least two to three patient deaths per year and not only affect the patient but impact the entire operating room team and hospital system. 2,3 Surgical fires have recently garnered significant media attention and are a source of an increasing number of surgical liability claims: from less than 1% in the late  1980s  to  almost  5%  between  2000  and  2009. 4,5 This change is echoed by an increasing number of voluntarily reported surgical device-related fires in the Food and Drug Administration's  (Silver  Spring,  Maryland)  Manufacturer and User Device Experience database. 6  (fig. 1)\nWritten and video-based guidelines on fire prevention are available from the American Society of Anesthesiologists (Schaumburg, Illinois), the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation  (Rochester,  Minnesota),  the  Emergency  Care Research Institute (Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania), and the  Society  of American  Gastrointestinal  and  Endoscopic Surgeons  (Los  Angeles,  California). 7-10 These  guidelines, in general, are based upon expert opinion and cases series due to the overall rarity of the event and lack of evidence. Regardless, as a result of these guidelines, many institutions have begun to assign a 'fire risk assessment' score as part of a  surgical 'time-out' 11,12 (fig.  2).  This  checklist  ensures  all members of the team consider what part they play in protecting patients from a fire. Calculating this score increases awareness  of  the  risk  of  fire  but  lacks  actionable  items beyond what should be considered the standard of care in all surgical cases.  T o develop a more robust preventative strategy , our group has sought to define high-risk situations as well as modifiable anesthetic, surgical, and nursing techniques.\nThis review of operating room fires is intended to provide practicing clinicians with the tools and evidence to effectively prevent and/or manage an operating room fire. It is organized around the three components essential for fire creation:  an oxidizer, an ignition source, and a fuel. This creates the 'fire triangle' (fig. 3).   The majority of fires occur 'on the patient' during monitored anesthesia care; thus, special attention will\nbe paid to the oxidizing component of the fire triangle. 4 The complete elimination of fire risk is impossible as these components are key to a successful surgery; however, the risk can be  minimized  by  careful  separation  of  the  components  of the fire triangle. W e will break down each component and examine the modifiable factors and available evidence as well identify high-risk scenarios that should be avoided if possible.",

      "content": "When ignited, oxygen combines with a fuel source to produce heat, gas,  and light.   At sea level,  air is composed of 21% oxygen and is the most common 'oxidizer. ' Nitrous oxide is the other major oxidizer in operating and procedure rooms.  The importance of oxygen content cannot be overemphasized as studies have revealed that nearly all objects can become fuel for a fire once the oxygen content increases to greater than 30%. 13,14\nEmphasis on oxygen delivery is critical not only because of increasing flammability but also because of increased rates of injury when operating close to an oxygen source and/ or  airway. A  review  of  operating  room  fire  claims  found that 85% of fires occurred in the head, neck, or upper chest, and 81% of cases occurred with monitored anesthesia care. 4 These fires are typically attributed to increases in oxygen content at the surgical site.\nThe local oxygen concentration is significantly affected by  anesthetic  care  providing  supplementation via 'open' or 'closed' sources. Open systems include nasal cannula or mask oxygen delivery and will increase surrounding oxygen  content  in  relation  to  oxygen  delivered  (fraction  of inspired oxygen [Fio 2 ]).   When monitored anesthesia care is employed, the onus is on the anesthesiologist to titrate oxygen delivery to the minimal acceptable saturation. 15\nGiven the increased fire risk related to oxygen, the Joint Commission (Oakbrook  T errace, Illinois) and the Emergency Care Research Institute recommend use of air or Fio 2 less than or equal to 30% for open delivery . 16  Per the Emergency",

(Anesthesiology 2019; 130:492-501)\nCare Research Institute, this recommended oxygen concentration has not been verified, but should be used as a marker to  'establish guidelines for minimizing oxygen concentration under surgical drapes. ' These recommendations are echoed by the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation, which suggests the use of endotracheal intubation or laryngeal mask airway in any procedure above the xiphoid or if oxygen supplementation greater than 30% is required. 9\nDetermining the relationship between oxygen supplementation and room oxygen content is not a simple task. Operating rooms have a federal requirement of at least 20 air  exchanges per hour, which creates enough circulation to disperse oxygen delivery by nasal cannula for the entire room. 17 What is more important, however, is the oxygen content at the site of the procedure.  With respect to nasal cannula delivery ,   local  oxygen  concentrations  can  increase  by  more than 5% at low flow rates (less than 4 L/min) and can become disastrous with levels up to 60 to 70% at higher flow rates. 18,19\nFurther  complicating  matters  is  that  measurement  of inhaled gas composition ( i.e. ,   oxygen content) at delivery is not standard on all anesthesia machines. Reducing oxygen  concentration  by  blending  100%  oxygen  with  room air and delivery via a  common gas outlet can be done in some cases, but may also require an add-on gas blender. 16 In addition, there is often a lag between reductions in oxygen delivery  and  exhaled  oxygen  content.  In  a  closed  circuit model, it took up to 5  min to reduce inspired and expired oxygen from 60% to 30%. 20  If one is lacking the capability to  measure  oxygen  content  as  it  is  delivered  and  returns from the patient, the current recommendation is to discontinue 100% oxygen supplementation for at least 60  s and up to 3  min before (and during) energy use. 7\nThe interruption of air exchange by surgical drapes also significantly affects oxygen concentration. For example, the draping for a neurosurgical procedure and use of an oxygen mask with 6 L/min of oxygen resulted in oxygen concentrations of 35 to 50% in the operative field. 21  Redraping so that no 'tent' covered the field resulted in normal oxygen content. A similar study recreating operating room conditions  during  a  facial  surgery  that  resulted  in  a  fire  found that supplemental oxygen increased oxygen concentration under the drapes to over 50%. 22  These findings highlight the dangers of open oxygen sources and surgical draping and have led to the recommendations for an open draping technique whenever surgery is required close to the oxygen source. 23\nClosed  systems  can  maintain  atmospheric  oxygen levels near, or at, normal room air concentration while still providing increased levels of supplemental oxygen to the patient. 18,19  Endotracheal tubes (ETTs) are the most common delivery method; however, laryngeal mask airways  are  also  considered  a  closed  system.  Inflating  the cuff of the ETT can decrease oxygen leakage but is not always feasible. 24 With a closed system, the utilization of elevated oxygen content remains risky as the ETT cuff itself  can  be  damaged  or  even  ignited  by  heat  sources (energy  devices)  when  operating  on  or  near  the  airway. 25   In 'closed' sources, a recent review in otolaryngology procedures identified  inspired  oxygen  delivered was greater than 30% in 97% of surgical fires in general anesthesia cases. 26 Even reinforced, 'laser resistant' ETTs are not recommended to be used with oxygen content greater than 30% because of the risk of fire if damaged or leaking. 27\nUnique methods have been developed to decrease oxygen  concentration  around  the  operative  field  due  to  its massive  impact  on  the  risk  of  fire. A  suction  system  for excess oxygen under drapes significantly reduces ambient oxygen concentrations, and our most recent testing demonstrated that utilization of combined energy/suction devices significantly reduced the incidence of fires. 28,29  'Flooding' the surgical field with carbon dioxide has been shown to prevent fires during tracheostomy in an animal model. 30 A carbon dioxide projecting sleeve has been developed for utilization around the monopolar,  'Bovie' unit and eliminated the fire risk when tested with 100% oxygen. 31  Utilization of these devices may become more common as the most effective technique to minimize fire risk in a cost-effective manner is refined.\nAnother novel solution may be the use of closed-loop oxygen titration  to  adjust  the  delivered  Fio 2 to  the  lowest possible amount. There has been considerable research in closed-loop oxygen delivery in order to reduce oxygen consumption  in  austere  environments,  reduce  hyperoxia, reduce hypoxia, and offer earlier intervention in acute lung injury.  This technology may also be applicable in preventing operating room fires, but implementation remains far in the future. 32,33\nIn  sum:  clinicians  can  reduce  the  risk  of  surgical  fires by maintaining the local oxygen concentration at less than 30%. Even minor elevations in oxygen concentration as a result of supplemental oxygen and/or surgical drapes result in an astronomically increased risk for fire.",

      "title": "ignition Source",
      "content": "Surgical energy is the ignition source in 90% of operating room claims. 6,34  The most common form of surgical energy is monopolar radiofrequency energy, also known as the 'Bovie,' after William T. Bovie, Ph.D., who developed the  first  electrosurgical  generator  in  1926. 35  The  Bovie converts  electromagnetic  energy  into  thermal  energy. 36 Slow heating of tissue  results  in  melting  of  intracellular proteins and the creation of a coagulum. Rapid heating can cause 'boiling' of the cells with vaporization of the contents.  No  matter  the  technique,  it  is  the  heating  of tissue or the energy device itself that serves as the ignition source for the fire.\nNo specific studies have been done to compare the fire risk of common types of surgical energy (monopolar, bipolar,  or ultrasonic); however, clinical experience dictates that monopolar energy is the most susceptible to the creation of an ignition spark. 36 Bipolar energy forces cellular heating only between the jaws of the instrument with minimal space for spark creation; however, bipolar energy has also been reported as a source of fire in oropharyngeal surgery. 37 Ultrasonic energy creates a direct heating effect due to rapid vibration of the tips of the device without the transfer of electromagnetic energy to the tissue but can cause elevation in tissue temperatures to more than 200°C. 36,38\nIt  is  important  to  note  that  monopolar  energy  takes many  forms,  including  the  handheld  'Bovie,'  radiofrequency ablation catheters, and the argon plasma coagulator.  In  particular,  forced  spark  gaps  can  be  easily  created with  monopolar  devices,  especially  the  handheld  Bovie and the argon plasma coagulator device. Education in the appropriate techniques of use, including fire prevention, is available from the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic  Surgeons  through  their  Fundamental  Use  of Surgical Energy program.\nThe second most common ignition source is the 'light amplification  by  stimulated  emission  of  radiation, '  commonly known as the laser. 39   Lasers  are  used  in  cosmetic, eye, and oral surgeries-all areas above the xiphoid that are considered  high-risk. The  high  risk  of  fire  with  lasers  in these  locations  is  known  to  physicians  who  indicated  on a  recent  survey  that  the  most  common  major  complication of endoscopic laser surgery was a fire. 40  Even with an ETT in place, a surgical laser can penetrate an unprotected tube  and  cause  a  fire  in  less  than  2  s  when  100%  Fio 2 is being used. 30,41,42  Protected ETTs are no guarantee against fire, and instead surgeons must be vigilant about avoiding direct contact with the laser no matter the type of ETT. 41,43 In addition, current American Society of Anesthesiologists guidelines recommend instillation of saline and methylene blue within the cuff in order to rapidly demonstrate inadvertent cuff balloon perforation. 7\nOne additional ignition source warrants specific mention due to its increasing use: the fiberoptic light cord.  This cord is utilized during laparoscopic and robotic procedures and, when not in standby mode, can rapidly burn through drapes and cause thermal injury to patients. 44 In the appropriate setting, it is feasible these cords could ignite an operating room fire, and care must be taken to ensure that they are in standby mode when not in use.\nIn  sum:  surgical  and  nursing  vigilance  is  essential  to identify potential ignition sources and is a central part of the fire risk assessment. Avoidance of all energy devices is not viable;  however,  selection  of  low-risk  devices  (ultrasonic devices) and/or adopting techniques that avoid the creation of a spark-gap can decrease the risk of fire.",

While  hair  clipping  does  decrease  the  risk  of  surgical  site  infection  when  compared to preoperative shaving , there is minimal evidence to suggest that hair removal itself decreases  the  risk  of  surgical  site  infection  or  operating room fires. 47,48 As an alternative, the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses recommends the use of a nonflammable gel to isolate hair that is not clipped in order to decrease the risk of fire. 23\nCombustible gas in the gastrointestinal tract has been the fuel source for a fire or explosion in at least 20 reported cases, including during open surgery . 49,50  The presence of methane and hydrogen in the colon is a result of fermentation of nonabsorbable or incompletely absorbed carbohydrates by colonic flora.  Mannitol-based bowel preparations had been associated with  increases  in  combustible  gas  production  and  are  no longer widely used. Mechanical bowel preparation (polyethylene glycol [GoLytely; Braintree Laboratories, USA] and oral sodium sulfate [Suprep; Braintree Laboratories], among others) is now commonly used to remove bowel contents and explosive  gases  preoperatively .   A  non-mannitol-based  prep can be combined with an antibiotic prep to reduce intracolonic bacteria, has demonstrated to decrease wound infection rates,  and should also decrease fire risk. 51,52",

      "title": "Non-Patient-dependent Factors",
      "content": "Factors  independent  of  the  patient  include  the  drapes, sponges, and linens associated with creating a sterile operating field as well as the antiseptic skin prep. Airway devices, including ETT and supraglottic airways, are all composed of  combustible materials. 23  Anesthetic gases used prior to the 1960s (cyclopropane, ethylene chloride, among others)\nwere combustible, but nonflammable agents have been used primarily since the 1970s. 53\nDry  surgical  sponges,  gauze,  and  drapes  can  be  easily ignited. The flammability of these fuels can be reduced when  the  materials  are  moistened. 7 While  not  clinically useful  in  all  surgical  scenarios,  the  use  of  saturated  gauze may still be effective in removing blood and debris from the operative field during procedure in high (fire) risk locations (head and neck, oropharynx, and trachea/bronchus). 54,55 The use of saline-soaked gauze when utilizing an ignition source near the airway is recommended by the American Society of  Anesthesiology  in  the  2012  Practice  Advisory  on  the Prevention and Management of Operating Room Fires. 7\nPaper drapes and gowns are also frequently implicated in surgical fires.  While these items are often rated as 'flame resistant'  and/or  'nonflammable,'  they  can  still  ignite in  normal  operating  conditions. 13 In  fact,  benchtop  testing  revealed  common  surgical  materials  (surgical  gowns, gauze  laparotomy  pads,  among  others)  that  met  nonflammability criteria set by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (Bethesda, Maryland) all become flammable with small elevations in room oxygen content. 56\nAlcohol-based skin preps are frequently blamed for fueling  surgical  fires,  and  multiple  published  reports  confirm this accusation. 57-59  The flammability of alcohol-based surgical  skin  preps  is  acknowledged  by  their  manufacturers, who recommend waiting at least 3  min and up to 1  h after application to allow complete drying with the goal of eliminating fire risk. 60,61 This delay is to allow evaporation of the immediate bactericidal agent (isopropyl alcohol) so that it cannot be ignited by a nearby heat source. It is important to remember that skin preps that include the word 'tincture' contain isopropyl alcohol.\nTo test the efficacy of these recommendations and the flammability of all skin preps, our group recently published our findings utilizing an ex vivo porcine model for testing. 62 Alcohol-based preps (2% chlorhexidine with 70% isopropyl alcohol and 0.7% iodine povacrylex with 74% isopropyl alcohol)  could  be  ignited  in  almost  one  quarter  of  cases immediately after application, and this did not significantly decrease after waiting 3  min for drying time. Allowing the alcohol-based prep to pool created the highest risk scenario, with fires occurring in 38% of cases (table 1). No fires were created with non-alcohol-based preps (table 2).\nCommon fuels in  the  operating  room.  Of  note,  nearly  all  materials,  even  those marked 'nonflammable,' become flammable when the oxygen content is elevated.\nAll  fires  with  the  alcohol-based prep were ignited after the 'drying time' with a 2-s activation of a standard monopolar 'Bovie' pencil. No fires were ignited with a non-alcohol-based prep. Reproduced from Jones et al. 62\nIn light of these findings, the use of a non-alcohol-based prep (2% chlorhexidine or 0.7 to 1% iodine) may seem like  an  attractive  alternative  in  order  to  reduce  fire  risk. Unfortunately,  this  runs  counter  to  recent  2017  recommendation for the  use  of  alcohol-based  antiseptic  agents (for  intraoperative  skin  preparation  to  decrease  superficial and deep surgical site infections) by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, Georgia). 57,63-66 As more data emerge regarding alcohol-based preps, clinicians will need to compare the risk of fire to the risk of surgical infections to appropriately protect their patients from fire and/or infection.\nAirway  devices  themselves  have  been  the  source  of fuel in upper airway fires. A recent review found the ETT\nwas the fuel source in 49% of fires in the operating room during  surgery  on  the  airway. 26 Similarly,  nasal  cannulas  and  supraglottic  airways  are  also  composed  of  polyvinylchloride,  a  combustible  material,  as  defined  by  the American Society of Testing Materials. 23 In high risk situations, particularly laser surgery of the larynx, metal reinforced 'laser-safe' tubes are recommended. Unfortunately, these tubes are not foolproof, and fires were easily started in models with laser-safe tubes when the cuff is damaged or the laser is directed at the tip of the tube (which lacks metal reinforcement). 67\nIn  sum,  clinicians  can  reduce  the  risk  of  surgical  fires by altering or eliminating fuel sources as follows: (1) utilize non-alcohol-based skin preps or, at the very least, (2)\nstrictly  avoid  allowing  alcohol-based  skin  preps  to  pool; (3) utilize moistened surgical gauze when appropriate; (4) utilize a non-mannitol-based mechanical bowel prep with or without concomitant antibiotics when bowel surgery is indicated;  and  (5)  utilize  laser-safe  tubes  in  upper  airway surgery with careful attention to cuff integrity.",

      "title": "Management of a Surgical Fire",
      "content": "A fire in the operating room is a terrifying event, but it can be stopped quickly with early identification and management. In addition to a fire risk assessment and checklist before  surgery,  cognitive  aids  such  as  emergency  manuals have been successfully used during both training and emergencies  to  improve  team  performance  in  times  of duress. 68,69   In  contrast to many emergencies ( e.g. ,   cardiac arrest), immediate action is required when a fire is identified;  thus,  cognitive  aids  may  be  of  benefit  in  training alone in this regard.\nFree  cognitive  aids  are  available  from  the  Anesthesia Patient  Safety  Foundation  and  the  Emergency  Care  Research Institute  for  training,  as  well  as  handouts  and  signage  for rapid  review  in  the  operating  room. 8,70   The  American Society of Anesthesia published a Practice Advisory in 2013 regarding operating room fires that includes an algorithm from basic risk assessment through management of the fire itself. 7 These algorithms distill the key points into a single piece of paper that should be reviewed at least annually by the operating room team in order to adequately prepare for a surgical fire (fig. 4).\nWhen there is suspicion of a fire by any member of the  team,  the  surgery  should  be  stopped  immediately. Rapid identification is key and can be problematic with alcohol-based prep fires as they exhibit a light blue flame that is difficult to visualize alongside blue surgical drapes. Besides the obvious heat and smoke, fires may also be preceded  by  unusual  sounds,  odors,  or  patient  complaints. Once  a  fire  is  identified,  the  following  tasks  should  be performed almost simultaneously by all members of the operating room team 71 :\n1.    Stop the flow of all airway gases and disconnect the breathing circuit.\na.    For airway fires, remove the ETT and pour saline in the airway.\n2.    Remove all burning and burned materials from the patient.\n3.    Extinguish the fire on the burning material.\n4.  Care for the patient.\na.  Restore breathing with room air.\nThe  operating  room  has  many  unique  circumstances that make elimination of the fire triad difficult. 53  Many surgical  drapes  are  water-resistant  and  repel  water  and  must be submerged after their removal to completely extinguish flames. 72 Fires  that  occur  within  a  body  cavity  require dousing  with  saline  or  sterile  water  and  should  not  be\nextinguished with fire extinguishers. 53 Of importance, fire blankets should not be used in the operating room since they can concentrate both heat and oxygen on the patient, potentially worsening the fire. 73\nUse  of  a  fire  extinguisher  is  exceedingly  rare,  but  all operating  suites  are  required  to  maintain  them  for  use. Should  one  be  required,  please  remember  the  'PASS' method of use: P ull the safety pin from the handle; A im at the base of the fire; S queeze slowly to discharge the extinguishing agent; S weep side-to-side, keeping a safe distance from the fire. 74\nSurgical fires also present a unique microcosm of modern  medicine. They  are  rare  events  that  need  a  systemic approach to prevent and study, yet because of their rarity, interventions  are  difficult  to  assess.  New  safety  solutions may have unintended effects. For example, regulations to protect against fire in hospitals in France have been revised five times in the past 8 yr, despite few data on whether these regulations  have  improved  fire  safety  as  opposed  to  simply making the system more unwieldy. 75  The system needs to abandon some professional autonomy, have system-level arbitration  to  optimize  safety  strategies,  and  simplify  the system; however, these barriers need to be addressed in a successive manner. Prevention of operating room fires will also require these barriers to be overcome in order to truly decrease risk for all involved in patient care.",
