      "title": "Introduction",
      "content": "Each year, approximately 1 million patients in the USA are hospitalised with pneumonia. 1,2 Of these individuals, 20-40%  develop  parapneumonic  e/uniFB00usions,  of  whom 5-10%  develop  empyema. 1 There are approximately 80 000 annual cases of pleural infections in the USA and UK combined. 3,4 Despite optimal management, the 1-year mortality from empyema is 10-15%. 5,6\nParapneumonic  e/uniFB00usions  evolve  through  a  spectrum of  three  stages. 2 The  initial  exudative  stage  (stage  1; analogous to simple parapneumonic e/uniFB00usion) is characterised by an increased outpouring of fluid into the pleural  space  mediated  by  capillary  permeability.  If  left untreated,  persistent  inflammation  with  the  associated rise  in  fluid  plasminogen  activator  inhibitor  causes  a decrease in fluid fibrinolytic concentrations. 7 During this second  stage  (stage  2;  fibrinopurulent  stage),  as  the e/uniFB00usion  becomes  infected,  septations  and  adhesions induced by fibrin deposition divide the space into pockets or  locules.  With  the  proliferation  of  fibroblasts  and  the formation  of  a  pleural  peel,  lung  expansion  becomes restricted and can result in a non-expandable lung. It is important  to  initiate  all  medical  treatment  before  this final so-called organising stage (stage 3) ensues. With  the  formation  of  a  fibrous  peel,  the  likelihood  of improvement without surgery is low. The management of both complicated parapneumonic e/uniFB00usions (ie, not overtly purulent fluid, with pH <7Â·2, glucose <40-60 mg/dL, and lactate dehydrogenase >1000 IU/L) and thoracic empyema (ie,  pus in the pleural space or a positive Gram stain or culture of pleural fluid) is largely the same. For simplicity, we refer to both conditions as empyema throughout this Position Paper. 3\nThe treatment of empyema requires prolonged antibiotics and drainage of the pleural cavity. Although\npleural  septations,  loculations,  or  high  fluid  viscosity can  pose  challenges  to  adequate  drainage  in  many patients,  only  around  15%  of  patients  eventually  need surgery,  as  evidenced  from  the  placebo  groups  in  the MIST1 and MIST2 trials. 5,6 The  landmark  MIST2  trial was  a  multicentre,  blinded,  two-by-two  factorial  trial, in which 210 patients were randomly assigned to receive a  combination  of  tissue  plasminogen  activator  (tPA) and deoxyribonuclease (DNase), tPA alone,  DNase alone,  or  placebo.  Combined  use  of  tPA  and  DNase improved fluid drainage (as assessed radiographically), and  decreased  surgical  referral  rates  and  length  of hospital stay. 6\nAlthough understanding of the pathogenesis and microbiology of pleural infections has improved considerably  in  the  past  two  decades,  several  questions remain regarding the optimal management  of this condition.  The  British  Thoracic  Society  last  released  a recommendation on the management of pleural infections in 2010, before the publication of the MIST2 trial. 3 In 2015, a  consensus  statement  by  the  European  Association  for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery suggested that intrapleural fibrinolysis  should  be  reserved  for  patients  who  are unsuitable for surgical intervention and single lung ventilation. 8 In 2017, the American Association for Thoracic Surgery recommended against routine use of fibrinolytics in patients with empyema, yet did not go into details on appropriate  use. 1 It  has  been  almost  a  decade  since  the publication of the MIST2 trial; 6 however, there is still no consensus on routine use, dosing regimens, timing of use, and the overall role (partly driven by cost) of intrapleural fibrinolytics.  A  few  publications  have  assessed  di/uniFB00erent regimens, but overall guidance is missing. This Position Paper  addresses  this  gap  in  knowledge  by  focusing  on important issues relating to the use of intrapleural therapy\nLancet Respir Med 2021; 9: 1050-64\nPublished Online February 2, 2021 https://doi.org/10.1016/ S2213-2600(20)30533-6\n*Contributed equally\nDivision of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA (U Chaddha MBBS) ; Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Donald and Barbara Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra-Northwell, New Hyde Park, NY, USA (A Agrawal MD) ; Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA (Prof D Feller-Kopman MD) ; Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Crouse Health-SUNY Upstate Medical University, Syracuse, NY, USA (V Kaul MD) ; Department of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA, USA (S Shojaee MD) ; Division of Allergy, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA (Prof F Maldonado MD) ; Section of Thoracic Surgery, University of Chicago Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA (Prof M K Ferguson MD) ; Institute of Cancer Sciences and Glasgow Pleural Disease Unit, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, UK (Prof K G Blyth MD) ; The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA (H B Grosu MD) ; Interventional Pulmonology Service, University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust, Plymouth, UK (J P Corcoran BMBCh) ; Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, USA (A Sachdeva MBBS) ; Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK\n(A West MRCP) ; Oxford Centre for Respiratory Medicine, Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust, Oxford, UK (E O Bedawi MBBS MRCP) ; Oxford Respiratory Trials Unit, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK (E O Bedawi, Prof N M Rahman BMBCh) ;\nDepartment of Surgery, Division of Thoracic Surgery and Interventional Pulmonology\n(A Majid MD, S P Gangadharan MD) and Complex Chest Disease Center (E Folch MD) , Beth Israel Massachusetts General Hospital Sherwood Forest Hospitals NHS\nDeaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA; Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care, Apollo Hospitals, Bangalore, India (R M Mehta MD) ; Division of Thoracic Surgery, University of Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada (Prof M Liberman MD) ; Department of Medicine, Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA (Prof M M Wahidi MD) ; Foundation Trust, Sutton-inAshfield, UK (Prof M E Roberts PhD) ; Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, USA (M M DeCamp MD)\nCorrespondence to: Dr Udit Chaddha, Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029, USA drudit@gmail.com\nwith fibrinolytics  and  DNase  in  patients  with  empyema.

The panel included 18 pulmonologists and four thoracic surgeons  from 20 di/uniFB00erent institutions across five countries, all of whom had  experience  in  managing  empyema.  The  document was revised on the basis of comments from all 22 members. The revised document was then shared with all members and subsequently discussed during a conference call, with 64% participation  (14  members).  During  the  conference call, individual suggestions were reviewed and incorporated in  real  time.  The  modified  Delphi  technique,  a  widely accepted method for the development of consensus among experts, was used. 11-13 T o  achieve  consensus,  the  decision was  made  a  priori  to  conduct  up  to  three  rounds  of anonymous  voting  or until  consensus  was  achieved  for each question, whichever came first. The survey, incorporating the questions and revised recommendations, was sent to all panel members. The panel independently and anonymously rated the appropriateness of the recommendations  on  a  5-point  Likert  scale.  Consensus was defined a priori as at least 70% agreement (4 or 5 on the Likert scale), with a minimal response rate of 80%. The results of the survey were tallied and reported to the group. There was 96% survey participation (21 members) and  consensus  was  achieved  on  all  questions  (table  1).\nThroughout this Position Paper, working group recommendations based on strong evidence are denoted by  'we  recommend'.

      "title": "Literature review",
      "content": "The  use  of  intrapleural  fibrinolytics  for  empyema  was first described in 1949. 14 It was not until the late 1980s that there  was  a  resurgence  in  the  use  of  streptokinase  for empyema. 15 Since  then,  several  small  randomised  trials showing conflicting outcomes have been published. 5,6,16-25 A 2019 Cochrane review of randomised trials addressing this topic found that fibrinolytic therapy did not reduce mortality,  compared  with  placebo  (odds  ratio  [Odds ratio (OR)]  1Â·24 [95% CI 0Â·74-2Â·07]). 26 Surgical referral rates and overall treatment  failure  (ie,  a  composite  of  surgical  referral, further  fibrinolytic  therapy,  and  mortality)  were  lower with  fibrinolytic  therapy  (0Â·37  [0Â·21-0Â·68])  than  with placebo (0Â·16 [0Â·05-0Â·58]). However, there was considerable heterogeneity between studies. 26  When only studies  with  low  or  unclear  risk  of  bias  were  analysed, neither outcome was significantly reduced with fibrinolytic therapy. 5,6,17,19,24 This finding is consistent with the results of the largest study to address this questionthe MIST1 trial. 5 In this double-blinded trial of 454  patients,  streptokinase  did  not  lead  to  a  significant reduction in the primary outcome, a composite of death and  surgical  drainage  at  3  months,  compared  with placebo  (31%  in  the  streptokinase  group vs 27%  in  the placebo group; p=0Â·43). There was also no di/uniFB00erence in radiographic outcomes or length of hospital stay. Although the number of adverse events was higher in the streptokinase group than in the placebo group (7% vs 3%; p=0Â·08), an equal number of patients in both groups had haemorrhage from the intervention (3% in each group). In the MIST2 study, tPA monotherapy did not improve radiographic outcomes, length of hospital stay, or surgical referral rates, compared  with placebo. 6 In a small randomised  trial  of  20  patients,  the  group  receiving streptokinase  had  more  treatment  failures  and  longer duration  of  hospitalisation  than  did  the  group  who received surgery upfront. 27\nThere are few head-to-head comparisons of fibrinolytic  agents.  A  subgroup  analysis  from  a  2014\nmeta-analysis showed that only urokinase had a positive e/uniFB00ect  in  reducing  the  need  for  surgical  intervention. 28 Two  randomised  studies  have  compared  fibrinolytic agents;  streptokinase  versus  urokinase  in  one, 16 and alteplase versus urokinase in another. 25 In these studies, there was no di/uniFB00erence  in  the  mortality  rate,  surgical referral rate, or the composite of both of these, or in the need  for  further  fibrinolytic  therapy.  In  the  study comparing alteplase with urokinase, there was a significantly higher number of serious bleeding events  in  patients  who  received  alteplase  (five  [28%] of 18 patients receiving 20 mg alteplase and four [12%] of 33 patients receiving 10 mg alteplase vs none [0%] of\n48 patients in the urokinase  group). 25 In another prospective  study  comparing  tPA  and  DNase  with urokinase, there was no di/uniFB00erence in the need for an additional chest tube or surgery between the groups. 29 tPA and DNase led to more haemothoraces (defined as blood in the drain) than did urokinase (seven [17%] of 41  patients vs none  [0%]  of  52  patients;  p=0Â·002).  No patient  receiving  tPA  and  DNase  had  a  haemo  globin decrease  or  haemodynamic  change  from  the  haemothorax;  however,  it  did  lead  to  fibrinolytic  discontinuation in five (12%) of these patients. A phase 1 trial of a novel fibrinolytic agent, single-chain urokinase (LTI-01), has  shown  safety  and  tolerability of this\nagent. 30 Whether or not future studies of novel fibrinolytics will show greater e/uniFB03cacy than contemporary agents remains to be seen.\nAlthough not a fibrinolytic, data on DNase monotherapy are scarce. The initial report by Tillet and colleagues 14 in 1949 involved the use of streptococcal DNase in addition to  streptokinase.  Light  and  colleagues 31 showed  that DNase  needed  to  be  added  to  fibrinolytic  therapy  to liquefy  empyema  from  rabbits.  Similarly,  studies  in rabbits 32 and a randomised controlled trial 6 have shown the synergistic e/uniFB00ect of combination therapy. Other than the two-by-two factorial MIST2 trial, there are no studies assessing  the  use  of  DNase  monotherapy. 6 In  MIST2, radiological  improve  ment  and  length  of  hospital  stay were similar among the DNase monotherapy group and the placebo group. However, surgical referral rates were higher  with  use  of  DNase  alone  than  with  the  placebo (p=0Â·01). The authors hypothesised that patient deterioration  in  the  DNase  monotherapy  group  might have  been  due  to  systemic  absorption  of  bacterial  or inflammatory components following biofilm disruption mediated by DNase in the pleural space, with ine/uniFB00ective drainage due to undisrupted fibrinous septations. 6",

      "content": "Where fibrinolytics break septations and create a possible lavage e/uniFB00ect through pleural fluid production, 34,35 DNase works synergistically by reducing fluid viscosity by breaking down the extracellular uncoiled DNA from dead leucocytes and bacteria. Another possible mechanism of synergy could be improved antibiotic penetration through breakdown  of  biofilms  incorporated  with  fibrin  and DNA. 36 The concept of how these agents work in synergy and  enable  improved  drainage  of  empyema  collections has  been  proven  in  animal and  human  studies. 6,32 The MIST2 trial showed that combination therapy with tPA and  DNase  resulted  in  enhanced  fluid  drainage  (and consequent  radiological  improvement),  a  reduced  need for surgical interventions (4% with combination therapy vs 16% with placebo; p=0Â·03; representing a 77% lower surgical referral rate), and a shorter hospital stay (median -6Â·7 days compared with placebo; p=0Â·006), without an increase  in  adverse  events. 6 A  limitation  of  the  MIST2 trial, as acknowledged by the authors of the study, is that the primary outcome of radiographic improvement from baseline cannot be assumed to be a true treatment e/uniFB00ect.\nThe  benefits  of  combination  intrapleural  therapy  with tPA and DNase have been subsequently shown in other non-randomised  settings.  A  multinational,  observational study of 107 patients showed the safety and e/uniFB03cacy of this approach. 37 In this study, 99 (92%) of 107 patients who did not respond to standard therapy with anti  biotics and chest tube drainage could be managed with combination therapy without  the  need  for  surgical  intervention.  Subsequent studies,  including  50-100  patients,  have  all  shown  that approximately 90% of patients treated with combination therapy  can  be  managed  without  surgery. 38-41 In  these studies,  radiological  improvement  and  safety  were  also shown.\nPatients  with  malignant  pleural  e/uniFB00usions  managed with an indwelling pleural catheter can develop infections in the pleural space. These patients, with limited survival, are often not surgical candidates. Evidence to support the use  of  tPA  and  DNase  in  patients  with  an  indwelling pleural  catheter  comes  from  only  six  individuals  in  a retrospective review of 50 patients. 42",

However, there has been no major di/uniFB00erence  reported  in  surgical  referral  rates,  length  of hospital stay, inflammatory marker change, or radiological outcomes. Most studies exploring tPA have used  10  mg,  a  dose  empirically  selected  in  the  MIST trials. In most studies, including the landmark MIST2 trial 6 and the study by Piccolo and colleagues, 37 in which intrapleural  therapy  was  administered  as  subsequent therapy in 90 (84%) of 107 patients, tPA and DNase were administered  twice  daily.  Mehta  and  colleagues 38 used once daily dosing of tPA and DNase and were able to avoid surgical intervention in 51 (93%) of 55 patients. AlemÃ¡n  and  colleagues 25 started  with  a  daily  dose  of\n20 mg tPA alone, but switched mid-protocol to 10 mg after encountering serious bleeding events in five (28%) of 18 patients. In another study, in which tPA alone was used  as  a  25  mg  daily  instillation,  two  patients  had bleeding events; however, this and other adverse events were  not  significantly  di/uniFB00erent  compared  with  the placebo  group. 24 Popowicz  and  colleagues 41 tried  an initial  dose  of  5  mg  tPA,  allowing  dose  escalation  to 10 mg, at the discretion of the treating physician. After an  average  of  3Â·3  doses,  seven  (12%)  of  61  patients required  dose  escalation.  There  was  no  di/uniFB00erence  in length of hospital stay in individuals who required dose escalation.  Overall,  57  (93%)  of  61  patients  avoided surgery and were dis  charged alive (at 1 month). Three patients (5%) had bleeding events requiring blood transfusions.\nStudies investigating urokinase used a dose of 100  000 IU once daily, 16,18,19,25 except for one that used 250  000 IU twice daily. 29 The studies investigating streptokinase mainly used 250 000  IU  daily. 16,17,20,21 In  the  MIST1  trial,  250  000  IU  of streptokinase was administered every 12 h, 5 whereas it was dosed as 2Â·5 million  IU daily in another study. 22 Medications are mixed in 20-100 mL of normal saline for administration.

This type of administration might have partly accounted for the  71% compliance with trial medications reported in this study. 6 A single-centre, retrospective cohort study of 73 patients first showed that concurrent dosing was safe and e/uniFB00ective. 39 Surgery was avoided in 66 patients (90%). Bleeding requiring transfusion occurred in four patients (5%) and pain requiring analgesia dose escalation occurred  in  11  patients  (15%).

Ultrasound can identify smaller fluid pockets with greater sensitivity than chest x-ray and can visualise septations better than CT. 52 The absence of a clinically significant response after 24-48 h should not justify ongoing dosing to complete a pre-decided  treatment  course.  Similarly,  patient  tolerability  before each successive dose must be factored in.

Coincidental  stroke,  major  haemorrhage  or  trauma,  or major  surgery  in  the  previous  5  days  were  exclusion criteria  for  patients  in  the  MIST2  trial. 6 No  randomised trials have been done to specifically address whether or not administration of intrapleural fibrinolytics in patients on systemic anticoagulation increases bleeding risk.\nAlthough  systemic  bleeding  is  rarely  reported  in  the literature, intrapleural bleeding can be seen in 0-5% of patients with empyema treated with intrapleural fibrinolytics. 6,37,39,46 In  the  MIST2  trial,  three  (6%)  of 52 patients had adverse events related to bleeding in the tPA-DNase group, with two cases of intrapleural bleeding and one case of haemoptysis. 6 In a retrospective study  of  66  patients,  all  four  patients  who  had  major pleural bleeding were noted to be in the therapeutic anticoagulation group (N=12). 54 None of the 38 patients on prophylactic anticoagulation had bleeding. In a retrospective study of 30 patients with malignant pleural e/uniFB00usion  who  received  intrapleural  fibrinolytic  therapy and were on concurrent anticoagulation, two (6%) experienced pleural bleeds requiring transfusion. 55\nHowever, it is important to note that the median number of doses was one, the most frequent dose was 25 mg of tPA, and that only one patient received six doses of tPA. Of the four patients (5%) who had bleeding in a study by Majid and colleagues, 39 one  individual  had  a  history  of liver  cirrhosis,  and  another  had  atrial  fibrillation  being treated  with  anticoagulation.  Table  2  summarises  the major studies reporting bleeding events with intrapleural fibrinolytic administration.\nPopowicz and colleagues 41  acknowledged the bleeding risk with tPA and sought to evaluate the safety of a lower dose (ie, 5 mg). However, bleeding rates were similar to those reported for 5 mg in previous publications (4Â·9%). There  is  plausible  evidence  from  two  trials  to  suggest that bleeding rates with urokinase are lower than those with  tPA.  In  a  randomised  trial,  five  (28%)  of  the 18 patients who received 20 mg alteplase and four (12%) of  the  33  patients  who  received  10  mg  alteplase  had bleeding. 25 In  another study, tPA led to haemothoraces (defined  as  blood  in  the  drain)  in  seven  (17%)  of 41  patients. 29 None  of  the  patients  receiving  tPA  and DNase  had  a  haemoglobin  drop  or  haemodynamic change  from  the  haemothorax;  however,  five  (12%)  of these patients had fibrinolytic discontinuation. In both of these studies, no patient on urokinase had a bleeding event.",

Although  there  are  no  data  to  suggest increased  bleeding  risk in patients on  antiplatelet agents such as clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor, it is reasonable to exercise caution until further evidence is available. Specific cuto/uniFB00s of prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastic time, and platelet counts, which should contraindicate intrapleural administration  of  fibrinolytics,  cannot  be  established from existing literature. However, despite the fact that intrapleural  bleeding  events  might  require  surgery  or blood  transfusion,  they  rarely  lead  to  haemodynamic changes or death. Although there appears to be a dosedependent risk  of  bleeding,  doses  of  less  than  10  mg tPA  have  not  been  shown  to  be  safer  than  doses  of 10 mg.\nGiven the available evidence, we recommend exercising caution when considering the use of intrapleural fibrinolytics in patients who are at risk of bleeding. When possible, the systemic coagulopathy should be corrected, or the anticoagulant should be held. If this is not feasible, starting with low doses (and escalating if need be) with close monitoring of pleural fluid output can be considered in  patients  who  are  not  surgical  candidates,  after  a multidisciplinary risk-benefit discussion.

The other trial included 70 patients and compared VATS debride  ment with tube thoracostomy (without the use of intrapleural fibrinolytic or DNase therapy). 56 This study noted a shorter length of stay  (8Â·3  days vs 12Â·8  days)  and  less  need  for  open surgery (17% vs 37%; p<0Â·05) in the VATS group than in the  tube  thoracostomy  group.  The  need  for  surgical intervention in the tube thoracostomy group was higher (37%) than that reported in the placebo groups of MIST1 and MIST2 trials (14-16%). 5,6 The study was unblinded, did not have prespecified criteria for surgical intervention in  the  tube  thoracostomy  group,  and  did  not  describe use  of  intrapleural  fibrinolytic  or  DNase  therapy.  A retrospective study assessing 78 patients, with 54 patients in the VATS group and 24 patients in the streptokinase group, noted no di/uniFB00erence in the need for open surgery. 57 However,  patients  in  the  VATS  group  had  a  shorter length  of  stay  than  those  in  the  streptokinase  group. Another study, in which  28 patients with stage 1 empyema  were  managed  with  tube  thoracostomy  and 38 patients with stage 1 and 2 empyema were managed with VATS, noted reduced morbidity and length of stay in  the  VATS  group. 58 However,  the  patients  were  not randomly assigned, and a fibrinolytic agent was used in only  two  (7%)  of  28  patients  in  the  tube  thoracostomy group. A few centres with expertise use medical thoracoscopy as an alternative to VATS in patients with stage  2  empyema.  However,  there  are  no  studies  that have compared medical thoracoscopy with VATS in this population. A single-centre study of 32 patients comparing  medical  thoracoscopy  with  intrapleural  tPA and DNase has established the safety of this procedure. 59",

      "content": "The  objective  of  surgery  in  empyema  is  to  evacuate infected material and to re-expand the lung. The American Association for Thoracic Surgery recommends that VATS should be the first-line approach in all patients with stage 2 acute empyema, 1 especially  in  patients  under  the  care  of  a  dedicated thoracic surgeon. However, surgery has been associated with up to a 30% complication rate and approximately 4%  mortality  rate. 60-63 Besides,  some  series  assessing VATS have tended to operate on healthier patients, as evidenced by the younger age and fewer comorbidities of these patients compared with those with empyema. 64,65 The conversion rate from VATS to open decortication is 0Â·0-3Â·5%  in  early-stage  empyema  and  7Â·1-46Â·0%  in late-stage empyema. 63 Delays in referral are associated with higher conversion rates to open thoracotomy  (<60%). 60-62 The  largest  series  reported  a conversion  rate  to  open  decortication  of  11Â·4%. 66 It should also be considered that VATS can be done with only one or two ports, making the incremental invasiveness of a VATS  approach compared with medical therapy much smaller than that of thoracotomy compared  with  medical  therapy.  A  detailed  review  of VATS versus open thoracotomy is beyond the scope of this Position Paper. Although there is one small study comparing medical thoracoscopy with tPA and DNase, 59 routine use of this procedure in patients with empyema requires large, multicentre, randomised controlled, prospective validation.\nThere  is  only  one  randomised  trial  addressing  the question of surgery versus intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy first in patients  with  empyema. 27 Although studies  show  a  shorter  hospital  stay  with  surgery  than with fibrinolytics, an improvement in any other clinical outcome cannot be inferred from the available data. No studies in adults have compared VATS with a combination therapy of a fibrinolytic agent and DNase. Although the identification of a pleural rind (ie, stage 3 empyema) is an uncontroversial indication for surgery, routine  decortication in patients  with  pure  stage  2 empyema  appears  to  be  unnecessary.  Patients  who receive combination intrapleural therapy with a fibrinolytic and DNase need surgical interventions in up to  10%  of  cases. 5,6,37-41 Therefore,  a  routine  surgery-first approach will lead to procedures in many more patients than would need it. Even the placebo group in the MIST1 and MIST2 trials needed surgical referral in only 15% of cases. 5,6 However, in clinical practice, establishing a firm dichotomy between stage 2 and 3 is challenging. 1 In  patients  who  are  not  improving  or  worsening  (ie, medical treatment failure), with uncontrolled sepsis, any risk of surgery is outweighed by the potential benefit that might be attained.\nDespite years of experience with either approach, this question remains an extensively debated area and we still do  not  know  what  the  optimal  initial  treatment  for\nempyema is. Ongoing trials (eg, NCT03584113, NCT03583931, NCT02165891, and ISRCTN18192121) will try to better answer this question. Long-term outcomes and patient quality of life after either intervention has not been adequately studied.",

Although various studies have evaluated the e/uniFB00ect of intrapleural fibrinolytic  and  DNase  therapy  on  length  of  hospital stay and the need for surgical referral, there have been no studies evaluating their cost-e/uniFB00ectiveness compared with  other  management  modalities. 5,6,27,38-41,56-58 Median hospital  stay  in  patients  with  empyema  who  receive combined intrapleural therapy is approximately 12  days,  and  the  cost  per  patient  is  estimated  to  be â¬4223. 6,70 Across studies, the mean post-operative length  of  hospital stay  for  patients  undergoing  VATS for stage 2 or 3 empyema ranges from 5 to 17 days. 8,61,66,71-86 An economic evaluation of the MIST2 trial showed that combined tPA and DNase was more cost-e/uniFB00ective than were single agents or placebo. 70 These results are not necessarily  generalisable  to  centres  across  di/uniFB00erent geographical  locations  or  with  varying  expertise  and availability. Additionally, the MIST2  trial was  not designed  to  detect  a  di/uniFB00erence  in  health-care  costs between groups, and it did not assess patient quality of life via questionnaires.
