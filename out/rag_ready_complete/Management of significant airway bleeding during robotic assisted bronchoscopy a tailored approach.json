      "content": "A 71-year-old woman and former smoker (6 pack/year history) with a remote medical history of breast cancer was referred for multiple lung nodules incidentally found during a workup for perforated left breast prosthesis. She had no pulmonary symptoms. A chest CT scan showed a 1-cm elongated nodular opacity along the anterior left upper lobe (LUL) bronchus and adjacent to a large blood vessel (3.8 mm) (Fig. 1). A robotic assisted bronchoscopic biopsy of the LUL lesion was recommended, and the procedure was performed by an expert bronchoscopist with specialized interventional pulmonology training. The RAB was performed under general anesthesia, and paralytics were used. The airway was accessed through a size 8 standard endotracheal tube (ET). The endobronchial navigation was performed after alveolar recruitment maneuver was performed and continued with a PEEP of 10 for the rest of the procedure. These maneuvers were performed with the intention to split open small subsegmental airways and facilitate the advancement of the scope beyond the 5th-6th generation without air insufflation.\nThe  target  lesion  was  reached  utilizing  the  Fiber  Optic  RealShape technology for endoluminal navigation. Once the virtual target  region  was  reached,  the  3.5-mm-outer  diameter  catheter with a 2.0-mm working was locked in position, and utilizing a radial ultrasound probe, the lesion was confirmed by identifying a peribronchiolar lesion. The needle-pass sampling was aided with\nlive fluoroscopy. Upon collecting tissue samples with a 21-G needle,  bleeding  was  noted  traveling  proximally  along  the  robotic catheter and on live fluoroscopic images (Fig. 2). Suction was applied to the proximal end of the robotic catheter. Simultaneously, a flexible bronchoscope (4 mm OD), with a 2.0-mm working channel, was inserted into the airways, parallel to the robotic scope, to help control the bleeding. The flexible bronchoscope was inserted through  the  nose,  traversing  the  vocal  cords  parallel  to  the  ET (Fig. 3a). The ET cuff was then partially deflated, and the bronchoscope was advanced into the distal trachea and distal left main stem bronchus  (Fig.  3b-d).  Bleeding  was  noted  emanating  from  the LUL surrounding the wedged robotic bronchoscope (Fig. 2, 3g). Ice saline and epinephrine were instilled into the bronchial segment where the robotic scope was located. After bleeding ceased and under direct visualization with the flexible bronchoscope, the\nFig. 1. Chest computed tomography showing  the  LUL  nodule  (green  arrow).  LUL, left upper lobe.\nFig. 2.

Complete  airway clearance was then performed. The robotic scope was reinserted to continue the procedure (Fig. 3i). Finally, once RAB was concluded, systematic mediastinal staging with Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) was done. No pneumothorax, worsening hypoxemia, or other complications occurred. The patient was discharged home. Final pathology report revealed nonmalignant  disease.  A  follow-up  chest  CT  scan  will  be  performed in 3 months.",

      "title": "Discussion/Conclusion",
      "content": "Bleeding occurring after a transbronchial lung biopsy using flexible bronchoscopy has standard definitions and accepted management strategies [3]. However, the experience with bleeding during RAB is limited. SAB during RAB is defined as one that requires the withdrawal of the robotic bronchoscope, and insertion of a flexible bronchoscope to manage the bleeding [4]. It is reported to complicate 2.4% of RABs [2, 4]. Its current treatment includes tamponade\nand containment of the localized bleeding with distal wedging of the robotic bronchoscope [2]. The treatment modalities for SAB are limited, and this is in part due to the tradeoff between the stability and reach needed for peripheral bronchoscopy  against  the  delayed  reaction  capacity  and small channel allowing for suboptimal suction. Fortunately, this complication appears to be rare; however, it remains a constant threat to patients, and a clear and effective treatment algorithm is required. If such an episode is encountered in the future, it is the authors' recommendation to implement our proposed management strategy with combined,  simultaneous  flexible  and  robotic  bronchoscopy (Fig. 2) as a next immediate step (Table 1).",
