      "content": "Self-reported global quality of life was measured using the SF-6D,  9  which provides a means to estimate a preference-based single-index measure for health using general population data. The SF-6D generates a measure of utility ranging from 0 to 1 utiles. Integrating utilities over time allows for calculation of qualityadjusted life years (QALYs). In the present analysis, we express quality-adjusted survival in quality-adjusted life days (QALDs) because of the short survival times.\nDyspnea was measured with the Borg score, and performance status was measured with the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score. SF-6D, Borg, and ECOG data were collected at each visit. Complications were documented by mid-level providers  using  standardized  defi  nitions.  All  IPC  removals  were classifi  ed as being elective either due to decreased drainage or due to complication.\ninstru  ments. 5-7   No  study  has  reported  on  qualityadjusted survival.\nOutcome defi  nitions, such as that for pleurodesis, have varied among studies. 5  For example, most studies used the term 'pleurodesis' to describe enduring pleural symphysis, defi  ned radiographically as the absence of pleural fl  uid at 4 to 8 weeks, which facilitated subsequent IPC removal. However, absence of fl  uid recurrence at 4 weeks does not necessarily imply that an effusion will not return subsequently. Unfortunately, long-term data on incidence rates of fl  uid recurrence after IPC removal are lacking, and the duration of follow-up after IPC removal varied widely among studies or was not reported.\nAnother aspect to consider is the type of clinically relevant outcomes. As clinical trials move more toward patient-centered outcomes, measuring the success of interventions for MPE in terms of the need for repeat pleural interventions while maintaining improvements in dyspnea is recommended.  8\nA multidimensional, patient-centered approach to defi  ning and measuring outcomes of MPE treatments is needed. Because these treatments are essentially palliative, any construct that measures MPE treatment success should include a validated measure of qualityadjusted survival. When operationalizing this construct, it is important that outcomes be assessed with validated instruments and that an appropriate timeto-event  methodology be used for analysis rather than incidence proportions taken at arbitrary time points.\nThe goal of this study was to prospectively describe patient-centered outcomes and their associated risk factors for patients with MPE undergoing IPC placement. The primary outcome was quality-adjusted survival. Secondary outcomes were dyspnea, complications, and time to repeat pleural interventions.\nManuscript received August 14, 2013; revision accepted December 28, 2013; originally published Online First January 30, 2014.

Although dyspnea improved signifi  cantly, median quality-adjusted survival was only 95 QALDs, and there were only modest improvements in utility, with  the  greatest  improvements  being  observed  in patients who were more short of breath at baseline\nSee   Table 1 for expansion of abbreviations.\na   Clinical diagnosis: recurrent exudative nonchylous effusions with proven metastatic disease elsewhere.\nIPC 5 indwelling pleural catheter. See   Table 1 legend for expansion of other abbreviations.\nmost studies reporting QALYs use modeling. A systematic review in 2006 identifi  ed only 70 studies that reported QALYs based on pretreatment and posttreatment measurements, and none of these involved MPE.  15  As a result, insuffi  cient information exists to compare the effi  cacy of various interventions in terms of quality-adjusted survival. Knowledge of baseline QALY distributions is also important in terms of clinical study design because the various interventions may affect mortality and quality of life differently. 16   The present fi  ndings are consistent with those in the literature, which demonstrated that for non-small cell lung cancer, utilities  for  various  health  states  for  cancerrelated outcomes range from approximately 0.33 (end of life) to 0.70 (responding to therapy), with progressive disease being approximately 0.47 utiles. 17\nWe observed that utility did not improve much following IPC placement, whereas dyspnea did improve, suggesting that many determinants affect quality of life in patients with MPEs. Although dyspnea certainly is one of these, other factors related to the underlying malignancy are also pivotal. This is consistent with the present fi  nding that the two factors associated with greater improvements in utility were more severe baseline dyspnea and treatment with chemotherapy or radiation following IPC placement.\nThe second domain we focused on was time to recurrent MPE requiring repeat intervention. Previous systematic reviews have focused on pleurodesis, reporting an overall incidence proportion of 46%. 5  Of the 19 studies included, only 10 reported on catheter duration and only 12 on pleurodesis. 5  In all studies, the investigators reported pleurodesis as something achieved at some arbitrary time point, and this was defi  ned radiographically. However, being fl  uid free does not guarantee that fl  uid will not recur at some future time. Similarly, defi  ning  successful  treatment  of  MPE  by  radiographic  criteria  at  one  time  point  is  problematic because some patients may still have IPCs in place and yet may truly have achieved pleurodesis. From a patient-centered perspective, so long as there is no\nmalfunctions, recurrence was more frequent. In a competing risk model, the 1-year cumulative incidence of complications serious enough to warrant IPC removal was 7.3%.\nTo our knowledge, this study is the fi  rst to report quality-adjusted survival following IPC placement. Although other studies have reported on quality of life, the only study to use a validated instrument to report on global health status was the TIME2, but quality-adjusted survival was not reported. 3  QALYs have been recognized as the most important indicator of health-care intervention effectiveness, which is refl  ected by the position statements and guidelines of the National Institute of Clinical Excellence, 11  the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality, and the US Public Health Service. 12-14  QALYs are particularly relevant for treatment of MPE because all interventions are currently palliative in nature. However,\nSee   Table 3 legend for expansion of abbreviation.\na   Patients  could  have  more  than  one  complication;  total  number  of patients was 266.\nWith this approach, we were able to describe and quantify  the  incidence  of  recurrent  MPEs  requiring repeat interventions using survival analysis. Overall, 7.8% of patients required a repeat intervention, which is similar to the overall 7.7% incidence proportion reported in a systematic review. 5   Patients whose IPCs were removed due to decreased drainage required a repeat pleural intervention far less frequently than those whose IPC was removed due to complications. Clinicians should be aware of the higher likelihood of recurrence following IPC removal due to  complications  and  should  closely  follow  these patients for recurrence. If there are no complications, IPCs can be removed electively once drainage decreases. We used a standardized algorithm for IPC management, but it is possible that if we had left the  IPCs  in  longer  after  drainage  decreased  that recurrence following elective removal would have been less frequent. In terms of future research, using standardized algorithms is important because they\nsymptomatic recurrence of MPE, it matters little whether there was pleurodesis or an IPC was in place. From a methodology standpoint, this arbitrary time point is also problematic because patients who die before it cannot be counted in either group.\nThus, rather than measuring the occurrence of pleurodesis radiographically at one moment in time and arbitrarily defi  ning this as success, it is more effective to measure time to failure. In this case, failure is defi  ned as the time to symptomatic MPE recurrence requiring repeat pleural interventions. By operationalizing the constructs in this manner, we can use survival analysis methods to gain insights into clinically relevant outcomes, eliminating all the methodology problems described previously. This is not possible if we defi  ne success as an incidence proportion measured at any one moment in time radiographically. The present study adds to the existing body of evidence in this area by more systematically defi  ning the outcome of recurrent MPE in a clinically meaningful way. 8\nSee   Table 1 and 3 legends for expansion of abbreviations.\na   Clinical diagnosis: recurrent exudative nonchylous effusions with proven metastatic disease elsewhere.\nadditional insights that incidence proportions cannot. 5,18 By examining the time-to-event curves (  Figs 5, 7  ), we see that most of the risk of complications occurs early, within 1 month of IPC placement. When physicians have to decide whether to remove a catheter, they are making a decision based on a contingent probability, not on the baseline incidence proportion. For example, if a patient has had an IPC in place for 3 months and now has decreased drainage, the physician must consider the risk of complications when deciding whether to remove the IPC. But the risk of complications at that time point is not the same as the incidence proportion of infections at baseline (ie, 5%) because the patient has already passed through the period of highest risk, which is the fi  rst 1 to 2 months. This is important because the decision to  remove  an  IPC  involves  a  contingent  probability that is far lower than the baseline incidence proportion of 5%. If physicians incorrectly use the baseline incidence proportion to inform their decisions, they are more likely to prematurely remove IPCs because of the perceived risk of infection. Instead, they should use these data to estimate the hazard function and recognize that the marginal risk of leaving the IPC in  longer  is  actually  much  lower  than  5%.  Thus, studying IPC management algorithms that allow IPCs to remain in longer once drainage is decreased, provided that the IPC has been in place for ≥ 2 months, are warranted because the marginal risk of complications is low. Conversely, if drainage decreases early when the IPC has been in place for only a short while, the marginal risk of complications is still high such\nallow us to compare various IPC management strategies.\nThe fi  nal domain we evaluated was complications. Each physician must balance competing concerns when managing IPCs. On the one hand, removing an IPC too early may lead to recurrent MPE, requiring a second intervention. On the other hand, leaving an IPC in longer than necessary may lead to infectious complications. We capture the two sides of this coin in   Figures 5 and 6  . The incidence proportion of wound site infections (4%) and empyema (1%) was similar to that previously reported. 5\nIn this study, we analyzed the risk of complications using survival analysis methods, which provide\nSee   Table 1 and 3 legends for expansion abbreviations.\na   Clinical diagnosis: recurrent exudative nonchylous effusions with proven metastatic disease elsewhere.\nb  Firth correction was applied when estimating the hazard ratio and the profi  le-likelihood confi  dence limits for the hazard ratios were provided. c   Other reasons for removal were defi  ned as IPC malfunctions that were not true complications but did prevent the tube from functioning. For example, an IPC that was clogged and could not drain would have been defi  ned as other.\nin which the management algorithm is very different. Additionally, we could not empirically measure the cost of care for these patients because the patients received care from multiple providers using multiple payers in multiple sites. As such, collection of total costs would have required access to different fee schedules for many providers outside of our system. Finally, although this is the largest prospective study of IPCs reported, 5 it  is  a  single-center  trial.  Future  studies  of  qualityadjusted survival in this population and the trade-offs involved ideally should involve multiple centers.\nIn conclusion, this study is the fi  rst, to our knowledge, to prospectively measure quality-adjusted survival following IPC placement for MPEs. We found that IPCs were associated with large improvements in dyspnea but relatively modest improvements in utility. Patients who had more dyspnea at baseline and who were able to receive treatment after IPC placement had the greatest improvement in utility. Consistent with the existing literature, complications were infrequent, and recurrent MPE requiring repeat intervention was rare when a standard management algorithm was followed. Repeat interventions were more common when the IPC had to be removed early due to complications or malfunction. Careful analysis of timeto-event data shows that the hazard of complications is highest in the fi  rst month following IPC placement. As such, the marginal benefi  t of leaving IPCs in longer to prevent recurrence may be warranted in select patients, depending on how long the IPC has been in place and how much drainage there is. In the broader context, our hope is that this study provides a template for future studies of treatments for MPE by helping to standardize outcomes, defi  nitions, and methods of analysis. The focus should be on using patient-centered outcomes and the proper use of timeto-event analysis rather than radiographic outcomes and incidence proportions.",

We used a defi  nition of MPE similar to that used in other studies, 3  but this defi  nition allows inclusion of patients who do not have pathologic proof of MPE. Some of these patients might have paramalignant effusions due to lymphatic obstruction. However, we did not fi  nd any signifi  cant difference in outcomes between pathologically proven and clinically diagnosed MPEs, and there was no difference in types of underlying cancer. This fi  nding  is  not  surprising  because  all  the  patients with a clinical diagnosis of MPE had other distant metastatic disease present. The defi  nition used provides some distinct advantages in terms of clinical applicability. Specifi  cally, thoracoscopy is not always feasible (eg, a patient with breast cancer with proven bone metastasis and a recurrent exudative nonchylous effusion with negative cytology and limited performance status). Pursuing a thoracoscopy for a tissue diagnosis in the palliative setting for patients with a low performance status when there is already known metastatic disease often is not warranted. Yet, physicians need data on outcomes for these diffi  cult-tomanage patients. As such, the generalizability of the fi  ndings is better because this study provides physicians with patient outcome data that are most relevant to clinical practice  . In addition, if we had required pathologic proof, it would have created bias because patients with negative initial cytology would only be enrolled if they were deemed fi  t enough for pleuroscopy, whereas those with poor performance status would not be enrolled. This selection bias would lead to a false-positive association between improved QALDs and thoracoscopy and negative initial cytology and would similarly result in a falsely high overall estimate of QALDs in the population overall because those with negative cytology and low performance status would be excluded. The results of such a study would be internally valid but would not necessarily be generalizable to clinical practice. For similar reasons, because many patients in this study were not candidates for thoracoscopy due to poor performance status and comorbidities, the outcomes of patients in this study cannot necessarily be compared with the outcomes of patients undergoing thoracoscopy with talc pleurodesis.\nAnother limitation is the IPC management algorithm. Because the same algorithm was used for all patients, the outcomes observed are linked to this algorithm, presenting both an advantage and a disadvantage. It allows us to design future comparative effectiveness studies of various management algorithms and provides a baseline for future sample size calculations, but the results may not be generalizable to other populations\n4  .
