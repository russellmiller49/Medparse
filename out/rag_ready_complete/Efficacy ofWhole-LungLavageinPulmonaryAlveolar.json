      "content": "Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare lung disease that was first described by Rosen in 1958   [1]  . PAP is characterized by the accumulation of proteins and lipids of the surfactant in the alveolar duct, which are stained positively  by  periodic  acid-Schiff,  resulting  in  impairment of gas exchange   [1-3]  . Patients commonly present with cough and dyspnea   [1]  . The diagnosis is based on the typical  findings  of  the  'crazy-paving'  pattern  on  chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and the 'milky'  fluid  of  bronchoalveolar  lavage  (BAL)    [4,  5]  . Transbronchial,  transthoracic  or  surgical  biopsy  confirms the presence of proteins and lipids stained by periodic acid-Schiff   [6]  . Three main categories of PAP have been defined depending on the etiology: autoimmune (or primary, or idiopathic), secondary and genetic   [3]  . Adult forms  are  mostly  autoimmune,  with  anti-granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) antibodies, and/or secondary to toxic inhalation or hematological disorders, without anti-GM-CSF antibodies   [3]  .\nIn recent years, novel therapies have emerged, such as inhaled  GM-CSF    [7]  ,  plasmapheresis    [8]  and  rituximab [9]  , with the aim to be efficacious in this patient population. Yet, these treatments are costly and have not been fully evaluated in a prospective way. The classic treatment of PAP is whole-lung lavage (WLL)   [10]  , which was first described in 1963   [11]  . WLL is performed with at least 10 L per lung of normal saline, under general anesthesia and selective ventilation   [12]  . The technique is very demanding in both its application and post-procedural patient management, and therefore, it is only applied in experienced centers.  Although  widely  considered  as  the  standard  of care, the WLL procedure, its specific indications and the outcome criteria have not been standardized among centers, and there is still a significant variability in the technique between centers. As a consequence, few studies exist reporting results from patients undergoing WLL. Thus, the aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy and complications of classic treatment of WLL in a cohort of patients with PAP  from  experienced  centers of  the  Groupe d'Endoscopie Thoracique de Langue Française (GELF French-Speaking Thoracic Endoscopy Group).",

The survey was approved by all local internal re-\nview  boards.  Patients'  inclusion  criteria  were  confirmation  of PAP and therapeutic lung lavage. There were no exclusion criteria at this point. Criteria for WLL efficacy measurement to determine the patients' outcomes, related to the procedure only, were (1) 'excellent' if the patient had a complete symptom relief and normal radiological and pulmonary function test (PFT) features; (2) 'improved' if clinical, radiological and PFT improvement  occurred;  (3)  'stable'  if  there  was  no  change  and  (4) 'worse' if the patient was worse or in case of a serious complication or death.\nAlso, physicians who included patients in the study were asked to globally evaluate the efficacy of the procedure by answering the following questions:\n1 Was the WLL a routine procedure for them?\n2 Do they consider WLL the first treatment approach in PAP?\n3 Do they consider WLL efficient?\n4 Do they consider WLL superior to other treatments?\n5 Are they willing to abandon WLL for the benefit of other treatments?\nPossible answers were (1) 'yes,' (2) 'no,' (3) 'don't know - need further evaluation' or (4) 'other - please specify.'\nValues are n (%) unless otherwise indicated.

      "content": "Patients' characteristics and PAP features are shown in Table 1  . The median age was 44 years (range 13-77) with a male predominance (69.7%). Only 5 patients (16.1%) underwent a surgical biopsy for PAP diagnosis when BAL and transbronchial biopsy were not sufficient to draw any conclusions (  Fig. 2  ). The majority of patients (81.1%) had primary PAP. Patients' major symptom at presentation was dyspnea (29-90.8%), associated with respiratory in-\nsufficiency (  Table  1  )  and  motivating  WLL.  Before  performing WLL, 23 (71.9%) patients were hypoxic at rest and 5 (15.2%) were first treated by GM-CSF, which led to WLL in case of treatment failure.\nRegarding the procedure, the median period between diagnosis of PAP and WLL was 7 months (range 0-60). All patients with general anesthesia ( n = 32, 95%) had a selective  intubation,  but  only  12  (36.4%)  had  thoracic percussion. Only 4 (12.1%) patients had both lungs treated in the same setting. In only 6 (18.2%) patients who underwent WLL a flexible bronchoscope was used, and among these 6 patients only 1 (a female child) had local anesthesia (  Table 2  ). The duration of the procedure itself was 150 min (range 35-270), and the duration of anesthesia was 197.5 min (range 90-300) (  Table 2  ). The volume of saline water used was variable ranging from 1 to 40 L (  Table 2  ;   Fig. 3  ). After the procedure (  Table 2  ), 14 (42.4%) patients  returned  to  a  medical  ward  directly  and  19 (57.6%) to an intensive care unit with a median stay of 2 days (range 0.5-28).\nSeventeen (51.5%) patients had a single WLL considered as enough to treat PAP. A second lavage was done in 13 patients, and multiple lavages were done in 3 patients (  Table 3  ). The efficacy of WLL (  Table 3  ) was rated as 'ex-\nColor version available online\ncellent' in 6 (18.2%) patients, as 'improved' in 11 (33.3%), as 'stable' in 7 (21.2%) and as 'worse' in 9 (27.3%).\nProcedure  complications  (  Table  3  )  occurred  in  11 (33.3%) patients. The most frequent complication was a\ndrop in oxygen saturation in 5 (12.1%) patients. Two patients died after WLL: a 70-year-old man who had been diagnosed with a secondary PAP due to a myelodysplastic syndrome and a 63-year-old female with severe respiratory insufficiency in whom no improvement was noted after WLL and who died 4 weeks later.\nAfter the procedure, we noted a significant overall improvement in PaO  2 of 6.375 mm Hg ( p = 0.02, interquartile range 1.038-11.712;   Table 4  ;   Fig. 4  ).

Overall, 19 (57.6%) patients relapsed, and 9 (27.3%) had a new WLL after  relapsing.  Treatment  of  relapsed  patients  is shown in   Table 5  .\nParticipating  physicians'  answers  to  the  survey  submitted are shown in   Table 6  . Overall, we noted that most of the 12 physicians believe that WLL is efficient and are not ready to abandon this approach for the benefit of other treatments.",

      "content": "WLL is performed by few experienced centers worldwide as PAP is a rare disease, and thus few studies report data on this procedure. The evaluation of WLL as an efficient method of treatment in PAP is an absolute necessity as in the recent years, novel therapies have emerged, such as GM-CSF   [7, 13]  , plasmapheresis   [8] and rituximab   [9]  . Our study reports data from expert centers on interventional pulmonology aiming to evaluate the efficacy of the technique as well as complications and differ-\nences in the application. Furthermore, our patients presented, in most of the cases (72%), with respiratory insufficiency at rest.\nImportant data reported in our study were the long duration of the procedure as well as the duration of anesthesia.  The  technique  varies  between  our  centers:  only 36.4%  used  percussion  during  the  procedure  when  it seemed to be recommended   [14, 15]  , some centers used flexible bronchoscopy instead of selective intubation, and in  1  case  flexible  bronchoscopy  under  local  anesthesia was used   [16]  . Flexible bronchoscopy is indicated when a patient  cannot  tolerate  general  anesthesia  or  presents\nValues are n (%).\nFEV1, FVC, total lung capacity and KCO mean values are expressed as percentage of the predicted values ± standard deviations, while PaO2 and PaCO2 are expressed as mm Hg ± standard deviations.\nwith less severe disease, or in pediatric cases   [16-18]  . This procedure is generally safe, yet less effective because of the use of a small lavage volume. Variations between the participating centers exist also in the patients' post-procedural management. In the majority of centers, patients stayed for a median of 2 days in intensive care after the procedure, while in other centers, patients returned to the pulmonary ward immediately. A possible explanation is the  disease  severity  and  patients'  condition  related  to PAP, but also the procedure modalities, such as single or double lung lavage   [6]  .\nIn a recent international multicenter survey involving 20  centers  worldwide    [19,  20]  ,  general  anesthesia  was used almost universally in  adults  with  a  double-lumen tracheal tube in 2 consecutive sessions (1 lung per session), with an interval of 1-2 weeks between WLL procedures observed by 50% of centers. The amount of fluid used to perform the WLL varied also greatly (800 mL of warm saline on average), with great variability of the total volume used per lung, with a range from 5 to 40 L. Most (14 of 20) centers used chest percussion to emulsify the PAP sediment to improve therapeutic efficiency. However, the method and timing varied greatly, as in our series. Ten centers (50%) used manual chest percussion and 4 (20%) used mechanical percussion. The authors finally concluded that WLL is safe and effective as a therapy for PAP. This study represents a first step in developing an evidence-based,  best-practice  approach  to  standardize WLL therapy for PAP   [19, 20]  .\nIn  our  series,  WLL  was  immediately  effective  in  17 (51.5%) patients, as only 1 WLL was sufficient to improve their condition. This is the case in most of the series, although the rates are higher than ours. This difference may be explained by the variability of the disease severity of the included patients in the different series, as well as by the fact that many of our patients had undergone other therapies previous to WLL, with secondary relapse   [21]  . A second lavage is common to complete the initial thera-\nValues are n (%).

Seymour and Presneill [6] in their analysis showed the effectiveness of WLL to improve survival in this patient population: in a group of 146 patients, the mean rate of survival at 5 years was 94% with lavage as compared to 85% without lavage, and this difference was statistically significant ( p = 0.04).\nAn overall improvement in PaO 2 was noted in our patient  population  after  WLL,  resulting  in  an  improved condition. No other PFT parameter was improved significantly  in  our  series,  although  there  was  a  trend  towards a significant improvement in K  CO  . This correlation between PaO  2 change (Δ PaO 2 ) and K  CO change (Δ K  CO  ) in our series was confirmed by the simple regression analysis (  Fig. 3  ). Lung function improvement after WLL has been reported previously   [6, 21, 22]  . In a Chinese cohort [21]  , most parameters of PFTs, such as FEV 1 , FVC, PaO 2 and K  CO  ,  improved after WLL, confirming the data of Seymour and Presneill   [6]  . Again, variability between the different series in the improvement of PFTs might be due to the time point of data collection and the severity of the disease, as many patients presenting with severe disease are in fact unable to perform PFTs.\nIn our study, the median age of the patients was 44 years, confirming that PAP occurs in a young age group, supporting the same finding noted by most authors reporting  data  from  Caucasian  populations    [6,  21,  22]  . However, in Asian populations a controversy exists on whether PAP patients are young   [23] or old   [24]  . The reasons for this discrepancy are unclear but might be associated with patient selection, ethnic differences or simply the heterogeneity of the disease itself. Also, 81.8% of patients had primary PAP   [1, 2]  , and 84.8% presented with a  typical  BAL  fluid  sufficient  for  diagnosis  as  in  other Caucasian series   [1]  , compared to only 58.7% in a Japanese cohort   [24]  . In our cohort, only 2 HRCT were atypical, and all our patients with primary PAP had positive\nGM-CSF antibodies,  showing  that  the  combination  of HRCT, BAL and GM-CSF antibodies is sufficient to diagnose primitive PAP. Another option for a minimally invasive diagnosis of PAP is transbronchial biopsy, especially in children   [16, 17]  . However, 16% of our patients underwent surgical biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.\nAlthough spontaneous remission may occur in some patients, most of them require therapy because respiratory insufficiency is present, expressed by dyspnea   [22, 23]  . Indeed, dyspnea was present in 90% of our cases and was associated with hypoxemia at rest in 72% of our patients,  resulting  in  therapeutic  intervention    [22]  .  Concerning the procedure itself, we had a 7-month median interval  between diagnosis and first WLL, while in the literature the average is 2 months   [6]  . This difference was due to the fact that some of our patients were referred for lavage after having simply been followed up or after failure of their initial treatment, such as GM-CSF   [6]  .\nOverall, 57% of patients presented with secondary relapse in our series. This high rate of relapses is well known [2, 6]  . The mechanism is not fully understood, yet the accumulation  of  surfactant  according  to  disease  severity and cause is a determining factor   [2]  . The management of relapses in our study varied between the centers; some treated relapses with multiple lavages, while others treated them with newer therapies, such as rituximab   [9] or inhaled GM-CSF   [7] associated with lavage or not. Yet, no  studies  have  systematically  addressed  the  effect  of combination  therapy  in  PAP  patients.  Uncommonly, corticoids have been used with no results   [25] as was the case in 1 of our patients.\nEither inhaled   [7] or subcutaneous   [13] GM-CSF has been suggested alternatively. Indeed, a recent prospective study in 39 patients with autoimmune PAP showed efficacy in 62% of the cases   [7]  . A meta-analysis of GM-CSF observational  studies    [26]  suggested  a  cumulative  response rate that was slightly lower (58%) with GM-CSF therapy in autoimmune PAP, with a better response via\nValues are n (%). WLL, whole-lung lavage.\nthe inhaled route than via the subcutaneous route (76 vs. 48%)   [26]  . However, 30% of the GM-CSF responders relapsed during follow-up, and the number of relapses was less in the inhaled than in the subcutaneous group, probably because of the direct local deposition in the alveolar space, which is the putative site of GM-CSF signal disruption   [26]  .  Furthermore,  the  inhaled  GM-CSF may prevent long-term myelosuppression encountered with the subcutaneous route   [14, 26]  , especially in young patients [16]  . This therapy alone is indicated in mild to moderate PAP   [14]  ; however, no clinical or biological marker exists today to predict response to GM-CSF and to select patients that could benefit from GM-CSF therapy   [3]  . Indeed, the concentration of anti-GM-CSF antibodies and evolution  under  therapy  do  not  seem  to  be  associated with response   [3]  .\nRituximab,  a  monoclonal  antibody  directed  against the CD20 antigen of B-lymphocytes, may also be an alternative therapy, as it has shown activity in an open-label study   [9]  . In 10 patients with PAP, improvements were noted in PaO  2  , total lung capacity, HRCT and dyspnea [9]  . However, following rituximab therapy, high relapse rates have also been reported   [14]  . Plasmapheresis might be another option, but it has been tested in a few cases only   [8, 27]  . However, this technique may lead to serious complications, such as life-threatening sepsis   [27]  , while non-response may lead to WLL   [28]  .\nComplications in our study occurred in 33% of patients overall, with an immediate drop of SaO 2 during the procedure in 12.1% of patients as in other studies   [15]  . In 1 case, a loss of bronchial isolation was reported with no serious consequences (procedure prolongation)   [15]  , and in another case a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia was noted but successfully treated. One patient reported headache and fever without evidence of infection, probably due to anesthesia. Unexplained subcutaneous emphysema occurred in 1 case; it was not associated  with  pneumothorax    [15]  .  Finally,  another  patient had a moderate pulmonary edema appearing a few days after the procedure. The origin of this edema is not fully understood, yet the cause might be cardiogenic (due to the roughness of the procedure) or non-cardiogenic (local inflammatory reaction) due to the procedure itself [29]  . We counted 2 deaths; one was related to the severity of the disease at presentation (PAP-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome), where WLL was obviously not effective, and the other was secondary to a myeloid disorder, which is the most common association   [30]  .\nInterestingly, most of the physicians participating in the study considered that there is a therapeutic benefit of\nWLL in patients with PAP. This is the first study in the literature reporting results from a physicians' survey. Our first  question  concerning  the  routine  practice  of  WLL (  Table 6  ) was intended to check whether, indeed, all centers were 'experts' in performing the procedure, in order to have a homogenous sample. On the other hand, this positive opinion may also reflect a selection bias among expert  endoscopists,  though  a  necessary  one.  Indeed, PAP should always be managed in a center with experience and knowledge and which has a track record on the safety and effectiveness of the procedure   [31]  . The participating  physicians  do  not  consider  changing  their opinion about the utility of WLL as a first-line treatment and, therefore, are not ready to abandon this procedure for another therapy. This point of view is probably related to many factors: firstly, the patients treated by those centers  have  severe  disease  with  respiratory  insufficiency; secondly,  physicians  performing  WLL  are  thoracic  endoscopy experts, and thirdly, no other therapeutic alternative has proven to be clearly more efficient in this patient population with severe PAP   [14]  .\nTo conclude, our study shows that in patients with severe PAP, WLL still has a role to play, although the application  of  the  technique  varies  between  the  different participating expert centers. However, a long-term effect needs to be confirmed, as many of our patients relapsed.",
