Ultrasound has emerged as a useful tool in order to assist PDT, potentially improving its success rate and reducing procedural-related complications. Objective: To investigate whether the ultrasound-guided PDT is equivalent or superior to the bronchoscopy-guided or anatomical landmarks-guided PDT with regard to procedural-related and clinical complications. Methods: A systematic review of randomized clinical trials was conducted comparing an ultrasound-guided PDT to the control groups (either a bronchoscopy-guided PDT or an anatomical landmarkguided PDT) in patients undergoing a PDT in the ICU. The primary outcome was the incidence of major procedural-related and clinical complication rates. The secondary outcome was the incidence of minor complication rates. Random-effect meta-analyzes were used to pool the results. Results: Four studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and they were analyzed. The studies included 588 participants. There were no differences in the major complication rates between the patients who were assigned to the ultrasound-guided PDT when compared to the control groups (pooled risk ratio [Relative risk (RR)]: 0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.131.71, I 2 ¼ 0%). The minor complication rates were not different between the groups, but they had a high heterogeneity (pooled Relative risk (RR): 0.49; 95% CI 0.16-1.50; I 2 ¼ 85%). The sensitivity analyzes that only included the randomized controlled trials that used a landmark-guided PDT as the control group showed lower rates of minor complications in the ultrasound-guided PDT group (pooled Relative risk (RR): 0.55; 95% CI: 0.31-0.98, I 2 ¼ 0%). Conclusion: The ultrasound-guided PDT seems to be safe and it is comparable to the bronchoscopy-guided PDT regarding the major and minor procedural-related or clinical complications.

The potential advantages of ultrasound include the ability of identifying the cervical vasculature 8 to help in identifying the most appropriate location for the tracheal puncture site, as well as in guiding the needle's insertion into the trachea, which is similar to the technique as used in ultrasound-guided vascular punctures. Several case series and observational studies have demonstrated the value of preprocedural cervical ultrasound and the use of real time ultrasound guidance in improving the safety of PDT, suggesting that the method is effective and safe 9 . A few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been published suggesting that the use of real-time ultrasound-guided PDT may significantly improve the rate of first-pass punctures, the puncture's accuracy, as well as reducing the procedural-related complications, when compared to the anatomical landmark-guided PDT 10,11 and the bronchoscopy-guided PDT. 12,13 Nevertheless, most of these trials are small and limited by their sample size and their quality of data.\nAs a result, we have performed a systematic review and have conducted meta-analyzes in order to investigate whether the ultrasound-guided PDT is equivalent or even superior to the bronchoscopy-guided PDT or to the anatomical landmarkguided PDT, with regard to the procedural-related safety and clinical complications.",

No language restrictions were applied. A sensitive search strategy was conducted, combining the following keywords and the Boolean Operators of 'AND' and 'OR': ('tracheostomy' OR 'tracheotomy') AND ('ultrasound' OR 'ultrasonography' OR 'echography'). In addition to the electronic searches, we checked the cross references from the original articles and reviews. We retrieved additional case studies by hand, searching the Abstracts from the Meetings of the American Thoracic Society, the Society of Critical Care Medicine, and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine. These were all held between 2010 and 2017. Completed but unpublished studies were identified by searching the various websites on the Public Registers of Clinical Trials. Neither ethical approval nor\npatient consent was needed for these meta-analyzes.

All of the studies were single center, unblinded, and included patients admitted to an ICU. Two of the studies compared the ultrasound-guided PDT with the anatomical landmark-guided PDT, 10,11 while the 2 additional studies compared ultrasoundguided PDT with bronchoscopy-guided PDT. 12,13 The studies that were conducted by Rudas et al 11 and Gobatto et al 13 followed up the patients until their hospital discharge. The followup period in the study that was conducted by Yavuz et al 10 lasted from 3 to 8 months after the tracheostomy. In the study that was conducted by Ravi and Vijay, the follow-up period was unclear. 12 Multiple trainee intensivists or senior intensivists performed the PDT procedures in the trials that were conducted by Rudas et al, 11 Ravi and Vijay, 12 and Gobatto et al. 13 A single clinician was responsible for performing all of the PDTs in the Yavuz trial. 10\nIn the 4 included studies, the ultrasound-guided PDTs were performed under real-time ultrasound guidance. Three of the trials 10,12,13 used the forceps dilator technique as described by Griggs et al, 19 and 1 trial 11 used the single dilator technique as described by Ciaglia. 20 The patients' characteristics for each study are described in Table 2.\nMost of the included patients in the 4 included studies did not have a difficult anatomy, for example, in the study conducted by Rudas et al, 11 no patient was classified as having a difficult anatomy. However, in the other trials, there was a considerable number of patients with difficult anatomy. In the trial by Yavuz et al, 10 85 (24.9 % ) patients had a short neck in the overall population. In Ravi and Vijay, 12 26 (35 % ) patients were obese, 12 (16 % ) patients had a short neck, and 14 (19 % ) patients had tracheal deviation.

      "content": "Our systematic review and the meta-analyzes have shown that the ultrasound-guided PDT when compared to the control groups (the bronchoscopy-guided PDT or the anatomical landmark-guided PDT) had no differences in the rates of procedural-related and clinical major or clinical minor complications. Furthermore, the sensitivity analyzes suggests that the ultrasound-guided PDT might reduce the minor complications when compared to the anatomical landmark-guided PDT but not when compared to the bronchoscopy-guided PDT.\nThe major and minor complication outcomes were calculated for each study from a predefined list of standardized complications, instead of using the number of total complications provided by the authors. This method was chosen due to\nthe high variability of the reports and the definitions among the included trials. This standardization list was based on the trial by Gobatto et al. 13\nThe number of major complications was low in all of the 4 trials, ranging from 0 % to 2.2 % , which is similar to previously published complication rates. In the 2 largest retrospective cohorts that analyzed those patients who were submitted to a PDT, which included 4162 patients, the major complication rates ranged from 0.4 % to 1.4 % , 4,21 which was similar to the 1.8 % major complications rate in our pooled analyzes. The major complication rates were not different between the ultrasound-guided PDT and the bronchoscopy-guided PDT or the anatomical landmark-guided PDT. This low complication rate is a potential limitation to this analysis since these trials may have been underpowered to detect such small differences, even when they were combined in the meta-analyzes.\nWith a standardization of the definitions, the minor complication rates were highly variable, ranging from 9.6 % to 37.8 % ,\nprobably reflecting the different populations and the interventions among the included trials. The total minor complications were not different when comparing the ultrasound-guided PDT with the bronchoscopy-guided PDT or the anatomical landmark-guided PDT. However, in the sensitivity analyzes, when the ultrasound-guided PDT was compared to the anatomical landmark-guided PDT, there was a lower rate of minor complications in the ultrasound-guided group.\nUltrasound can assist in the identification of the cervical vasculature, 8 the definition of the most appropriate location for the tracheal puncture site, as well as in guiding the needle's insertion into the trachea. The tracheal puncture site might change up to 50 % of the times when a cervical ultrasound is performed after the puncture site had been previously defined by the anatomical landmarks. 22 Furthermore, the ultrasoundguided PDT is faster and may significantly improve the rate of first-pass punctures and the puncture's accuracy when compared to the anatomical landmark-guided PDT. 11 Taken together, this information might explain the superiority of the ultrasound-guided PDT to the anatomical landmark-guided PDT when reducing the complications that are related to PDT. However, caution is advised since these results were only derived from analyzes of 2 of the 4 trials that were initially included in the systematic review, with a limited number of patients and low incidence of events.\nMost of the included patients in the 4 trials did not have a difficult anatomy. However, there was a considerable number of patients with difficult anatomy, especially in the trials conducted by Yavuz, 23 Ravi and Vijay, 12 and Gobatto et al. 13 In the trial conducted by Ravi and Vijay, 12 26 (35 % ) patients were obese, and in the trial by Yavuz et al, 10 85 (24.9 % ) patients had a short neck. Thus, the results of this systematic review might be generalizable to these patients.\nThe results of this meta-analysis lead to another consideration. Either bronchoscopy-guided PDT or ultrasound-guided PDT seems to improve safety of the procedure, at least with regard to minor complications. However, none of the trials tested the hypothesis that these 2 methods may, indeed, be complementary. Although bronchoscopy can help to observe what is actually happening in the trachea during the procedure, such as posterior wall puncture, ultrasound is able to identify abnormal cervical structures or vasculature and to guide the correct puncture site with visualization of the guidewire. Therefore, there seems to be space for a combined approach in order to enhance procedural safety.\nThe average quality of the included trials was only moderate. Two of the trials were qualified as having a better caliber, 11,13 by showing a low risk of bias in the random sequence generation, in the allocation concealment, together with the incomplete outcome data and the selective reporting. The blinding of the participants and personnel exhibited a high risk of bias in all included trials, due to the nature of the procedures. In the other 2 included trials, 10,12 there was an unclear description of the random sequence generation and the allocation concealment, elevating these 2 trials into a risk of bias.\nThis systematic review has had some limitations. First, in spite of the literature search that was conducted, only 4 trials were identified. No study that had been published in the nonindexed journals or in the conference proceedings was identified. Second, the included studies had a significant heterogeneity when they were evaluated for minor complications. Third, the studies were all single-center and they had relatively small sample sizes. Fourth, all of the trials had different protocols. The trials also used differing PDT techniques (3 used a forceps dilator and 1 used a single dilator). Fifth, the trials had different physicians with dissimilar experiences when performing the procedures.",

      "content": "This systematic review has shown that the ultrasound-guided PDT is safe. It was comparable to the bronchoscopy-guided PDT when considering the major and minor complications. Furthermore, the ultrasound-guided PDT seems to reduce the minor complications when compared to the anatomical landmark-guided PDT. As a result, the ultrasound-guided PDT might represent an alternative to the bronchoscopy-guided PDT or the anatomical landmark-guided PDT.",
