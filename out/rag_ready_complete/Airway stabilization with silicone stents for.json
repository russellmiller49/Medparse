Coexisting Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is not an absolute contraindication to a stenting trial in this population. Stenting is associated with a high number of short-term and long-term but generally reversible complications.\n(CHEST 2007; 132:609-616)\nKey words: airway stabilization; bronchoscopy; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); stent placement; tracheobronchomalacia\nAbbreviations: ATS = American Thoracic Society; BDI = baseline dyspnea index; KPS = Karnofsky performance scale; 6MWT = 6-min walk test; SGRQ = St. George respiratory questionnaire; TBM = tracheobronchomalacia; TDI = transitional dyspnea index\nT racheobronchomalacia (TBM) is an abnormal collapse of the tracheal and bronchial walls. It is characterized by flaccidity of the supporting tracheal and bronchial structures and a significant reduction of airway diameter on expiration seen in the trachea and/or in the mainstem bronchi. 1,2\nThe prevalence of TBM in adults is unknown. The incidence may be as high as 23% among patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) undergoing bronchoscopy, 3 and may\nrepresent 1% of all patients undergoing bronchoscopy. 4 One study 5 found TBM to be the cause of chronic cough in 14% of nonsmoking patients.\nThe cause of TBM is often unknown, but it is frequently seen in patients with common respiratory conditions such as chronic bronchitis and emphysema. 6 This pathologic narrowing can produce dynamic outflow obstruction with symptoms such as dyspnea, orthopnea, cough, wheezing, and the in-\nINTERVENTIONAL PULMONOLOGY\nability to clear secretions, predisposing the patient to recurrent infections and wheezing. Some patients may present with stridor, respiratory failure leading to intubation, or immediate respiratory failure after extubation. 7,8\nThe severity of TBM is conventionally graded by the degree of airway collapse during forced expiration (intrathoracic malacia) or inspiration (extrathoracic malacia). Based on expert opinion, collapse < 50% is within normal limits, while 50 to 75% is mild, 75 to 90% is moderate, and 91 to 100% (approximation of posterior membrane to the anterior luminal surface) is severe malacia.\nTracheomalacia has been recognized with increased frequency due to both improved clinical awareness and diagnostic imaging. While most experts still agree that functional bronchoscopy is the 'gold standard' for diagnosis, there are no standardized protocols guiding respiratory maneuvers and airway measurements during these procedures. In the past few years, dynamic airway CT has proved to be highly sensitive for the diagnosis of malacia. 9\nCurrent treatments include techniques that splint the central airways, such as continuous positive airway pressure, 10 silicone airway stents, 11 and surgical tracheobronchoplasty. 12 In patients with severe, symptomatic TBM, stenting may provide symptomatic relief through airway stabilization. Unfortunately, most reports of this approach are anecdotal, and no controlled study has assessed the efficacy of airway stents for treating tracheomalacia. 13,14 This prospective study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of silicone airway stents in improving symptoms, quality of life, lung function, and exercise capacity in patients with severe TBM.",

      "content": "The institutional review board of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center approved the protocol and patients gave written informed consent. We conducted a prospective, observational study from January 2002 to September 2006 in all patients referred to our Complex Airway Center for the evaluation of respiratory symptoms presumed to be caused by TBM. All patients who underwent central airway stenting (tracheal, mainstem bronchus, or both) for the treatment of severe TBM (n = 58) were considered for evaluation.\nSevere TBM was defined by near-total or total airway collapse (with approximation of posterior and anterior luminal surfaces) observed during bronchoscopy. Patients were receiving maximal medical therapy for comorbidities such as obstructive airway disease. Those treatments included inhaled short-acting bronchodilators ( 𝛃 -adrenergic and anticholinergic), long-acting bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, and oral corticosteroids.\nAge, sex, comorbidities, and respiratory symptoms were recorded at baseline. All patients underwent dynamic airway CT and functional bronchoscopic assessment. In addition, unselected subsets of patients underwent spirometry testing, 6-min walk test (6MWT), and completed standardized questionnaires including the modified St. George respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ), 15 baseline dyspnea index (BDI)/transitional dyspnea index (TDI), 16 American Thoracic Society (ATS) dyspnea score, and Karnofsky performance scale (KPS). 17\nSilicone stents were placed in all patients to stabilize the airway. Tracheal, bronchial, and bifurcated silicone stents (Dumon tracheal stent size 16, Dumon bronchial stent size 14, and Dumon bifurcated (Y-stent) sizes 14-18; Novatech-Boston Medical Products; Westborough, MA). The degree and location of malacia, the type and location of stent placement, and any complications during stent insertion were also recorded.\nAt a scheduled follow-up visit 10 to 14 days after the procedure, patients were asked whether symptoms had improved and baseline measurements were repeated. The 2-week window was chosen to minimize confounding factors, such as possible stent complications and any potential long-term impacts of physical conditioning between stent placement and follow-up measurements. Patients were followed up after that for any stent-related complications.",

Helical scanning was performed in the craniocaudal dimension during both endinspiratory and dynamic expiratory phases.\nTo calculate the percentage of luminal collapse, the estimated dynamic expiratory cross-sectional area was subtracted from the end-inspiratory cross-sectional area, divided by the end-inspira-\ntory cross-sectional area, and then multiplied by 100. Malacia was determined to be present if the percentage of luminal collapse during dynamic expiration was ≥ 50%. The distribution of malacia in the trachea and bronchi was also recorded (Fig 2).\nSpirometry was performed using the ATS guidelines. 19 FEV1 was measured at baseline and after stent placement. A change of 0.2 L from baseline was considered clinically important.\nThe 6MWT, an objective evaluation of functional exercise\ncapacity, was performed according to ATS guidelines. 20 An improvement > 230 feet was considered clinically important. 21\nWe used the BDI and the TDI as objective measures of dyspnea. The BDI represents the severity of dyspnea at baseline and is based on three components: functional impairment, magnitude of the task, and the magnitude of the effort. Each component is scored 0 to 4, so the summed scores range from 0 (severe) to 12 (normal). The TDI indicates the change from baseline. The TDI uses the same components as the BDI, but each component is graded from - 3 (major deterioration) to + 3 (major improvement). The summed scores range from - 9 (major deterioration) to + 9 (major improvement). 16\nThe ATS dyspnea score, although less well studied, is easy to use and also provides an objective measurement for dyspnea in this population. Scores range from 0 (no dyspnea) to 4 (severe dyspnea).\nA modified SGRQ 15 was used to measure the impact of respiratory symptoms on overall health, daily life, and perceived well-being. The questionnaire has been widely used in patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. In our study, many patients had Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, or both. The questionnaire has three dimensions (symptoms, activities, and impacts). Each dimension describes the respiratory problems encountered by the patient in the preceding 2 weeks (instead of 4 weeks) and is scored from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating poorer health. Empirical data and interviews with patients indicate that a mean change score of 4 U is associated with a slightly efficacious treatment, 8 U with a moderately efficacious treatment, and 12 U with a highly efficacious treatment. 15,22\nThe KPS, which classifies patients by functional impairment,\nhas been used to compare the effectiveness of different therapies and to assess the prognosis of individual oncology, geriatric, and stroke patients. 23,24 Scores range from 0 to 100. The lower the score, the greater the impairment and the worse the prognosis. 25",

      "content": "Of 75 patients referred for assessment of TBM during the study period, 58 had severe TBM and\nwere able to undergo therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy under general anesthesia. The patients included in this study were on average 69 years old (range, 39 to 91 years), and 34 patients (59%) were men. Among all patients, 33 patients had Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (57%; median FEV1, 1.07 L); 13 patients (22%) had asthma; 16 patients (28%) had obstructive sleep apnea; 16 patients (28%) had gastroesophageal reflux disease; and 3 patients (5%) had Mounier Kuhn syndrome, with some patients suffering from more than one (Fig 4, top , A ).\nAlmost all patients (n = 57, or 98%) had dyspnea as a sole symptom or in combination with cough and recurrent infections. Four patients presented with respiratory failure and required mechanical ventilation (Fig 4, bottom , B ).\nMost patients (n = 46, or 80%) had diffuse TBM\nand were treated with either a combination of a silicone tracheal and left main stent (n = 19) or a Y-stent (n = 27). Six patients each were treated only with bronchial or only with tracheal stents.\nThe following numbers of subjects had baseline and follow-up data collected for each outcome: SGRQ, n = 38 and n = 27; BDI/TDI, n = 41 and n = 24; ATS dyspnea score, n = 41 and n = 29; KPS, n = 41 and n = 26; 6MWT, n = 36 and n = 17; and FEV1, n = 42 and n = 10, respectively. For all measures, median baseline values of those patients in whom follow-up was also obtained were comparable to baseline median values for all patients.\nSGRQ, BDI/TDI, ATS, and KPS scores improved among both the complete sample with baseline and follow-up measures and the subset of patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). There were no significant changes in 6MWT results or FEV 1 (Table 1).\nOn self-reported symptoms, dyspnea improved, secretions cleared, or both, after stent placement in 45 patients. In 10 patients, symptoms were unchanged or worsened after stent placement. In the remaining three patients, changes were equivocal because some symptoms improved while others worsened. Of the 33 patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 25 patients reported improved symptoms, 7 reported no improvement, and 1 could not determine whether symptoms had changed. In the 25 non-Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, 20 patients reported improvement of symptoms, 3 reported no improvement, and 2 could not determine whether their symptoms had changed (Fig 5).\nMost patients who responded reported improvement immediately after stent placement. All four patients admitted to the hospital with respiratory failure secondary to TBM were weaned off mechanical ventilation after stent placement.\nComplications occurred usually within the first 3 months (median, 26 days; range, 3 to 865 days). Of these complications, 44 complications (90%) were related to the stent, 5 to bronchoscopy, and none to anesthesia. Complications included stent obstruction\nA\nsecondary to mucous plugging (n = 21), infection (n = 14), stent migration (n = 10), severe cough (n = 3), subglottic edema (n = 3), and stent breakage (n = 1). All complications were treated in standard fashion with mucolytics, cough suppressants, and stent removal or replacement if necessary (Fig 6). Stenting improved the median scores of all clinical end points, and most patients reported improvement (Table 1; Fig 7, 8).",

      "title": "Discussion",
      "content": "There is a need for a higher clinical suspicion and a standardized approach to objectively evaluate for TBM in the patient with dyspnea refractory to traditional therapies. Therapeutic airway stenting is often considered, but evidence for the efficacy of this approach has not been adequately characterized. In this largest prospective study to date, we found that stenting produced statistically significant and clinically important improvement in dyspnea, healthrelated quality of life, and functional status in a\nselected patient population with severe TBM. As there were no concurrent changes in medication or physical rehabilitation, we attribute these positive outcomes to the impact of central airway stabilization.\nImportantly, 33 of our 58 patients (57%) had Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In these patients, TBM is often believed to be an extension of peripheral airway obstruction. In fact, it has been suggested in retrospective, uncontrolled studies 26 that TBM in these patients may not be responsive to aggressive treatment. Our study suggests that Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients may benefit from central airway stabilization in severe TBM. Irrespective of any direct impact on flow limitation, TBM in these patients may worsen symptoms by impeding clearance of secretions and/or causing local air irritation resulting in recurrent infections and airway inflammation.\nInterestingly, even though some patients had improvement in the 6MWT scores, the improvement was not clinically or statistically significant. We speculate that it is unlikely that patients would undergo\nsubstantial reconditioning after only 2 weeks of symptomatic improvement, and thus we may have conducted follow-up to soon to see any change. We believe, however, that these patients, who could not undergo a pulmonary rehabilitation program before stenting, are now able to do so and a longer follow-up interval therefore may show improvement in exercise tolerance. Active data collection to address this issue is ongoing.\nFEV1 is frequently used as a surrogate end point for severity of obstructive lung diseases. 27,28 In our study, we found that clinical improvement was not associated with significant changes in FEV 1 in this population. Median FEV1 decreased by 0.05 L (p = 0.79), with first and third quartiles at -0.1 and 0.1, respectively.\nOn the downside, most complications we observed were related to the stents. Airway stents are often associated with reversible short-term and long-term complications. Complications were common in this study and included obstruction (by mucous plugging), infection, and migration with a peak incidence at 3 weeks. These complications were relatively easily managed by therapeutic suctioning, replacement, or removal of the stent and, if infection was a concern, with a 7- to 10-day antibiotic course. We\nchose to use silicone stents for a variety of reasons. In case of nonresponsiveness to airway stabilization, these stents are easily removed. Also, as other treatment modalities such as surgical placation are becoming available, permanent stenting may not be desirable. Thirdly, metallic stents in malacia patients are generally fraught with failure and complications and in contrast to silicone stents; their removal is problematic and potentially dangerous. For this reason, the Food and Drug Administration in July 2005 had emitted an alert notice for the use of covered and uncovered metallic stents in benign airway disorders (http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/safety).\nThere are notable limitations to our approach. Not all stented patients were administered both baseline and follow-up measures. In some cases, patient intake was too rapid to permit baseline assessment, while other patients were unavailable to complete all follow-up testing. There may have been factors related to either the indication for, or success of, treatment that were also associated with availability of pretreatment or posttreatment measures. These factors could bias our findings in favor of positive outcomes. Comparison of baseline measurements obtained on patients who also had follow-up measures, with the total baseline sample reveals no significant differences. This suggests that those available for poststent measurement were comparable to the total baseline sample.\nAdditionally, there is no control group to compare intervention against standard therapy. Since standard medical therapy for TBM is poorly defined, there was no accepted control condition. Patients were only enrolled after maximal medical therapy for comorbidities was provided.\nFinally, neither patients nor providers were blinded to diagnosis or treatment. Although we used well-standardized clinical and research tools for outcome measures, the potential for bias due to observer expectations or placebo effect cannot be ruled out.",

      "content": "Airway stabilization with silicone stents can improve symptoms in a highly selected patient population with severe TBM. The majority of our patients had marked improvement in dyspnea, health-related quality of life, and functional status in this short-term study. Patients with Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and severe TBM may also benefit from a stenting trial. Stenting is associated with a high number of short-term and long-term but generally reversible complications. Despite the obvious limitations, we believe the results of this study are compelling: patients with severe TBM\nshould be considered for airway stabilization, regardless of comorbidities, including Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Improvement needs to be carefully documented and in case of unresponsiveness, stents must be removed. Future research should compare stenting to other interventions, such as surgical tracheoplasty, in treating these patients. Additionally, better diagnostic parameters predicting a successful intervention need to be identified. We suggest that evaluation and treatment of tracheomalacia patients be done in experienced centers and all patients be enrolled in prospective outcome databases. A multicenter study with appropriate protocols may be best suited to answer the open questions.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT: We thank William Lunn, MD, Rabih Bechara, MD, Arthur Sung, MD, and Jed Gorden, MD, for assistance with the data collection, and Roger Davis, PhD, and Anantham Devanand, MD, for statistical assistance.",
