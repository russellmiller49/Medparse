    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Small cohort studies have shown rapid pleurodesis protocol's (RPP) effectiveness and capacity to expedite pleurodesis for malignant pleural effusion (MPE). This study intends to evaluate the effectiveness of the RPP in inducing pleurodesis in patients with pleural effusions from either malignant or benign etiologies. METHODS: In this single-center, retrospective cohort study spanning 2 decades, we assessed patients with recurrent symptomatic chronic noninfectious pleural effusion, both benign and malignant. Post-RPP, chest tubes were removed when fluid output dropped below 150 mL/d, and patients were discharged with daily indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) drainage. Exclusion criteria included nonexpandable lung and active pleural infection. Treatment success was defined as IPC removal on reduced output (<50 mL) on 3 consecutive drainages and radiologic effusion resolution. Recurrence was defined as the occurrence of pleural effusion requiring additional pleural procedures postsuccess. Duration outcome was expressed as median with IPC placement as time zero. RESULTS: Of the 210 patients studied, 72% had MPE, and 28% had benign effusions. The median hospital stay was 4 days post-RPP. Treatment was successful in 177 (84%) patients within a median of 12 days, with no significant differences between MPE and benign cases. Nine patients (5%) experienced recurrence within a median of 152 days. Complications included hemothorax in 4 (1.9%) and empyema in 2 (1%). The thirty-day mortality rate was 9%, with a median survival time of 245 days postprocedure. CONCLUSION: The RPP combines the benefit of chemical pleurodesis and IPC and appears to be a reasonable option for patients with recurrent and symptomatic pleural effusion.",

Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) occurs in about 15% 1 of cancer patients, representing advanced disease, and has a survival of about 3 to 12 months. 2 De /uniFB01 nitive treatment strategies for patients with recurrent, symptomatic MPE (manifested as dyspnea) include either obliteration of the pleural space via pleurodesis or periodic effusion drainage using an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC). 3 On the other hand, chronic benign pleural effusions (BPE) typically result from congestive heart failure (CHF), hepatic hydrothorax, renal failure, or nonspeci /uniFB01 c pleuritis. BPE treatment primarily targets the root cause, typically employing diuresis. When medical management fails to address a persistent and symptomatic pleural effusion, the management aligns with that of MPE. 4,5\nChemical pleurodesis involves the instillation of a sclerosant agent either via a chest tube (slurry) or thoracoscopically (poudrage). Postprocedure, patients typically require a 3- to 7-day hospital stay to ensure effective chemical pleurodesis through chest tube drainage and pleural apposition. 6 -8 Conversely, IPC is often placed in an ambulatory setting and does not require hospital admission. The rate of pleurodesis for IPC is 24% to 47%, which occurs in an average duration of 52 to 90 days. 6,9,10 IPC and chemical pleurodesis have been shown to be equally effective at relieving dyspnea. 6 Drawbacks of chemical pleurodesis include the need for hospital stay and a high failure rate (20% to 30% at 3 mo). 7,11,12 Patients with IPC still have the burden of chronic pleural effusion requiring regular drainage of the IPC, and face limitations of having the IPC in place.\nThe ideal treatment modality in this patient population is one that quickly and effectively relieves dyspnea, achieves\nDOI: 10.1097/LBR.0000000000000993 Copyright © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The rapid pleurodesis protocol (RPP) was /uniFB01 rst described by Reddy and colleagues; this protocol integrates chemical pleurodesis during medical thoracoscopy with IPC plus with a large-bore chest tube placement. 13 Under this protocol, patients typically remain hospitalized for a median duration of 1.79 days until the initial drainage chest tube is removed, a process usually completed within one day. This method aims to harness the bene /uniFB01 ts of both earlier described techniques while mitigating their shortcomings. In this small single-center study, the RPP demonstrated a 92% pleurodesis success rate, with a median time of 7.5 days, facilitating IPC removal. 13 In contrast to the RPP, the IPC-Plus study avoids hospitalization by performing the administration of talc pleurodesis via IPC in the outpatient setting. 14 The ongoing randomized controlled trial comparing thoracoscopic talc poudrage + indwelling IPC versus thoracoscopic talc poudrage only (TACTIC) employs a similar strategy as the RPP. 15\nWe believe that the RPP adds to the armamentarium for the management of BPE and MPE, and our 20-year realworld performance data will guide physicians and patients in their choice of intervention. Our primary goal was to determine the rate of and time to pleurodesis success. Secondary goals included health care utilization, predictor of pleurodesis success, and patient survival rate.",

In some patients, at the discretion of the performing interventional pulmonologist, a pleural biopsy was performed to determine the etiology of the chronic pleural effusion. This was followed by placing a 15.5 French (Fr) IPC (PleurX) 16 under direct visualization.

Concluding the intervention, a 24 Fr chest tube was placed through the thoracoscopy port. Postprocedure chest x-rays were obtained. The chest tube and the IPC were kept on a -20 cmH2O suction regimen, and their output was assessed daily.

Almost two thirds (69.5%) had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of ≤ 1. The etiology of the pleural effusion when undergoing the RPP was MPE and BPE in 72% and 28% of patients, respectively. Among those with MPE, 77.5% had a moderate LENT score, corresponding to a median survival rate of 130 days. 19 Lung cancer was the predominant cause of MPE, accounting for 39% of cases, followed by breast cancer and hematological malignancy at 11% each. Active chemotherapy was ongoing in 13% of patients with MPE during the RPP.\nRegarding pleural effusion size before intervention, 49% of the pleural effusions occupied < 25% of the ipsilateral hemithorax, 39% occupied between 25% and\n50%, and 12% occupied over 50% based on chest x-rays. Pleural effusion biochemical analysis showed 84% exudative effusions, with median levels of protein, lactate dehydrogenase, and cholesterol of 4.1 g/dL, 206 IU/L, and 76 mg/dL, respectively.\nTalc poudrage was the primary sclerosing agent, in 99% of cases (Table 2), with an average amount of 6.5 ± 1.8 g per procedure. Other agents, such as doxycycline and iodine, were each used once. Concurrent pleural biopsy was carried out in 75% of the cases. Postintervention, the median duration for chest tube placement and hospital stay were 2 and 4 days, respectively.\nThe RPP was successful in 84% of patients (177 out of 210), leading to IPC removal within a median of 12 days. At 30 days, 76% of IPCs were removed due to treatment success. Complications or failures resulted in removal in 7 (3%) cases, and 15 (7%) patients died with the IPC in place.

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "content": "In this study, we present the largest cohort to date showing the performance of the RPP outside of clinical trials, highlighting its effectiveness and unique capabilities in managing recurrent and symptomatic pleural effusion. This is the /uniFB01 rst study to encompass BPE as well as MPE, broadening the applicability and relevance of the RPP. Prior smaller studies focusing on the RPP in MPE demonstrated its remarkable ef /uniFB01 cacy in achieving pleurodesis (92% to 93%) within an abbreviated timeframe (7.5 to 10 d). 13,20 Building upon these, the current study con /uniFB01 rms this ef /uniFB01 cacious result with an 84% pleurodesis success rate achieved within a median of 12 days, while also expanding its applicability to BPE. This /uniFB01 gure is conservative, as the denominator for the success rate encompasses all patients in our cohort, including those who either died with an IPC in situ or still had an IPC at the last follow-up. Excluding these cases would likely yield an even higher success rate.\nOne of the key strengths of the RPP lies in its integration of the proven ef /uniFB01 cacy of chemical pleurodesis with the reliability of IPC in relieving dyspnea. Talc has been shown to be the most effective sclerosant agent for pleurodesis, 21 -23 which is the main agent used for RPP in our institution. Our ' real-world ' cohort of patients had a median length of stay of 4 days, similar to the 3 to 8 days length of stay achieved in talc pleurodesis trials. 6,7,11 This may be partly due to our internal protocol of pulling the chest tube once output is < 150 mL and repeating second pleurodesis if output is > 250 mL per day to maximize treatment success. This was a deviation from the original protocol described by Reddy et al whereby the chest tube was removed in 24 hours upon resolution of the pneumothorax and allowed the patient to be discharged 13 with drainage of the pleural effusion via the IPC. In addition, we had a signi /uniFB01 cant amount of patients with social issues that required an additional day in the hospital as the median time to chest tube removal was 3 days compared with the median hospital stay of 4 days. Our real-world pleurodesis failure rate of 16% (84% success rate) appears better than the 20% to 30% failure rate of chemical pleurodesis in a research trial setting. 7,11,12 And in the 16% of patients who did not achieve pleurodesis success, the presence of IPC for regular drainage allows for effective symptomatic relief. IPC has been demonstrated to alleviate dyspnea and improve quality of life. 24 Nonetheless, the patient is still faced with the burden of having chronic pleural effusion, requiring regular drainage of the IPC, and facing the limitation of having an IPC in place. Although the length of stay with the use of IPC alone for MPE is superior at 0 to 1 day, 6,25 the rate of pleurodesis is 24% to 47% in an average duration of 52 to 90 days, at which point the IPC can only be removed. 6,9,10 In this regard, RPP is the most effective treatment option for patients who want to be completely free from the burden of having a recurrent pleural effusion in the shortest possible time.\nThe use of MT in RPP could potentiate the pleurodesis process by inducing in /uniFB02 ammation as a consequence of the thoracoscopic incision and the pleural biopsy performed. 26 Moreover, the capacity of thoracoscopy to disrupt loculations enhances the rate of pleurodesis in cases of loculated effusions. 27 Beyond the therapeutic goal, the RPP also serves a diagnostic purpose, as concurrent pleural biopsy was performed in three quarters of our cases. After\nN = 177.\nLDH indicates lactate dehydrogenase; IPC, indwelling pleural catheter.\n4\n|\nwww.bronchology.com\ndischarge, the IPCs in the RPP were drained daily, which has been shown to be the optimal frequency for achieving pleurodesis, as shown by the AMPLE 2 trial. 24\nA simpli /uniFB01 ed variant of the RPP is talc administration via IPC in the outpatient setting. This was explored in the IPC-Plus trial, which showed that the pleurodesis rate was improved in IPC plus Talc versus IPC alone (43% vs. 23% at 35 d). 14 One variant of the RPP described by Foo and colleagues combined ambulatory thoracoscopic pleurodesis with IPC placement, where the nontunneled chest tube was removed on the same day upon resolution of procedure-induced pneumothorax and absence of air leak. The patient was discharged home on the same day of thoracoscopy. The patient did not stay in the hospital for the pleural effusion drainage but depended solely on IPC drainage. IPC was removed at a median of 20 days, and pleurodesis was deemed successful in 71% of patients at 3 months. 28 In another variant of RPP performed without chest tube drainage, but with inpatient IPC drainage, the success rate was 79% (23/29) at 1 month. 29 The above shows an increasing performance gap when speci /uniFB01 c components of the standard RPP are omitted. This underscores the importance of performing the chemical pleurodesis via MT followed by aggressive inpatient pleural effusion drainage to allow for pleural apposition for the chemical pleurodesis to be effective. The ongoing TACTIC trial employs the same post-thoracoscopic talc poudrage effusion drainage strategy as Foo and colleagues described above. 15\nA meta-analysis evaluating the predictor of successful chemical pleurodesis showed that MPE due to mesothelioma had the lowest success rate at 72%. In comparison, lymphoma and breast cancer had the highest success rates (89% and 87%, respectively). 30 Our data showed no difference in success rates between mesothelioma and breast cancer. However, hematological malignancies tended to take a longer time to achieve pleurodesis. Interestingly, our study did not corroborate several factors considered predictive of pleurodesis success, such as higher pleural effusion pH and smaller prepleurodesis effusion size. 30 The RPP was found to be more effective in pleural effusion with cholesterol > 45 mg/dL, a /uniFB01 nding consistent with previous literature that showed that higher pleural effusion cholesterol could be used to predict chemical pleurodesis success. 31\nIn contrast to MPE, there is limited evidence of the longterm relief of recurrent BPE. A meta-analysis on the use of IPC for BPE found an overall pleurodesis rate of 51% within a timeframe of 56 to 176 days. 32 In our study, RPP for BPE was predominantly for nonspeci /uniFB01 c pleuritis followed by CHF. A small study of thoracoscopic talc pleurodesis in CHF showed a recurrence rate of 5%. 4 This was higher than our /uniFB01 ndings, which showed only a 2% recurrence rate among 50 patients with BPE. In CHF, the vast performance gap between RPP and IPC alone is still evident, with the RPP group achieving an 80% IPC removal in the median of 11.5 days, compared with a 25% success rate in the median of 66 days with IPC alone. 33 A direct comparison between MPE and BPE indicated that MPE achieved pleurodesis in a shorter time with IPC, taking only 36 days compared with 110 days. 5 The RPP performed equally well in BPE as in MPE and can be used for the goal of rapidly achieving pleurodesis and independence from IPC.\nWhile the RPP offers numerous bene /uniFB01 ts, its ef /uniFB01 cacy comes at a cost. Sha /uniFB01 q and colleagues performed a costutility analysis of the various treatment modalities for MPE. For an estimated survival of 6 months, IPC ($7314) was\nfound to be the most cost-effective modality, and unfortunately, RPP ($7650 to $11,439) was deemed cost-ineffective even with an estimated 85% lasting pleurodesis. 34 On the other hand, bedside chemical pleurodesis is the most costeffective treatment for patients, with an expected survival of 12 months. 35 The assumptions made by these studies were that the MPE was already diagnosed, but we performed a pleural biopsy as part of the RPP (75%), making it a onestop diagnostic and treatment modality. The RPP is more cost-effective in patients with BPE, given their longer life expectancy.\nSince the RPP consists of chemical pleurodesis and IPC, contraindication to either intervention applies to the RPP. In cases of NEL, this restriction is grounded in the inef /uniFB01 cacy of chemical pleurodesis under the circumstances of lacking parietal and visceral pleural apposition. This led to the exclusion of patients with recurrent pleural effusion and NEL from our study. The signi /uniFB01 cance of this limitation is underscored by the prevalence of NEL in 30% of MPE cases. 36 Contraindications to IPC placement include bleeding diathesis, infection at the potential site of placement, and inability or unwillingness of the patient to maintain regular IPC drainage. Active pleural infection is a contraindication to both chemical pleurodesis and IPC placement. One limitation of this study is its retrospective nature, which lacks complete data on patient ' s symptoms, such as dyspnea, pain, and quality of life. Our study also lacks a non-RPP comparative group and is vulnerable to selection bias. This constraint acknowledges the potential in /uniFB02 uence of factors related to the choice of treatment and their impact on study outcomes. The ongoing randomized controlled TACTIC trial will be able to assess these concerns. 15",
