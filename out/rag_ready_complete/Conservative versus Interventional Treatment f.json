    "abstract": "BACKGROUND Whether conservative management is an acceptable alternative to interventional management for uncomplicated, moderate-to-large primary spontaneous pneumothorax is unknown.\nMETHODS In this open-label, multicenter, noninferiority trial, we recruited patients 14 to 50 years of age with a first-known, unilateral, moderate-to-large primary spontaneous pneumothorax. Patients were randomly assigned to immediate interventional management of the pneumothorax (intervention group) or a conservative observational approach (conservative-management group) and were followed for 12 months. The primary outcome was lung reexpansion within 8 weeks.\nRESULTS A total of 316 patients underwent randomization (154 patients to the intervention group and 162 to the conservative-management group). In the conservativemanagement group, 25 patients (15.4%) underwent interventions to manage the pneumothorax, for reasons prespecified in the protocol, and 137 (84.6%) did not undergo interventions. In a complete-case analysis in which data were not available for 23 patients in the intervention group and 37 in the conservative-management group, reexpansion within 8 weeks occurred in 129 of 131 patients (98.5%) with interventional management and in 118 of 125 (94.4%) with conservative management (risk difference, −4.1 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], −8.6 to 0.5; P=0.02 for noninferiority); the lower boundary of the 95% confidence interval was within the prespecified noninferiority margin of −9 percentage points. In a sensitivity analysis in which all missing data after 56 days were imputed as treatment failure (with reexpansion in 129 of 138 patients [93.5%] in the intervention group and in 118 of 143 [82.5%] in the conservative-management group), the risk difference of −11.0 percentage points (95% CI, −18.4 to −3.5) was outside the prespecified noninferiority margin. Conservative management resulted in a lower risk of serious adverse events or pneumothorax recurrence than interventional management.\nCONCLUSIONS Although the primary outcome was not statistically robust to conservative assumptions about missing data, the trial provides modest evidence that conservative management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax was noninferior to interventional management, with a lower risk of serious adverse events.

Beasley, for the PSP Investigators*\nT he annual rate of hospitalization for  spontaneous  pneumothorax  among persons 15 years of age or older in England  is  approximately  140  per  million. 1   One third  of  cases  are  primary,  with  no  known previous  pneumothorax  or  clinically  apparent underlying lung disease. 1,2 There is considerable heterogeneity  in  the  management  of  primary spontaneous pneumothorax, 3-5  but the most common treatment is interventional drainage, sometimes progressing to surgical intervention. However, the insertion of a chest tube is often painful 6,7 and can cause organ injury, bleeding, and infection. 8 Insertion of a chest tube often involves hospitalization, with a reported mean length of stay of 4 days in patients with a first presentation with spontaneous pneumothorax. 9-11 Surgery, if  the air leak continues, has additional risks, complications, and costs. 11-13\nAn alternative approach is conservative management, with intervention reserved for patients for whom the pneumothorax becomes physiologically significant. 14  Conservative management is supported by evidence from a historical cohort study 15 ; however, there are not directive data from randomized, controlled trials that have compared conservative  with  interventional  management 16 to  determine their  relative  benefits  and  risks. We hypothesized that conservative management could be an effective and acceptable therapeutic option,  with  a  similar  percentage  of  patients with full lung reexpansion within 8 weeks as compared with interventional management, as well as a shorter length of hospital stay, fewer interventions and associated complications, and a lower risk of pneumothorax recurrence.",

      "content": "A sample of 274 patients was required to detect an  absolute  noninferiority  margin  of  -9  percentage points, under the assumption of resolution of the pneumothorax by 8 weeks in 99% of the patients in the intervention group (one-sided alpha level of 5% and power of 95%). Noninferiority was tested by generating a two-sided 95% confidence interval and using the lower 2.5% tail to compare the observed data. In the absence of any previously established noninferiority margin, the steering committee of respiratory and emergency physicians reasoned that a success rate of 90% in the conservative-management group as compared with an anticipated 99% success rate in the intervention group after 8 weeks would be acceptable to both doctors and patients. Allowing for a 20% dropout rate, we planned to recruit up to 342 patients.\nThe primary analysis was based on logistic\nregression of complete cases at 8 weeks. Estimation of percentage points and absolute risk differences together with a binomial noninferiority test were used for the primary outcome. The  original  statistical  analysis  plan  did  not specify the window for the 8-week visit nor define how missing radiographic data were to be handled for the primary outcome. These issues were recognized post hoc to be important, because the intent of the trial was to establish whether there was resolution at the time of the 8-week visit. This goal was addressed by treating data on the primary outcome as missing in patients in whom the 8-week visit occurred after 56 days and by undertaking two sensitivity analyses to help determine the effects of informative censoring  and  treating  of  missing  data  as  treatment failure.\nOther categorical variables were analyzed by estimation of absolute risk differences and relative risks and a two-sided test. Count variables were  analyzed  by  estimation  of  relative  rates. Kaplan-Meier  curves  and  a  Cox  proportionalhazards estimate of the hazard ratio were used for the time until radiographic resolution, the time  until  symptom  resolution,  and  the  time until ipsilateral pneumothorax recurrence. Ordinal regression was used for the Likert-scaled satisfaction ratings. Logistic regression was used to  assess  subgroup  effects.  SAS  software,  version 9.4, was used for all analyses.",

The  mean  (±SD) length of hospital stay in the first 8 weeks for patients in the intervention group was 6.1±7.6 days, with a mean of 10.9±12.7 days off from work  in  the  same  period,  as  compared  with 1.6±3.5 days and 6.0±7.3 days, respectively, for patients in the conservative-management group (Hodges-Lehmann location shift [intervention group minus conservative-management group], 2.8 [95% CI, 1.8 to 3.6] for length of hospital stay and 2.0 [95% CI, 1.0 to 3.0] for days off from work) (Table 2 and Tables S5 and S7).

      "content": "This randomized, controlled trial of conservative as compared with interventional management of moderate-to-large primary spontaneous pneumo-\nthorax provides modest, but statistically fragile, evidence that conservative management was noninferior  to  interventional  management  for  radiographic resolution within 8 weeks, with the use  of  a  9-percentage-point  margin;  the  time until complete resolution of symptoms did not differ substantially between the two approaches. Conservative  management  spared  85%  of  the patients from an invasive intervention and resulted  in  fewer  hospitalization  days,  a  lower likelihood  of  prolonged  chest-tube  drainage, less need for surgery, and fewer adverse events and serious adverse events than interventional management. The percentage of patients with early pneumothorax recurrence was also lower in the conservative-management group.\nOur trial challenges the fundamental concept of whether initial routine drainage is required in all patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax. It was conducted at 39 centers across a spectrum of rural, urban, secondary, and tertiary health care settings, and after a standardized initial approach to randomized treatment, subsequent  interventions  were  undertaken  by treating clinicians as per their usual practice. Only  patients  with  moderate-to-large  primary spontaneous  pneumothorax,  for  which  most clinicians would intervene, were included. Recruitment was limited to those with a first episode  of  primary  spontaneous  pneumothorax (on the affected side) to avoid the confounding effects of previous treatments. The age range of 14 to 50 years reduced the likelihood that patients with secondary pneumothorax would be included.\nOur trial has several limitations. It was not possible  to  mask  trial-group  assignments  to patients or clinicians. Treating clinicians were more likely  than  the  independent  radiologists who  were  unaware  of  the  trial-group  assignments to report full radiographic resolution in the group receiving interventional management, which biased the primary-outcome findings in favor of interventional treatment. Although we used multiple radiographic examinations to identify pneumothorax recurrence, it is possible that some  episodes  of  recurrence  may  have  been missed, and there may have been different thresholds  for  presentation  with  recurrent  symptoms between the two groups. Conservative management was associated with fewer pneumothorax recurrences  than  interventional  management,\nwith divergence in the frequency of recurrence occurring during the first 3 months after initial presentation with primary spontaneous pneumothorax.  Some  of  these  early  recurrences  may have represented an ongoing slow leak despite initial reinflation or may have been due to rapid expansion of the lung (and hence the visceral pleural wound), with or without the use of suction, resulting in physical impairment of healing - contrary to the view that adhesions may form between the visceral pleura and the parietal pleura if the lung is reexpanded.\nA major limitation was that the original statistical  analysis  plan  did  not  specify  the  window for the 8-week visit nor define how missing  radiographic  data  were  to  be  handled  for the primary outcome. These issues were important,  because  22  patients  who  did  not  have resolution at their 4-week visit had resolution at the time of their scheduled 8-week visit, which occurred after 56 days. Although this issue was addressed by treating data for the primary outcome  as  missing  in  patients  in  whom  the 8-week visit occurred after 56 days and by undertaking two sensitivity  analyses  to  help  determine  the  effects  of  informative  censoring and treating of missing data as treatment failure, these approaches resulted in statistical fragility and need to be considered exploratory. In the sensitivity analysis in which all missing data were imputed as failure, the risk difference for radiographic resolution at 56 days in the conservative-management group was -11 percentage points, with a lower boundary of the 95% confidence  interval  of  -18  percentage  points. However, the median time until symptom resolution (approximately 2 weeks) was similar in the two groups, and a small residual pneumothorax is likely to be clinically significant only in the context of air travel. Secondary analyses have  not  been  adjusted  for  multiple  comparisons and should not be used to infer definitive treatment effects.\nThis trial provides modest evidence that conservative management was noninferior to interventional management for radiographic resolution of moderate-to-large primary spontaneous pneumothorax  within  8  weeks.  Conservative management spared 85% of the patients from an invasive intervention and incurred fewer days in the hospital or off from work, lower rates of surgery, and a lower risk of serious adverse events\n* A total of 49 adverse events occurred in 41 patients in the intervention group and 16 in 13 patients in the conservative-management group. Serious adverse events (defined as those that resulted in prolonged hospitalization, life-threatening or fatal illness, or intervention to prevent these outcomes) occurred in 19 patients in the intervention group and 6 in the conservativemanagement group.\n† The three instances of hemothorax in the conservative-management group were noted as a pleural effusion on the chest radiograph, before insertion of any chest tube. An additional hemothorax was associated with the tension pneumothorax reported in the conservative-management group.\n‡ The case of empyema in the conservative-management group and the infection of unknown site in the intervention group were associated with sepsis.\n§ One of the three skin infections in the intervention group was associated with sepsis.\n¶ Three cases of tension pneumothorax were reported, one in the conservative-management group (the patient presented again for care 30 hours after initial discharge) and two in the intervention group (one patient had an increase in pneumothorax size while an inpatient that was attributed to a kinked chest tube, and the other presented 4 days after initial discharge); all resolved promptly with insertion or adjustment of the chest tube.\n∥ One case was managed conservatively, and five cases were managed with reinsertion of the chest tube with or without video-assisted thoracoscopic pleurodesis.\n**    There was one case each of bleeding around the site of the chest tube, agitation, numbness around the site of the chest tube, and patient self-discharge with the drain in place.\n††   There was one case each of Horner's syndrome after insertion of the chest tube, death by suicide (unrelated to the trial), nausea and dizziness, and excessive scar tissue around the site of the chest tube.",
