      "content": "Surgery is the recommended treatment for early stage non-small cell lung cancer (Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)) and some pulmonary metastases. 1,2 However, many patients are not eligible candidates for surgical treatment due to medical\ncomorbidities. 3 As an alternative, stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) or image-guided ablation is recommended as a nonsurgical treatment modality. 1,4 Some patients cannot undergo SBRT due to prior radiation, radiation pneumonitis, or inappropriate tumor location. 5,6 Image-guided percutaneous thermal ablations such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA) have shown potential as an alternative to SBRT. 7,8\nFangfang Xie and Junxiang Chen contributed equally to this article.\nMeeting presentation: ERS International Congress 2020, Virtual, September 7 -9, 2020.\nThis is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License, which permits use and distribution in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited, the use is non-commercial and no modifications or adaptations are made. © 2022 The Authors. Thoracic Cancer published by China Lung Oncology Group and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.\nRFA has been the most widely used ablation method for the treatment of solid tumors. Although MWA is a relatively new technique, it is currently being used as a primary treatment option for solid tumor ablation. MWA has a lower heat sink effect in lesions close to large vessels due to its ability to produce high temperatures rapidly. 9 In animal models, percutaneous MWA creates larger and more regular zones of ablation than a similarly sized RFA. 10 Clinical studies found that percutaneous MWA was efficacious in both primary lung cancer and metastatic lung tumors. 11,12 However, percutaneous ablation has been reported to be associated with complications such as pneumothorax, hemorrhage, and pleural effusions. 7,9,13 An endobronchial approach has been investigated due to its promising potential in having lower complication rates than transthoracic techniques. 6,14,15\nThe crucial issue for the bronchoscopic approach was the precision of the introduction of the ablation instruments into the tumor. Navigation bronchoscopy provided the ability to accurately reach the target tumor. 16 Ablation instruments could be delivered to the lesion through the working channel to achieve ablation with guided technology. 17 Previous animal experiments have shown that bronchoscopic MWA is feasible and safe. 18,19 Lau et al. 20 reported treatment outcomes of three metastatic lung tumors managed with bronchoscopic MWA.\nThis prospective study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of navigation bronchoscopy-guided MWA as a treatment modality for peripherally located early stage or multiple primary lung cancer.",

All procedures were performed using a flexible bronchoscope (BF-1T260, BF-1TQ290, BF-P260F, or BF-P290; Olympus) via a laryngeal mask airway under general anesthesia. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) (LungCare navigation system; LungCare Medical Technologies Ltd.; or superDimension/inReach system; Medtronic) or bronchoscopic transparenchymal nodule access (BTPNA) (Archimedes Virtual Bronchoscopy Navigation System; Broncus Medical) was performed as needed for navigational assistance. 22 -24\nWhen the peripheral catheter reached the lesion with navigational assistance, a radial probe endobronchial ultrasound (R-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)) (UM-S20-20R or UM-S20-17S; Olympus) was inserted from the proximal end of the lesion to its distal end to confirm the position and range of the tumor and its relationship to the instruments via the peripheral catheter. Fluoroscopic images of the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) probe were captured at the proximal and distal end of the tumor as a reference of the MWA antenna.\nA flexible water-cooled MWA antenna (MTC-3CA-II6/ Φ 1.8 mm; Vison-China Medical Devices R&D Center; or KY-2AAP-49H/ Φ 1.9 mm; Canyon Medical Inc.) connected to a microwave platform (Surblate, Vison; or KY-2000, Canyon) was introduced into the tumor through the peripheral catheter using prior fluoroscopic images of the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) probe as guidance.\nThe MWA antenna was inserted into the more distal portion of the tumor for the initial cycle of the ablation and was withdrawn at the proximal portion for more cycles when it was necessary depending on the tumor shape and size. If needed, multiple ablations were performed through different paths to obtain better tumor coverage. Power of 50 to 80 W administered for 3 to 10 min was recommended for each cycle of the ablation. This procedure was in accordance with our previous experience. 19 Fluoroscopy was performed immediately to detect the presence of pneumothorax and any other changes after the treatment. All procedures were performed by the same experienced interventional pulmonologist (J.S.).",

      "content": "A chest CT was performed 24 h after the ablation, if it was not available, within 72 h after the procedure was admitted, to evaluate the patient for the presence of any complications and to assess the effectiveness of the treatment approach.\nPatients underwent contrast-enhanced chest CT scans 1 month after the ablation and every 3 months for the next 2 years thereafter. PET-CT at 3 months post-ablation was done to evaluate the efficacy of the ablation. If the outcome was not satisfactory 3 months after treatment, one more MWA was performed. Follow-up was conducted as mentioned above. All patients were followed-up by the end of August 2021.\nThe ablated lesion is usually the same size or larger compared to the tumor before ablation for the first 3 months even if the tumor is completely ablated. 25 Therefore, the commonly used evaluation criteria for solid tumors were not suitable for the assessment of the local efficacy of MWA. In our study, tumor response was evaluated 3 months post-ablation based on the lesion size, density or hypermetabolism on CT or PETCT. Tumor response was categorized as complete ablation, incomplete ablation, and local progression as reported in previous studies. 7,25,26 The 1 month follow-up CT scan was taken as a term of reference.\nComplete ablation was defined as stability or a decrease in the size of the ablation zone without enhancement and/or hypermetabolism. Incomplete ablation was defined as stability or a decrease in size of the ablation zone and the absence of change or decrease in the enhanced zone and/or the hypermetabolic zone. Local progression was defined as an increase in size of at least 20% of the target lesion, with the smallest diameter of the lesion at any time as the reference or the appearance and/or continuation of central or nodular enhancement >10 mm and/or 15 HU of the tumor or an increase or a new uptake metabolic activity at the site of the previously ablated tumor. 26 Radiological evaluation was carried out by a multidisciplinary team consisting of three physicians from medical oncology, radiology, and nuclear medicine who independently evaluated and reached an agreement on the final evaluation.",

Both patients had a lesion that was close to the pleura or interlobar fissure. The commonly used percutaneous MWA has been reported to have a high incidence rate of complications. 31 Compared with RFA, MWA has been reported to confer a higher risk of persistent air leak, bronchopleural fistula, and infection, with an increased incidence of cavitation, which is probably due to higher ablation temperatures. 11,32 Pneumothorax is the most commonly reported complication in percutaneous ablation, and was seen in /C24 33.9% of patients, of which approximately 11% required chest tube placement, especially in patients with severe emphysema. 33,34 The bronchoscopic approach should not violate the pleural space in order to reduce the occurrence of complications. However, patients with lesions close to the pleura, interlobar fissure, or pulmonary bullous, or with extremely poor lung function still have a high pneumothorax risk for bronchoscopic MWA.\nA bronchoscopic approach has its own unique advantages over a percutaneous approach besides a potential safety profile. Many peripheral lung cancers have a bronchus sign, thereby making the tumor suitable for bronchoscopic ablation. 17 Bronchoscopic approach is not affected by the respiratory motion as the lesion is constrained by the airways and the antenna. Furthermore, the lesion can be diagnosed, staged, and treated in a single procedure via a bronchoscopic approach, thus functioning as a one-stop shop. 9 Patients diagnosed with stage IA lung cancer with bronchus leading to the tumor and located in the inner third lung, having poor pulmonary function, or difficult to access via percutaneous approach, are suitable for bronchoscopic ablation.\nOne of the difficulties in bronchoscopic ablation is reaching the target lesion accurately in a complicated tracheobronchial tree. Another difficulty is the confirmation of the instruments when embedding it within the tumor. We reached the tumor with the guidance of different navigation platforms. R-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) combined with fluoroscopy was then used to confirm the position of the MWA antenna. The optimal device at present to confirm the position is cone beam CT (CBCT) or CT. 15,35 In addition, in order to guarantee the ablation efficacy, we needed to adjust the ablation time, output power, and number of ablation times according to the lesion size and shape. For some tumors, a combination of two or more paths to the lesion were needed in conducting the ablation and in ensuring adequate coverage of the tumor with energy. In some cases, exit from the airways was needed to ensure optimal ablation, such as inserting the ablation instruments into the tumor directly or delivering them into the tumor through a tunnel created via BTPNA approach. 20,23\nThis study has several limitations. Although PET-CT, lymph node staging, and other examinations were performed\nprior to bronchoscopic MWA, it was still possible for patients to be understaged at the time of ablation, which would have affected the PFS data. Second, this procedure required experience and had a steep learning curve, which therefore limited the generalizability of this technique. In our first five cases, the energy and duration of the first ablation session were insufficient; thus, a second session was needed. Our study was also limited by our lack of access to a CBCT or CT scanner during the ablative procedures for real-time confirmation of ablative probe position and instant effect of the ablation. During the ablative procedures in our study, REBUS combined with fluoroscopy was used to monitor the position of the tumor and its relationship to the instruments and the ablation effect. CT scan was performed 24 h after the ablation. Other limitations included the lack of consistency due to the usage of two different MWA catheters. In addition, long-term follow-up is needed to determine the value of ablation of these lesions, especially for ground-glass opacity lesions. Tumors were heterogeneous in our study, but clinical outcomes of different cohorts were not analyzed due to the small sample size.\nIn conclusion, our initial experience indicated that bronchoscopic MWA is feasible with acceptable occurrence of complications for patients with peripheral lung cancer, which may be a promising therapeutic alternative. We continue to accumulate experience in the development of appropriate protocols for the safe and effective treatment. Well-designed comparative clinical studies are needed to prove the clinical benefit of this approach.",
