Percutaneous tracheostomy (PT) is now routinely performed by surgeons and non-surgeons such as intensivists and anesthesiologists in the intensive care units (ICU) all over the world. Although obesity, emergent tracheostomy, coagulopathy, inability to extend the neck and high ventilator demand (HVD) were initially thought to be a relative contraindication, recent data suggest safety of PT in these patient population. Ultrasound can be helpful in limited cases to identify the neck structure especially in patients with a difficult anatomy. Bronchoscopy during PT can shorten the duration and avoid complications. PT has favorable complication rate, lower infection rate, shorter procedural duration and is cost-effective. Experience with the technique and careful planning is needed to minimize any avoidable potential complication.\nKeywords: Percutaneous tracheostomy (PT); obesity; coagulopathy; high positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP); hypotension; complications; suture; training\nand are briefly discussed.\nInitially, the serial dilator technique was introduced where sequentially larger dilators were used to create a stoma (9). Later, instead of serial dilators, a single curved tapering dilator was introduced to dilate the stoma in one single step, which is now most commonly used. In the US, there are two commercially available kits that use a single tapering dilator (Ciaglia Blue Rhino; Cook Medical Inc., Bloomington, Indiana, and Portex UL TRAperc Single Stage Dilator Technique Kit, Smiths Medical Dublin, Ohio). The use of a single dilator has minimized complications associated with serial dilation that were seen at the outset. A technique introduced in 1997 uses a specially designed Griggs forceps to dilate the stoma (10) that is introduced over a guidewire and then extended to dilate the stoma. Another technique was described by Fantoni et al. ,  where after introduction of a guidewire in the anterior tracheal wall, the dilator and the tracheostomy tube are pulled through the larynx in a retrograde fashion (11). In percutwist technique, a screw like dilator is slowly introduced over a guidewire by rotating it clockwise to dilate the stoma (12). A balloon dilation technique was introduced in the US where instead of a tapering dilator, a balloon was introduced over the guidewire to dilate the stoma (13). Once the stoma is dilated, the tracheostomy tube that was loaded proximal to the balloon is then passed over the guidewire.\nIn theory, except in Griggs, Fantoni's and the balloon dilation techniques, all other methods require pressure over the anterior wall during dilation risking a possible posterior tracheal wall injury. However, experience and care with the single dilator technique has made it most popular with minimal risk of complications.",

      "content": "PT is mostly performed in the intensive care unit (ICU) where the patient is already intubated and sedated. However, it can be done anywhere. We prefer to have an airway in place, so the patient can be ventilated during the procedure. In addition to the operator, other personnel required for the procedure include a bronchoscopist and bronchoscopy technician, respiratory therapist to retract and hold the endotracheal tube (ETT) and a nurse to administer medications and monitor patient vitals. Adequate analgesia and sedation is required during the procedure. The anterior neck area is infiltrated with a combination of lidocaine and epinephrine to achieve vasoconstriction along\nwith local anesthesia. Commonly used medications include fentanyl, midazolam, propofol, morphine and a short acting paralytic. However, PT has been reported in awake patient with only local anesthesia (14).\nAfter obtaining informed consent, the patient is placed in a supine position. A rolled up towel is placed under the shoulder to extend the neck, so, the trachea can be easily palpated and the cricoid cartilage is pulled superiorly. This enhances the distance between the sternal notch and the cricoid cartilage allowing easier access to trachea. The tracheal rings are palpated to identify the sternal notch and the cricoid cartilage. Once the landmarks (sternal notch, tracheal rings and cricoid cartilage) are identified, the anterior neck area is cleaned and the surface is covered with sterile drape. If the cricoid cartilage or tracheal rings cannot be palpated, we prefer to avoid the percutaneous technique.\nAfter adequate sedation is achieved, a short-acting paralytic is administered. A bronchoscope is then inserted through the ETT and a quick airway examination is done. The ETT is then slowly retracted under bronchoscopic guidance to the level of the cricoid cartilage after the cuff is  deflated.  We continue to retract the ETT until the cricothyroid membrane is visualized with the bronchoscope to identify the cricoid cartilage. The ETT tip is positioned at the level of the cricoid cartilage and the cuff of the ETT is  then re-inflated. A 1.5-cm vertical incision is made in midline ( Figure 1 ). With help of curved Kelly forceps and blunt dissection the trachea is slowly approached. The 1 st , 2 nd tracheal rings and the cricoid cartilage are identified with indentation from outside and by visualization through the bronchoscope.\nA needle is then inserted in midline through the interspace between the 1 st and 2 nd or  2 nd and 3 rd tracheal rings. Using Seldinger technique, a guidewire is inserted through the needle and the needle is removed. A 14F punch dilator is then inserted over the guidewire and next a curved, tapering dilator is inserted to dilate the stoma. Once the stoma is adequately dilated, tracheostomy tube is loaded onto a straight dilator and then inserted over the guidewire into the trachea. Bronchoscope is then removed from the ETT and inserted through the tracheostomy tube to confirm placement by visualizing the trachea or the carina. The distal end of the tracheostomy tube should be at least 1 inch or more proximal to the main carina.\nTracheostomy tube is then attached to ventilator circuit and a second mode of confirmation is made after an appropriate tidal volume return is detected on the ventilator. The tracheostomy tube is then secured with\nVelcro tracheostomy ties or sutures.",

In patients in the medical ICU, the common indication for tracheostomy is respiratory failure and the need for continued mechanical ventilation (15,16).

A tracheostomy is often done to assist with\nclearance of profuse secretions. ST is preferred when there is malignancy involving the neck or upper airways.",

      "content": "In a cohort of 474 adults with 73 obese patients with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 27.5 kg/m 2 , four different percutaneous techniques were studied. The overall complication rate was 43.8% in the obese group compared to 18.2% in the control group (P<0.001) and obesity was associated with 4.9-fold increased risk for serious complications (18). Another prospective study of PT in 500 ICU patients found that, obese patients with a BMI of 30 kg/m 2 or higher experienced a significantly greater complication rate compared to patients with a BMI of less than 30 kg/m 2 (15% vs. 8%, P<0.05) (19). However, a similar association was also observed in another report of open ST performed in 89 morbidly obese (BMI of ≥ 40 kg/m 2 )  patients from a sample of 427 critically ill patients. Morbid obesity was independently associated with an increased risk (odds ratio 4.4) of tracheostomy-related complications (20).\nOn the other hand, multiple studies showed the safety of PT in obese patients without a higher complication rate (21,22). A retrospective study looking at 143 patients with BMI >35 kg/m 2 who underwent either PT or open ST showed no significant difference in complication rates including malpositioning of tracheostomy tube, loss of airway, or bleeding (21). Bedside PT was safely performed in thirteen obese ICU patients (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m 2 ) who required tracheostomy for failure to wean and procedural complications were limited to paratracheal tracheostomy tube placement in one patient, with immediate identification and appropriate correction (22). We believe that PT can be done safely in obese population with additional skills and experience.",

Available data\nsuggest that the incidence of bleeding is low in patients with coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia undergoing PT (25).\nWe prefer a platelet count of at least 50 k and INR <1.8 prior to performing PT. Heparin drip should be held for at least 4 hours prior to the PT and can be restarted 3 hours postprocedure. Safety of PT on anti-platelet therapy has been demonstrated (26). In patients where clopidogrel cannot be held for 3-5 days (e.g., recent drug eluting stent) we perform PT with appropriate informed consent.",

Patients with average PaO 2 / FiO2 of 130 mmHg and an average PEEP of 17 cmH2O did not suffer any oxygenation deterioration (32).\nFive patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)) on high-frequency oscillatory ventilation had PDT safely performed without any significant hemodynamic or respiratory changes (33).\nIn a retrospective analysis of 177 patients, PT was successfully performed in 14 (8.4%) patients with high ventilator demand (HVD) (PEEP ≥ 10 cmH2O or FiO2 ≥ 70%) compared to non-HVD group without any significant differences in complications like hypoxia (7% vs. 6%), airway loss (14% vs. 4%), air-leak (7% vs. 3%) or para-tracheal placement (0% vs. 1%). However, hypotension (36% vs. 8%; P=0.007) and extra-long tracheostomy tube placement (43% vs. 12%; P=0.006) were significantly higher in the HVD group indicating that there is an interaction of obesity and HVD (24).\nIn our practice, we carefully evaluate patients on high FiO2 or high PEEP prior to PT to assess the overall risk. The shorter duration of PT and the use of bronchoscope through the ETT may actually minimize the loss of PEEP during the procedure. In this population, we usually retract the ETT when the blunt dissection is completed and the tracheal rings are identified by palpation, to minimize loss of PEEP or hypoxia.",

In an international multicenter study involving 412 medical-surgical ICU patients, tracheostomy was performed at a median of 11 days (36) after intubation. The decision is mostly influenced by the patient's overall clinical condition, prognosis and tolerance to wean.\nIn a prospectively randomized study of 120 critically ill medical patients, early PT within 48 hours was associated with significantly lower rate of mortality, pneumonia, accidental extubations and shorter length of stay in the ICU and on mechanical ventilation compared with the prolonged intubation group (37).\nWhile similar findings were reported in reducing the rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia (38), decreased ICU length of stay and number of days spent on mechanical ventilation (38-41); the incidence of pneumonia was not significantly different in other studies with a mix of both ST and PT (40,41).\nA meta-analysis of nine randomized clinical trials with 2,072 participants showed that early tracheostomy had no significant influence on clinical outcomes (shortterm mortality, long-term mortality, length of ICU stay, ventilator-associated pneumonia or duration of mechanical ventilation) compared to late tracheostomy or prolonged intubation (42). Although, two more recent analyses suggest superiority of early tracheostomy (43,44), the timing of tracheostomy is dependent mostly on individual and institutional practice.",

      "title": "Complications of tracheostomy",
      "content": "Bleeding is the most common early complication of tracheostomy and was the major cause of death in one study (45). Minor oozing during placement may be managed by local pressure, light packing with adrenaline or tranexamic acidsoaked gauze packs (46). In case of ongoing bleeding or oozing around the tracheostomy tube after placement, the stoma needs to be explored to locate a bleeding vessel which can then be either cauterized or sutured.\nTracheo-innominate artery fistula is an uncommon (<1%) but fatal complication after tracheostomy (47,48) and can occur after 3-4 weeks after tracheostomy regardless of whether it was ST or PT (48). Tracheo-innominate artery fistula can be prevented by placing the tracheostomy tube in between the first and the second or second and the third tracheal rings. The risk is higher when the tube placement is further lower (49). The treatment is immediate surgical intervention. Direct digital pressure on the anterior wall of\nthe stoma can be a helpful temporary measurement.\nRespiratory secretions and mucus plugs, often occlude the tracheostomy tube cannula (50) in up to 57% of patients (51). Obstruction of the tracheal cannula by hematoma and swollen posterior tracheal wall is also possible (52).\nSubcutaneous emphysema can occur in 1.4% and pneumothorax in 0.8% of cases after tracheostomy (53). However, the highest rate of pneumothorax is reported to be 17% (54). Four deaths resulting from pneumothorax after PT were reported and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) was identified as a risk factor (45). Possible mechanisms for subcutaneous emphysema are malposition of the tracheostomy tube inside the stoma or air leaking into the subcutaneous tissue during ventilation during a difficult procedure. Subcutaneous emphysema can also happen in obese patients during dissection of the anterior neck tissue. Posterior tracheal wall laceration is another potential factor for pneumothorax (53).\nIn a retrospective study of 1,130 consecutive ST, the incidence of tracheostomy tube displacement was 1.5% (46). Tube displacement can be life-threatening immediately following a tracheostomy procedure before the track matures. And the ETT can be inadvertently reinserted paratracheally into a false track. The risk is higher in obese patients where the skin to tracheal distance may be in excess of 2-4 cm, especially if not in expert hands. This can be minimized when skin flaps are sutured to the trachea to form a permanent stoma or stay sutures are used (50). Restricting first tracheostomy tube change after 5-7 days can  also  minimize  paratracheal  insertion.  Use  of  a guiding catheter (Weinmann tracheostomy exchange set, COOK Medical Inc. Bloomington, Indiana, USA) during tracheostomy tube exchange and bronchoscopic guidance can minimize the risk of paratracheal insertion.\nWe routinely place extra-long tracheostomy tubes in obese patients, when skin to trachea distance is greater than 1cm or when the trachea is deep, to avoid malposition of the tracheostomy tube that can lead to cuff leak.\nAt our institution, loss of airway or cuff leak after PT was a common occurrence in the obese population during the first 50 cases. The number reduced significantly once we started to place extra-long tracheostomy tubes in patients with obesity, short neck and deep trachea (55).\nTracheal stenosis is narrowing of the tracheal lumen from fibrosis or granulation tissue formation after intubation or tracheostomy tube placement with an incidence as high as 85% (56). Only 3-12% are clinically important and require further intervention (48). As a rule, symptoms develop when\nthe lumen is <50% of normal. Stomal stenosis may start as bacterial infection and chondritis leading to formation of granulation tissue while stenosis at the cuff level is due to pressure necrosis (48). A-form deformities can develop later when the tracheal cartilage is fractured during placement or if a Bjork flap was created during ST.\nRigid or flexible bronchoscopy with radial resection of the stenotic area with cautery knife, balloon dilation, cryotherapy, mitomycin application are possible treatment options before considering surgical resection (56).\nTracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) is very rare (57). In one review of 1,130 tracheostomies, the incidence of TEF was 0.08% and was universally fatal (46). Injury to the posterior tracheal wall during stoma creation, during intubation or erosion of the tracheostomy cuff through the posterior tracheal wall due to excessive cuff pressures (54) are potential risk factors for TEF.\nStomal infection can occur at any time after tracheostomy placement, as the tracheal secretions can easily contaminate the wound. In chronic tracheostomy, pressure of the tube flange or swivel adapter edge against the sternum and poor tracheostomy tube care can make it worse. There is evidence that stomal infection occurs less frequently in patients with PT (58). It is also possible that the majority of MICU patients who undergo PT are already on antibiotic.\nOverall, evidence suggests that in critically ill patients, elective tracheostomy can be carried out with acceptable perioperative risk profile (59).

There was no difference in overall operative complication rates or mortality between ST and PT (61).\nSeventeen RCTs involving 1,212 patients in a metaanalysis comparing PT to ST found that PT has lower risk of wound infection, bleeding and mortality when compared with ST (62).\nOverall, PT in well-trained hands is a procedure with excellent safety records in variety of patients with\nmany of the aforementioned contraindications (63,64). Bronchoscopy guided PT is a safe procedure when performed by a team of experienced operators in a controlled environment with less than 3% risk of significant complications (52).\nIn a prospective randomized study comparing PT and ST in critically ill patients, the cost of PT was found to be significantly lower (US$ 1,569±157 vs. US$ 3,172±114; P<0.0001), the duration of PT was significantly shorter (20 vs. 42 mins; P<0.0001) and there was no significant difference in the number of days intubated prior to tracheostomy or overall ICU and hospital length of stay compared to ST (65).\nA meta-analysis of 22 studies comparing PT and ST found no significant differences in mortality and intraoperative or post-operative bleeding risk. There was a significantly lower rate of infection (pooled odds ratio 0.20 P ≤ 0.0001) and shorter procedure time (pooled OR -1 .7 to 0.7, P ≤ 0.001) with PT compared to ST (66).\nAnother study of 61 ICU patients who underwent bronchoscopy guided PT reported one procedure-related death due to arrhythmia (67).

Bedside ultrasound screening allows for easy identification of  pretracheal  vascular  structures  that  might  pose  a hemorrhage risk during PT (71). In addition, it can also provide an estimate of skin to trachea distance, especially in obese population.\nPortable ultrasound before PT to identify the tracheal rings, thyroid isthmus, neighboring blood vessels may help provide a safe location for needle insertion (72). A randomized prospective study of 47 patients found that realtime ultrasound guidance can significantly improve the rate of first -pass puncture and puncture accuracy (73).\nHowever, posterior tracheal wall cannot be visualized with ultrasound due to the tissue to air interface and posterior wall damage during dilatational PT cannot be assessed with ultrasound. Moreover, routine use of real time ultrasound can be cumbersome especially in the small operating field of tracheostomy.",

The mean operating time was 3.05 minutes, and there were no deaths or life threatening complications.\nThere was no significant difference in complication rate or procedural duration when ultrasound guided PDT is compared to bronchoscopy guided PDT in a prospective randomized trial of 118 patients (76).",

      "content": "Tracheostomy tube displacement may lead to potentially serious complications and loss of airway. Fixation of the tracheostomy tube to the skin with a suture can potentially minimize accidental decannulation in PT (77). However, one needs to remember that skin is very mobile, especially in obese patients. The distal end of a regular tracheostomy tube may be dislodged inside the tracheostomy stoma\nTEF, tracheoesophageal fistula.\nleading to cuff leak or subcutaneous emphysema, while the tracheostomy flange may still be sutured to the skin. In one large series of 1,175 tracheotomies, accidental decannulation was not found to be associated with suture placement. Moreover, accidental decannulation occurred in  patients  while  the  suture  was  still  in  place  (78).  A tracheostomy tie is the most important factor in holding the tracheostomy tube in place. The same study found that use of outer flange security sutures to anchor the tracheostomy tube was associated with lower incidence of postoperative bleeding (78).\nIn our practice, we do not place any sutures during PT, and use a Velcro tracheostomy tie. The tracheostomy tie is  applied in such way, that it is tight and snug but still permits a finger breadth of slack around the neck . Prior to implementing a no suture policy, it is important to educate and train the nursing stuff and other caretakers to prevent any accidental decannulation.\nThe application of stay suture (placement of sutures between the anterior tracheal wall and the skin to hasten the formation of a mature stoma) was evaluated in 104 patients prospectively and compared to 101 conventional tracheostomy patients. The most common complication in each group was postoperative stoma infection. Unexpected decannulation occurred in three patients in the conventional tracheostomy group, while none occurred in the stay suture group (79).",

Perioperative and late complication rates were significantly reduced after the first  20  patients.  Practice  on  mannequins  or  animal model during initial training can improve the skills and minimize complications. A study of emergency medicine residents on cricothyroidotomy found that training on live anesthetized animals improve procedural competency and performance (81). The technique of PT can be acquired after 5-10 procedures; however, supervised experience with at least 20 procedures is needed to become familiar with common difficulties, potential complications and risks. In a multicenter study of tracheostomies, surgeons with fewest tracheostomies were found to have highest complication rates (78). We recommend that, the high risk cases or patients with relative contraindication be attempted only after experience with a total of 50-100 PTs.",

Primary operator is notified of any bleeding or cuff-leak in the immediate post-operative period, in case the tracheostomy stoma needs to be explored or the tracheostomy tube needs to be replaced. Most medical ICU patients are usually transferred to a ventilator weaning facility, where experienced physicians or respiratory therapists manage ventilator weaning and provide care of the tracheostomy.\nA patient may be weaned off from a ventilator but may still need long term tracheostomy for secretion clearance, upper airway obstruction or neck surgery. The patient or the caretaker should be educated on how to clean and care for the tracheostomy tube and suctioning prior to discharging the patient. Disposable inner-cannula can be an alternative to regular cleaning. A heat and moisture exchange (HME) filter maintains moisture of the airways and prevent formation of mucus plug. Regular follow up with respiratory or speech therapist or other health care provider experienced in managing long term tracheostomy ensures proper maintenance. Although optimum interval is unknown, tracheostomy tube change by an experienced provider every 2-3 months is a good practice.",

      "content": "The process of decannulation depends on institutional protocol and practice. Once a patient is weaned from mechanical ventilation, has strong cough and is able to clear secretions; the process of decannulation is beguan. The tracheostomy tube is downsized to a smaller caliber tube to allow increased trans-laryngeal airflow and thus improve speech. At this point, patients may be able to speak by blocking the tracheostomy tube opening with a finger or with the help of a one-way speaking valve. Often, a fenestrated or cuff less tracheostomy tube is used to permit additional airflow .\nOnce the patient is able to tolerate the speaking valve, the next step is to cap the tracheostomy tube, which forces to inhale and exhale through the upper airways instead of the tracheostomy tube, essentially preparing the patient for decannulation. If the patient is able to tolerate capping of the tracheostomy tube for more than 48-72 hours, the tracheostomy tube can be removed. A bronchoscopic examination is indicated if the patient in unable to tolerate capping to rule out any stenosis or granulation tissue formation.",

A large worldwide tracheostomy database will be able to provide an accurate information on the cost, risk and complications of various techniques of tracheostomy in different patient population.",
