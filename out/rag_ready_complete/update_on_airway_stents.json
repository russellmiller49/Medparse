      "title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "content": "Central airway obstruction (CAO) is defined as narrowing of the trachea, main stem bronchi, or the bronchus intermedius [1]. Some definitions have included the lobar bronchi as well [2]. Benign causes include postintubation or post-tracheostomy tracheal stenosis, lung transplant-related strictures, and autoimmune processes (e.g. granulomatosis with polyangiitis) [3 && ]. Malignant causes include both primary lung cancers and disease metastatic to the lung.\nApproximately 80000 cases of malignant CAO occur in the United States each year, with one-third of nonsmall cell lung cancers initially presenting with CAO [1]. Airway metastasis from nonlung cancers is not uncommon either. Those cancers with the greatest predilection for the airways include cancers of the digestive tract, breast cancer, and renal cell carcinoma [1].\nVarious therapeutic modalities are available for CAO, including surgery, different ablative techniques, and tools for mechanical debulking. Airway stenting is usually reserved for cases in which these techniques alone are inadequate and requires careful patient and stent selection in addition to procedural expertise and awareness of potential complications. This article will review the recent literature on airway\nstents for malignant CAO. Stenting for CAO in benign disease has been covered elsewhere [3 && ].",

      "title": "INDICATIONS AND PATIENT SELECTION",
      "content": "There are two broad categories of indications for stents. One is obstruction of the airway lumen. Masses outside of the airway can cause extrinsic compression. Masses can also reside inside the lumen, causing intrinsic obstruction. A mixed pattern of both can also occur. Additionally, loss of airway wall strength, such as in tracheobronchomalacia, can lead to airway collapse and obstruction of the lumen. Pure extrinsic compression and wall collapse are treated with stenting if severe enough. Pure intrinsic obstruction can often be dealt with by endoluminal ablative and debulking approaches\nDepartment of Pulmonary Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA\nCorrespondence to David E.

Mixed patterns of disease often require multiple modalities of intervention.\nA second indication is due to a defect in the airway wall. Broncho-esophageal fistulae or anastomotic dehiscence after lung transplantation can leave significant breaches in the airway wall. This can then lead to even more complications downstream. These disease states can potentially be treated with stenting.\nAvariety of airway stents are commercially available. They are broadly categorized based on their composition - silicone or metal. Within these categories, there are subtle but important differences that can have clinical implications (Fig. 1). No one stent is suitable for all conditions; each has its advantages and disadvantages.\nSeveral factors must be considered together to determine if and when to proceed with stent placement. One is whether the observed airway disease is significant enough to explain the patient's symptoms. Generally, central airway size must be reduced by approximately 50% before symptoms will arise [1]. Reduction in tracheal lumen diameter to approximately 8mm will often produce dyspnea on exertion; lumen size of 5 mm or less usually leads to dyspnea at rest [1]. If a lesion is physiologically significant enough to cause burdensome dyspnea, intervention should be considered.\nAlternatively, an airway lesion may be present without causing sufficient obstruction to cause a patient's dyspnea (or it may be only a minor cause). In this case, observation alone may be warranted. An important caveat to keep in mind, however, is whether postponing an intervention would lead to a more difficult or riskier procedure later. If other\ninterventions that address the malignant CAO are either not feasible or not timely in terms of their effect on dyspnea (e.g. chemotherapy for lymphoma), then timely bronchoscopic intervention before the patient is in extremis should be considered. A recent study demonstrated that urgent and emergent therapeutic bronchoscopy is associated with higher rates of complications than elective procedures [4].\nSeveral other factors must also be considered when contemplating stent placement. Although immediate complications are relatively rare after therapeutic bronchoscopy, long-term complications are not. These include infection, formation of granulation tissue, and stent migration - any of which may require repeat bronchoscopy in already debilitated patients (see below for a detailed description of complications based on recent data). Similar consideration must also be given to the fact that stent placement often requires general anesthesia. Importantly, patients with malignant CAO have limited life expectancy and may have specific goals of care that need to be heeded. This is not to suggest that stent placement is a poor choice in someone with a poor prognosis. There can be a definite palliative benefit of stents for dyspneic patients with malignant CAO at the end of life [5]. Finally, from a technical standpoint, there must be patent airways distal to the area of obstruction for stent placement to be successful; if distal patency is not present, stenting will be of no benefit. This can be determined by preprocedural imaging in some circumstances, although often this cannot be known with certainty until the time of bronchoscopy. All of these factors must be considered to make an individualized decision for each patient.\nRecent data are available to help inform the patient selection process [2]. Via the multicenter American College of Chest Physicians Quality Improvement Registry, Evaluation, and Education (AQuIRE) registry, Ost et al. appraised 1115 therapeutic bronchoscopy procedures in 947 patients with malignant central airway obstruction at 15 centers. One-third of these cases included stent placement. Technical success, defined as having airway patency restored, was achieved in 93% of patients. Stenting was associated with the highest rates of successful restoration of airway patency. Interestingly, those patients with higher baseline dyspnea (Borg score) and nonlobar obstruction had greater improvements in dyspnea and healthrelated quality of life after therapeutic bronchoscopy. Moreover, patients with higher American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score and poorer functional status also had greater improvements in health-related quality of life. Hence, the patients",

      "title": "COMPLICATIONS",
      "content": "Anotherrecentadvancementhasbeeninunderstandingthecomplicationsoftherapeuticbronchoscopyin malignant central airway obstruction, including stenting, and associated risk factors. A large, multicenter study, also based on the AQuiRE registry, examined the incidence of complications of 1115 procedures performed in 947 patients at 15 centers [4]. CAOwasdefinedasatleast50%obstructionofthe trachea, main stem bronchi, bronchus intermedius, or lobar bronchus. Thirty-six per cent of the 947 patients had any stent placed. Over twice as many metal stents were placed as silicone stents. Overall, there was only a 3.9% short-term complication rate, with a range across centers of 0.9-11.7%. Six patients (0.5%) died due to procedural complications. Risk factors for complications included urgent and emergent procedures, ASA score above 3, redo therapeutic bronchoscopy, and moderate sedation. Unexpected escalation of care occurred in 4.4% of patients, with 1.3% developing unexpected respiratory failure and 0.5% having bleeding requiring intervention. Of note, none of these events were associated with stent placement. Death within 30 days of procedure was associated with stent placement, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score above 1, ASA above 3, andintrinsic or mixed obstruction. Withregard tothe association with stent placement, this could be due to the confounding effect of a greater burden of disease, leading to both the need for a stent, and also worse survival. Stents may also have been used in patients who had exhausted all other alternatives due to disease progression. Nonetheless, the authors suggested judicious use of stents.\nIn a relatively recent retrospective analysis measuring incidence rates for respiratory infection in patients with airway stents for malignant CAO, Grosu et al. [6] showed that stent placement, preprocedural obstruction at least 50%, and male sex were associated with development of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Seventy-two patients\nwith malignant central airway obstruction were included, 24 of whom underwent stent placement. Stent placement and male sex remained as predictors in the multivariate analysis. The incidence rate of LRTI in stented patients was 0.0057 infections per person-day; in nonstented patients, the rate was 0.0011 infections per person-day, giving a statistically significant incidence rate risk difference of 0.0046 infections per day. This corresponds to a 13% increased risk of LRTI per month in stented patients compared with those without stents. In turn, this is equal to one infection for every eight stents placed. Moreover, ECOG at least 2, stenting, and LRTI were associated with decreased survival. However, only LRTI remained associated with survival in the multivariate model. Taken together, given the incidence rate of stent infections and the association of LRTI with death, the emphasis on carefully deciding when to place a stent cannot be overstated.\nAnother relevant study was a retrospective analysis of complications in patients who received airway stents for malignant CAO at a large referral cancer center over a 5.5-year period [7]. One hundred and seventy-two patients underwent 195 stent procedures. Ultraflex metal stents were used in 118 cases (61%), AERO metal stents in 31 (16%), and Dumon silicone stents (both straight and Y-shaped) in 46 (24%). Overall, the most common complications were infection, migration, granulation tissue formation, and mucus plugging. The median time to infection was 1 month; AERO stents seemed to confer an increased risk of infection compared with other stents. Twenty-three per cent of patients with respiratory infection died within 14 days of the infection. For stent migration, the median time to event was 1.4 months. Silicone tube stents had an increased risk of migration compared with metal stents [hazard ratio 3.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.41-8.82, P ¼ 0.007]. Y-stents were not included in this specific analysis as these tend to not migrate because the bronchial limbs hold them in place. The median time to granulation tissue was also 1.4 months. Silicone stents and LRTIs were associated with an increased risk of granulation in the multivariate analysis. Mucus plugging occurred at a median of 1.3 months. Silicone and left-sided stents were associated with increased risk, whereas poststent chemotherapy seemed protective. Tumor overgrowth, hemoptysis, fistula formation, and stent fracture were less common and were not associated with any particular stent type. It is interesting and worth remembering that time to any of the complications listed above was approximately 11.4 months. This could help guide when and how frequently to have patients follow-up after their\nprocedure to monitor for said complications. In terms of overall survival, silicone stents and tracheal stents were associated with decreased mortality, whereas LRTI and prestent radiation therapy were associated with the converse. Possibly, there was some degree of selection bias associated with silicone stent placement, as these may have been placed in healthier patients who are thereby better able to tolerate the more technically difficult placement of these stents compared with metal stents. Silicone stents are also easier to remove. There may have been a bias toward placing these in patients whose disease burden was expected to improve, thereby allowing stent removal later.\nThe past few years have seen helpful advancements in our understanding of airway stent complications and therapeutic bronchoscopy for malignant CAO. The data can be used to inform clinical decision-making and help to quantify some of the risks associated with airway stents.",

      "content": "Three-dimensional printing of stents allows stents to be tailored to an individual's airway anatomy more so than currently available techniques that can customize stents only to a crude, approximate degree. Currently, at the time of bronchoscopy, stents can be cut shorter or have a hole cut to allow ventilation of a side airway. Stents can also be ordered with more specific angles, widths, and lengths, but these usually take several weeks to manufacture and deliver. A 3D printed stent could theoretically be prepared in days or even hours after an airway problem has presented itself and be designed to fit an individual patient's irregular anatomy [8 & ].\nThere have been recent reports of success in these endeavors in humans. Guibert et al. [9] demonstrated placement of a 3D printed stent into a narrowed and tortuous post-transplant airway that could not be relieved by a traditional stent. The patient noted immediate improvement in dyspnea, quality of life, and lung function. Cheng et al. [10] designed and placed a 3D printed Montgomery T tube into a patient with a similarly complex tracheal anastomotic dehiscence. This tube was much better seated compared with his prior tracheostomy; this likely is the main reason that he was without\ngranulation tissue or mucus plugging many weeks after discharge. Additionally, while not taking an endoluminal approach, Morrison et al. [11] created 3D airway splints that were surgically placed around main stem bronchi in three infants with tracheobronchomalacia. Two were eventually able to be liberated from mechanical ventilation completely. A feasibility study is currently under way to test this approach in a series of patients [12].\nThe area of research is still in its infancy but has potential as the field of 3D printing continues to develop. Freitag et al. [8 & ] and Cheng et al. [13 & ] have each recently published very thorough reviews of the process of 3-D printing for the airways.",

      "title": "Drug-eluting stents",
      "content": "The concept of drug-eluting stents for the airway has gained attention because patients with malignant CAO often have exhausted their candidacy for further radiation or cannot tolerate the systemic effects of traditional chemotherapy. Along with the mechanical benefit of the stent itself, sustained release of a cytotoxic drug would provide insitu therapy.\nThe area of research is still in its early stages, but studies in animals have shown some promising results. Recently, Wang et al. [14] randomly assigned eight beagles to receive a bare metal stent or a paclitaxel-eluting stent into the trachea. The dogs were sacrificed at intervals over a course of 5 months. Paclitaxel-treated beagles showed much less granulation tissue than did control dogs, with continued release of the drug into the stented area and the adjacent area. Very low levels of drug were detected elsewhere in the lung, with none detectable in the blood.\nOther drug-eluting airway stents have been studied in animal models. Cisplatin-eluting stents were studied in rabbits, with 15 stents inserted into the trachea with a measurable, steady release of the drug over several weeks [15]. Serum levels remained low throughout the observation period, and there were only mild mucosal changes on gross examination. Zhu et al. [16] placed tracheal stents eluting the antimitotic drug mitomycin into rabbits and compared these with nonmitomycin stents and nonstented controls. Mitomycin-treated rabbits had the least granulation formation and mucus trapping at 12 weeks compared with the other groups.\nVarious other drugs have been considered for stents, including pirfenidone, which recently was shown to trigger airway fibroblast apoptosis and to reduce cell viability; other agents being studied are those that are currently used in coronary artery drug-eluting stents such as sirolimus and everolimus\n[17-19]. Interestingly, not only drugs but genetic material can be transferred via stents. As a proof of concept, Kruklitis et al. [20] transfected reporter and therapeutic genes from an adenoviral vector on a tracheal stent to tracheal mucosa in a rat tumor model. The treated rats showed reduced growth of tracheal tumor, and also a trend toward improved survival.",

      "title": "Biodegradable stents",
      "content": "Biodegradable stents have been successfully used in the urology, gastrointestinal, and cardiology realms. The idea of their use for malignant CAO has appeal, because, given that the goal is palliation, it would allow one to avoid a second procedure for stent removal. Moreover, because these stents do not remain in the airway for a prolonged time, one might theoretically also reduce the rate of late complications (e.g. granulation tissue, infection).\nTo date, only five studies in humans have been conducted, with mixed results. None of these has been in the setting of malignant CAO. The largest was by Lischke et al. [21], who described a series of 20 stents made of bioresorbable polydioxanone placed in six patients with postlung transplant bronchial stenosis. Stenosis was relieved in all patients, although symptomatic changes were not reported. There were no immediate complications. Four patients ultimately needed restenting due to restenosis at a median time of 5 months. One died of pulmonary embolism; the other five were doing well at 4 years of follow-up with a median interventionfree time of 24 months. Fuehner et al. [22] described a similar series of 10 patients with post-transplant stenosis. Eleven stents were placed, also made of polydioxanone (although several biodegradable polymer options are available). All patients had symptom relief and improvements in lung function and 6-min walk distance. One patient required stent removal at 4 days due to bleeding, and four patients developed in-stent restenosis. However, by 6 months, no patient needed further interventions. Stents were completely degraded by a median of 141 days. Of note, the aforementioned drug-eluting stents developed by Chao et al. [15] and Zhu et al. [16] were biodegradable as well. Further experience is clearly needed, but biodegradable stents may be a viable tool in our armamentarium in the future.",

      "title": "Mini stents",
      "content": "In the past year, there has been increasing attention in the literature to lobar stents - also called 'mini stents.' The rationale is that improving patency could potentially prevent a lobar pneumonia that\ncould lead to sepsis and/or respiratory failure in already debilitated and immunocompromised patients. Additionally, in lung cancer patients after lung resection, losing a single lobe would be losing a larger percentage of gas exchange area than if they had two full lungs. This same reasoning can be applied for single lung transplant patients who are living with a single functional lung. Therefore, preserving function of a single lobe may be quite beneficial.\nSethi et al. recently presented a fairly large series of outcomeswiththeiCASTstent(AtriumMedical,Hudson, New Hampshire, USA) [23]. This is a balloonexpandable, fully covered metallic stent that has been used frequently in the treatment of vascular occlusive disease, but approved recently by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the airway. One hundred and twenty-two stents were placed in 38 patients, half of whom had malignant lobar airway obstruction.Ninety-fivepercentofpatientshadsymptomatic improvement based on questioning during follow-up.Fifteenof16patientswithpulmonaryfunction testing before and after stent placement had an average increase of 12.3% in forced expiratory volume in 1 second. Overall, complications occurred in 20%, and included migration (10%), granulation tissue formation (5%), deployment malfunction (2%), and stent dislodgement immediately after deployment (2%). Of note, no infections were detected, and the authors theorized that this was due to the small size of the stent, thereby minimizing impairment of mucociliary clearance and expectoration.\nMajid et al. [24] reported on a series of 21 small stents placed in 18 patients. These investigators also used the Atrium iCAST stent. Ninety-five per cent of stents were placed in lobar airways; 72% of patients had malignant stenosis. There was a statistically significant improvement in dyspnea as measured by modified Medical Research Council score, from a median of 3 to 2 after stent placement. Complications included migration (9.5%), granulation tissue (9.5%), mucus plugging (4.8%), and stent crush (4.8%); five stents had to be removed due to complications. Seven stents were removed with patency maintained over a median of 170 days, but how many of these were for malignant versus benign disease was not specified.\nFinally, Fruchter et al. [25] described a series of 14 patients status post lobar stent, 4 of which were for cancer and 10 for a variety of nonmalignant diseases. Stents used were the SMART nitinol stent (Cordis, Miami, Florida, USA) or Palmaz stent (Johnson & Johnson,NewBrunswick,NewJersey,USA;andInterventional Systems, Warren, New Jersey, USA). There werenoimmediatecomplications.Thirteenofthe14 had improved symptoms (e.g. cough, dyspnea,\nquality of life). Only two patients needed unscheduled bronchoscopy for retained secretions. The rest had scheduled bronchoscopy to remove granulation tissue and secretions. One patient had postobstructive PNA due to granulation tissue.\nOther smaller series have been recently reported as well [26,27].
