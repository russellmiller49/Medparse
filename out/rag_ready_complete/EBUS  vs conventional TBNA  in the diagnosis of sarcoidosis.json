Conventional TBNA (cTBNA) has been used for this purpose for . 30 years and has shown variable success. 1,2  Th e advent of endobronchial ultrasonography to guide TBNA in the early 1990s and availability of real-time convex probe endobronchial ultrasound (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS))-guided TBNA (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA) have revolutionized the use of TBNA in the last decade. 3,4  Th e seemingly obvious advantage of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA for sampling intrathoracic lymph nodes with real-time imaging confi  rming the needle positioned within the lymph node has generated debates on the usefulness of cTBNA in the current scenario. 5,6  Th e superiority of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA over cTBNA in staging of lung cancer has been established. 7,8  Th ere are, however, insuffi cient data to make a comparison between cTBNA and Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA in other conditions.  6\nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA has been used for obtaining tissue confirmation in sarcoidosis. 9,10  In a meta-analysis of the use of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA in sarcoidosis, the pooled sensitivity of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA was 78%.  11  A subsequent large",

Chest radiographs were used to classify the stage of sarcoidosis. 14  CT scan of the chest was used for evaluation of intrathoracic lymph node stations and size and assessment of parenchymal abnormalities.\nAll bronchoscopy procedures were performed by experienced faculty or by fellows under direct supervision on an outpatient basis in a dedicated bronchoscopy suite. Nebulized 4% lignocaine (2.5 mL), 0.6 mg atropine, and 25 mg promethazine IM were used as premedication. Topical  2%  lignocaine  jelly  was  applied  into  the  nasal  cavity,  and 2% lignocaine was instilled over the vocal cords and the airways. No addi  tional sedation was used in the cTBNA group; IV midazolam and pentazocine were used in the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA group. Both procedures were performed without the use of endotracheal intubation or laryngeal airway.\nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA (at least three passes per node) was performed in the supine position transorally using the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscope (BF-UC180F; Olympus Corp) and a dedicated ultrasound image processor (model EU-ME1; Olympus Corp).  Lymph  node  sizes  were  recorded  both in long and short axis (in millimeters). All TBNA specimens were obtained  using  a  dedicated,  disposable,  21-gauge  needle  (Vizishot, NA-201 SX-4021A; Olympus Corp) from the right paratracheal and subcarinal lymph nodes in all subjects. Conventional bronchoscopy was performed in the supine position by transnasal (or oral) route using a video bronchoscope (1T150; Olympus Corp). Any endobronchial mucosal changes in the bronchial tree were recorded. cTBNA (at least three passes per node) was performed using a 21-gauge needle (Smooth Shot, NA-401D 1321; Olympus Corp) from the right paratracheal and subcarinal lymph nodes. Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) was not used in either arm of the study.\nPatients in both arms further underwent EBB and TBLB.

Finally, 130 patients were randomized to either the cTBNA (68 patients) or the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA group (62 patients). A final diagnosis of sarcoidosis was established in 117 patients (62 cTBNA, 55 Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA) groups. Of these, granulomatous inflammation could be demonstrated in 104 patients, and sarcoidosis was diagnosed in 13 (nine in cTBNA and four in Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA groups) on clinical grounds (eight responded to steroid treatment, and five had spontaneous resolution with no alternative diagnosis on follow-up). Disorders other than sarcoidosis were diagnosed in 13 patients (12 TB, one carcinoma) (  Fig 1  ).\nTh e baseline characteristics were similar in the two groups (  Table 1  ). Th e mean age was 43.4 (range, 18-68) years, and 60% were women. Seven patients (5.4%) were asymptomatic, 21 (16.2%) had only pulmonary symptoms, 34 (26.2%) presented with extrapulmonary symptoms, and 68 (52.3%) had both pulmonary and extrapulmonary symptoms. Cough and dyspnea were the predominant pulmonary symptoms. Fever, weight loss, and fatigue were the most common extrapulmonary symptoms. Common extrathoracic organs involved were joints, eyes, and skin. Spirometry was available in 122 subjects and was normal in the majority (58.8%). Tuberculin skin test result was negative ( , 10 mm) in 87.7% of the study subjects and was negative in 96.5% in those fi  nally confi  rmed to have sarcoidosis. Radiologically, stage I disease was seen in 76.9% (75% and 79% in the cTBNA and Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA arms, respectively) of patients on chest radiograph  , whereas 56.2% of patients (58.9% in cTBNA group and 53.2% in Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA\ngroup) had pulmonary infi  ltrates on high-resolution CT scans. Th e mean short-axis diameter of the paratracheal (station 4R) nodes was the same in the two groups (19.8 mm), whereas subcarinal (station 7) nodes were marginally bigger in the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA group compared with the cTBNA group (20.8 ± 5.9 mm vs 19.2 ± 6.9 mm, P 5 .05).\nBronchoscopy was normal in the majority, and mucosal abnormalities (diff  use or focal granularity) were seen in 25.4% patients (27.9% in the cTBNA group and 22.6% in the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA group). Besides TBNA, EBB and TBLB were performed in 121 patients. Among the patients in whom sarcoidosis was fi  nally diagnosed (n 5 117), EBB was not available in six patients (four in cTBNA and two in Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA arms, respectively), and TBLB was not available in fi  ve patients (two in cTBNA and three in Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA arms, respectively).\nThe primary outcome (ie, demonstration of granulomatous inflammation on any of the three sampling procedures) was achieved in 104 patients (88.9%). Diagnostic yield in the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA group was numerically higher than the cTBNA group (92.7% vs 85.5%), but this difference was not significant statistically ( P 5 .34).

Combining EBB or TBLB with TBNA in either group increased the diagnostic yields of TBNA to the point that the superiority of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA over cTBNA was no longer significant (  Table 2  ).

Furthermore, we also are of the opinion that it is extremely rare to fi  nd lymphoma among the patients presenting with typical signs and symptoms of stage I sarcoidosis. 16,17\nEndobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA has enriched the diagnostic armamentarium by enabling sampling of mediastinal lymph nodes under direct visualization. Besides being extensively studied for lung cancer staging, its effi cacy and safety in obtaining tissue diagnosis in sarcoidosis has also been reported. 7,11  However, only a few studies have compared the performance of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA with other conventional bronchoscopy procedures (  Table 4  ). 12,24-29 Most of these studies have been observational, few have analyzed cumulative yields of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA with other procedures, and no study, to our knowledge, has looked at the cumulative yields of all the three procedures in a randomized fashion.\nIn a small prospective study, Oki et al 24  performed cTBNA from the puncture site visible aft  er EBUSTBNA and found similar yield (93%) with the two procedures and a cumulative yield of 100%. In another observational study in which conventional bronchoscopy was performed aft  er Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, it was shown that Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA had a diagnostic sensitivity of 82%, which could be increased to 93% if results of TBLB and EBB were combined with Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) results.  25  However, cTBNA was not part of this study, and the yield of TBLB was much lower (31%) than that reported in the literature ( . 60%). 30,31 Plit et al 28  found no diff  erence between the diagnostic accuracy of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA and TBLB (84% vs 78%, P 5 .77), and together the two procedures could diagnose disease in all the 37 patients studied retrospectively. In two separate studies, Nakajima et al 26  and Oki et al  29  performed TBLB following Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA in 35 and 62 patients, respectively, and found Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and TBLB to have a sensitivity of 63% and 31%, and 94% and 37%, respectively; however, the cumulative yield was not reported.\nTwo RCTs have compared Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA with conventional bronchoscopy. Tremblay et al 27  reported 83% yield with Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA compared with 54% with cTBNA. About 50% of the study population also underwent EBB or TBLB, and, interestingly, the cumulative yield of all bronchoscopic samples was 81% in cTBNA compared with 92% in Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA arm, which was not statistically diff  erent. 27  Th e study was\nlimited by the small sample size (50 patients), and TBLB and EBB were not performed in all the subjects. Subsequently, another larger RCT (Granuloma Trial) has also shown that Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) or endoscopic ultrasoundguided mediastinal lymph node sampling could detect granulomas in higher proportion of patients (74%) compared with conventional TBLB and EBB (48%).  12 However, the study did not combine TBLB and/or EBB to TBNA, and cTBNA was not performed in the conventional bronchoscopy arm, which should be considered a major limitation of the study. 32,33  Besides, the authors relied more on endoscopic ultrasound than Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS): Th e former is seldom performed by the pulmonologists around the world.  21  We have compared EBUSTBNA head-to-head with cTBNA using the same gauge needles (21 gauge) in both arms, and TBLB/EBB was performed in nearly all the patients. An adequate number of nodal passes and biopsies were performed. Our diagnostic yields of individual procedures (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), cTBNA, TBLB, and EBB) are similar to the diagnostic yields accepted for these procedures, and the overall combined yields are also comparable to the best reported.\nPrior to the availability of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), cTBNA and TBLB have been the procedures of choice for diagnosis of sarcoidosis. However, they have been mired with fears of poor yield and complications. 34,35  We observed only one minor pneumothorax in 121 patients who underwent TBLB, and this has been our experience in the past also, wherein we have encountered this problem in , 1% of patients, 31  even though rates up to 4% are described in the literature. 35  In a recent meta-analysis, we found acceptable diagnostic yield (62%) of conventional TBNA in sarcoidosis with practically no complications reported in . 900 patients. 36  Also, the cumulative yield of TBNA and TBLB was 83%,  36  a result replicated in the present study.\nFinally, our study is not without limitations. We chose only lymph nodes in the right paratracheal and subcarinal locations and only those that were . 10 mm in size. Th is could have excluded patients with smaller nodes and diffi cult stations, where Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) would presumably be better than cTBNA. However, this was a pragmatic RCT, wherein our aim was to be close to the real-world situation in sarcoidosis, where lymph nodes are bulky and most oft  en located in these two stations. Th   is is also supported by the fact that only four out of 168 patients (2.3%) screened were excluded due to the small size of nodes. We also did not use ROSE in our diagnostic protocol. Although ROSE does not increase\nthe sensitivity of TBNA, 11  it does reduce the incidence of complications, since it reduces the number of passes. 22  In the specifi  c context of our study, a positive ROSE aft  er TBNA could have enabled us to avoid TBLB, reducing time and the related risks. Finally, although the sample size was calculated a priori, the presumed diff  erence in the diagnostic yield of 20% between the two study arms was not seen. Th erefore, the results may need to be verifi  ed in a larger, preferably multicenter trial.\nWhat are the clinical implications of this study? EBUSTBNA is undoubtedly the single best procedure to obtain histopathological proof in sarcoidosis, but it needs to be combined with TBLB for the best diagnostic yield. Also, if Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA is not available, cTBNA (with EBB and TBLB) may be used with equal effi cacy. Th us, nonavailability of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) should not belittle the pulmonologists seeking to diagnose sarcoidosis; as aptly said by Trisolini et al, 37  'While waiting to buy a Ferrari, do not leave your current car in the garage!'",
