      "content": "In the United States, 1.5 million people are diagnosed with a pleural effusion annually, of whom 175,000 undergo thoracentesis 1-5 . The use of ultrasound-guided thoracentesis has become standard practice, increasing procedural safety and efficiency 6-10 .   Thoracentesis is commonly performed after a pre-procedural ultrasound examination of the pleural space, followed by a post-thoracentesis chest radiograph (CXR) to assess the extent of post-drainage lung reexpansion and residual fluid, underlying parenchymal abnormalities, and evaluation for postprocedural complications such as pneumothorax.\nAfter thoracentesis, clinicians typically follow the standard practice of acquiring a postprocedural CXR either in the Radiology Department or with a portable CXR. This additional step in the clinical workflow could lead to extended travel times between different departments, causing delays in discharge and in the recognition of post-procedural complications, as well as, albeit small, increase in radiation exposure. Moreover, CXR may not be the most informative or practical approach for evaluating the ipsilateral lung post-drainage.\nLung apposition at the edges of posterior-anterior (PA) and lateral CXRs has been used as a radiological marker for both successful pleural space evacuation, and predication of success for medical or surgical pleurodesis. Although clinical and non-clinical markers, including chest discomfort and pleural manometry 11 , have been investigated to diagnose trapped lung, these indicators are typically used in conjunction with radiographic findings, as no standardized definition currently exists in everyday practice. Accurate recognition of a lung that does not have full apposition with the parietal pleura following thoracentesis is crucial for future treatment planning, such as pleurodesis and intrapleural catheter placement (IPC) 12,13  in patients with or without malignant pleural effusions (MPE).\nThe utility of ultrasound in the post-aspiration setting has been poorly characterized. Ultrasound has proven beneficial in diagnosing post-procedural pneumothorax, demonstrating comparable effectiveness to CXR 14,15 . Additionally, ultrasound has the advantage of delivering real-time clinical data without exposing patients to additional radiation 16-18 . Ultrasound can detect a smaller amounts of pleural fluid than CXR, resulting in greater accuracy when assessing for residual effusion 19,20 . Despite these findings, current societal guidelines 12,21  still recommend post-thoracentesis CXR as standard practice, especially for evaluating complications, assessing complete drainage of the pleural space, and determining if the lung is trapped in conjunction with patient symptomatology.\nWe conducted this multicenter prospective study to investigate the efficacy of postthoracentesis ultrasound vs CXR examination in determining complete effusion evacuation in patients with non-loculated free-flowing pleural effusion. Additionally, our aim was to elucidate the utility of ultrasound in assessing other clinically significant questions, such as assessment for trapped lung following thoracentesis, in comparison to post-procedural CXR.",

      "content": "This study enrolled individuals undergoing therapeutic thoracentesis for large, freeflowing pleural effusions. Eligible participants were aged >18 and exhibited symptomatic moderate or large free-flowing (non-septated) pleural effusion, confirmed by ultrasound in all patients in addition to CXR or CT scan when available. A moderate -large effusion was defined as: (a) effusion filling ≥1/3 of the hemithorax on CXR or (b) CT scan indicating a maximum anterior-posterior (AP) effusion depth ≥1/3 of the AP dimension; or (c) on ultrasound, an effusion spanning at least three rib spaces with the patient sitting upright. All patients had preand post-thoracentesis ultrasound and CXR images available for review. The decision to use a portable vs a PA and lateral CXR was left to each provider for a more pragmatic recruitment process.\nExclusion criteria included 1) the presence of a disease or condition impeding study completion (e.g., coagulopathy or hemodynamic instability); 2) a history of ipsilateral pleurodesis; 3) the presence of more than minimal thin septations (exceeding 3) and/or loculations on bedside pre-procedure ultrasound 24,25 ; 4) a pleural effusion smaller than anticipated on pre-procedure ultrasound; and 5) referral solely for diagnostic thoracentesis. Study Procedures\nAll patients were positioned in an upright sitting posture with bedside thoracic ultrasound performed by an experienced proceduralist to assess the effusion characteristics and the optimal intervention site. Static ultrasound images collected before and after thoracentesis were obtained at end-expiration from three anatomical perspectives (anterior, mid-axillary, and posterior hemithorax). If an image was not documented or visualized on a specific view due to poor access, patient's inability to remain seated, or proceduralist's failure to acquire the image, it was classified as missing. All static ultrasound images and chest radiographs were saved in a de-\nidentified format. Demographic data, including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, laterality of thoracentesis, and suspected etiology of effusion, were recorded.\nThe ultrasound-captured effusion size was estimated by 2 methods: 1) based on the number of rib interspaces in which you can see fluid and 2) effusion volume using the Goecke 2 formula 26 . Pleural fluid echogenicity (anechoic, echogenic, thin septations, moderate to dense septations) was assessed pre-procedure. The shape and motion of the diaphragm, the presence or absence of lung sliding and B-lines, and parenchymal characteristics were documented pre- and post-procedure. Volume of residual fluid pre- and post-procedure were estimated using the Goecke 2 formula. The reasons for the procedure cessations were documented, which included spontaneous cessation of flow despite catheter repositioning, symptoms suggestive of excessively negative pleural pressure (pain experienced in the front or back of the chest or neck, persistent even after catheter adjustment, intractable cough, increased shortness of breath), or other reasons per proceduralist discretion.",

Similarly, two blinded radiologists individually assessed all post-procedure CXR images to determine the presence/absence of a pleural effusion. The reviewers also graded effusion size using two distinct validated scales (Supplementary Table 1) and documented any notable parenchymal abnormalities and presence of pneumothorax. Parenchymal abnormalities were classified as atelectasis, pleural thickening, consolidation, ground-glass opacification, reexpansion pulmonary edema (REPE), nodules, or masses. When disparities emerged regarding a\nresidual effusion on CXR, a third radiologist was consulted to facilitate consensus. For ultrasound images, the data reported by the primary proceduralist were used as third reviewer data to resolve disparities.",

      "title": "Outcomes",
      "content": "The primary outcome was concordance between ultrasound and CXR in determining complete pleural space evacuation. The absence of fluid was defined a priori as no fluid on any ultrasound view (anterior, mid-axillary, and posterior) and no blunting of the costophrenic angle (CPA) on CXR. Post-procedure residual effusions were further classified as \"small\" or \"large\". A \"small\" effusion occupied less than one rib space on all three ultrasound views, while \"large\" effusions equaled or exceeded one rib interspace on any view. On CXR images, a small effusion was defined as blunting of the CPA only (Grade 2 on Methods 1 and 2, Supplementary Table 1), while any effusion exhibiting more than CPA blunting was considered large.\nExploratory endpoints included the correlation between proceduralists' self-assessment of trapped lung after ultrasound and a second assessment after CXR. Lung was defined as trapped a priori based on symptoms suggestive of excessively negative pleural pressure (pain experienced in the front or back of the chest or neck, persistent even after catheter adjustment, intractable cough, increased shortness of breath) and absence of radiographic confirmation of full apposition of the lung with the parietal pleura on ultrasound and CXR. This definition was used to mimic real-world clinical scenarios, where the assessment of trapped lung is based on a combination of patient symptoms, imaging findings and intra-procedural observations. Further we evaluated the concordance of the identification of post-procedural complications by ultrasound and CXR, correlation of observed parenchymal abnormalities across imaging modalities, and the agreement between proceduralist and blinded ultrasound reviewers in\nassessing complete pleural evacuation. Furthermore, we sought to explore any correlation between Body Mass Index (BMI) and the quality of ultrasound images. Finally, we performed an exploratory multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify the pre-procedure ultrasound and patient specific predictors of trapped lung, as judged by the proceduralist at the end of the procedure.",

Spearman's rank correlation was employed to assess the association between BMI, treated as a continuous variable, and the assigned image quality for each view categorized as \"Clear,\" \"Suboptimal/Poor,\" or \"Missing\" by blind reviewers, both before and after the procedure.\nAgreement was measured using Cohen's kappa for all binary data, with interpretation previously described by Landis & Koch 27  . Our analysis revealed a high prevalence of reviews categorizing the outcome as 'observed', resulting in a symmetrically imbalanced contingency table. This resulted in a low or near-zero kappa statistic, falsely indicating poor inter-rater agreement. To address this kappa paradox, we used Gwet's Agreement Coefficient 1 (AC1), which is known for its resistance to such biases and can account for the kappa paradox 28 . Gwet's AC1 ranges from -1 to 1: a coefficient of -1 indicates complete disagreement, less than 0 suggests worse-than-chance agreement, 0 signifies agreement no better than chance, greater than 0 indicates better-than-chance agreement, and 1 reflects high degree of agreement among raters.\nAn exploratory evaluation was conducted to investigate pre-thoracentesis predictors of trapped lung using a multivariable logistic regression model. Model variables, selected based on clinical relevance, included effusion etiology (MPE or Non-MPE), pleural fluid ultrasound\nimage characteristics (anechoic vs echogenic), effusion size, sex, and the number of prior thoracenteses. To account for potential effect modification between cancer and male sex, an interaction term between MPE and sex was developed. Odds ratios are reported with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI). No adjustments were applied to account for missing data. All statistical tests were two-sided with a significance level of 0.05.

Regarding the primary outcome of complete pleural space evacuation, there was a high level of agreement between ultrasound and CXR, with a Gwet's AC1 of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.83-1.00) (Table 3). When assessing agreement based on the pre-specified criteria of effusion size (small vs large), a substantial level of agreement was observed between ultrasound and CXR, indicated by a kappa of 0.64 (95% CI: 0.51-0.77). Ultrasound vs. CXR-guided assessment of trapped lung (per aforementioned a priori definition) showed a strong level of agreement with a kappa of 0.89 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.96). When comparing ultrasound vs CXR for parenchymal abnormalities, pleural thickening exhibited the strongest agreement, with a Gwet's AC1 of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.830.95).\nWhen evaluating concordance concerning the presence or absence of pneumothorax between ultrasound and CXR, a slight to moderate agreement (kappa of 0.30, 95% CI: 0.10-0.50) was noted. Thoracic radiologists exhibited limited agreement among themselves in the evaluation of pneumothorax on CXR (kappa of 0.47 (95% CI: 0.23-0.71)). A total of 6 pneumothoraces were reported in the entire population, none of which required an invasive intervention such as chest tube placement. Among these, 3 small pneumothoraces who were considered to have a  pneumothorax based on US and by the non-blinded radiologist in the recruiting institution, were discharged without need for additional intervention. The other 3 patients had US evidence of pneumothorax which was not noted on CXR. These patients were discharged after 2-4 hours of observation followed by repeat CXR and clinical evaluation to confirm stability. When assessing the agreement between the proceduralist and the blinded ultrasound reviewers regarding complete pleural evacuation, there was a strong agreement with a kappa of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.71-0.90).\nBlind reviewers were more likely to rate the image as suboptimal/poor in individuals with a higher BMI (ρ = 0.194, p = 0.046) on mid-axillary views, among the 106 participants with available BMI data. 141 patients had available data for analysis in the clinical prediction model.

      "content": "In this study, post-thoracentesis thoracic ultrasound and CXR exhibited strong agreement for evaluation of complete pleural space evacuation. This high level of agreement persisted when categorizing ultrasound and CXR images based on residual effusion size (small vs. large).\nAdditionally, a substantial agreement was seen between proceduralists' assessment of trapped lung using ultrasound vs CXR based on pre-defined criteria. Pleural thickening exhibited the strongest agreement between ultrasound and CXR regarding post-procedure parenchymal examination. Our study identified male sex and MPE as potential predictors of trapped lung on US.\nPost-thoracentesis chest radiography has consistently shown a low utility in the absence of symptoms, in addition to increased healthcare costs and radiation exposure 29-31 . Despite recent societal guidelines 6,32  advocating against the use of CXR for asymptomatic patients following thoracentesis, post-procedure CXR is still included in procedure checklists 33  and prominent medical textbooks 34 . These CXRs are often obtained not only for procedural complication assessment but also to assess the degree of lung apposition, parenchymal abnormalities and remaining fluid.\nUltrasound offers the benefits of being cost-effective, providing real-time, portable imaging, and is widely available. Since the introduction of bedside ultrasound for marking and/or procedural guidance in the early 2000s, the occurrence of common complications, such as pneumothorax, has been significantly reduced 14,35 . However, post-thoracentesis ultrasound has rarely been utilized in clinical practice to evaluate other meaningful questions, such as those highlighted in this study. The strong agreement between ultrasound and CXR on the success of pleural space evacuation in this study extends the role of ultrasound to the post-procedural arena and can impact timely management and follow-up, reduce radiation exposure, and change the current post-procedure care algorithm.\nAn additional benefit of post-procedural ultrasonography is that clinically important findings, such as the pre and post-procedure motion and shape of the diaphragm, which are\nrelevant markers of symptomatic response, can predict post-drainage symptom resolution 36 . We underscore that multiple anatomical views should always be obtained when feasible, as patients with an elevated BMI are more likely to have suboptimal or poor images in the mid-axillary view. With a median time of 161 seconds for post-thoracentesis ultrasound evaluation, proceduralists demonstrate the capability to conduct comprehensive assessments, gathering realtime data on underlying lung/pleural space pathology. Our findings would further mandate the necessity of saving and storage of ultrasound images in the electronic medical record, facilitating providers' access to prior post-thoracentesis ultrasound images, and enhancing clinical continuity.\nThis study has several notable strengths. To ensure generalizability, we focused on freeflowing pleural effusion, the most common type of effusion, and enrolled patients from six centers. Our study design was crafted to align with real-world clinical workflows, ensuring the practical applicability of our findings. The precision of our measurements was validated through a collaborative, multi-disciplinary approach involving pulmonologists and thoracic radiologists, providing a thorough assessment of inter-observer reliability. Furthermore, the study's investigation of secondary exploratory endpoints, including self-assessment of lung apposition between ultrasound and CXR and concordance of parenchymal abnormalities, provides a more comprehensive perspective on the use of ultrasound in the post-thoracentesis setting, beyond just complication.\nHowever, it's important to acknowledge certain limitations in our study. Firstly, our study exclusively addresses non-loculated free-flowing pleural effusions, restricting the generalizability to patients with more complex pleural spaces. In addition, 50% of our cohort included patients with MPE which may have contributed to a higher number of  trapped lung.\nThe role of post-procedure ultrasound vs CXR may need to be further explored among populations with higher prevalence of other effusion etiologies. Although ultrasound images were obtained immediately after thoracentesis, CXR images were obtained within 4-hours postdrainage, during which time pleural fluid re-accumulation may have occurred in some patients, which may have contributed to isolated discrepancies Between CXR and ultrasound findings. This, however, represents practice in a real-life setting, as the ultrasound exam at the time of CXR was not considered pragmatic.  In this study, proceduralists were interventional pulmonologists from high-volume academic tertiary-care centers; examination quality and speed may not be generalized to all operators. In addition, proceduralists assessment of trapped lung based on CXR, followed their assessment for trapped lung using patient symptoms and postthoracentesis ultrasound findings, which may have influenced their interpretation of CXR and under or over-estimate trapped lung assessment by CXR. This however represents common clinical practice, as most proceduralists use their clinical bedside information along with CXR to globally assess pleural space physiology.\nFinally, while our findings suggest that ultrasound is generally sufficient for postprocedural pleural space assessment, there may be specific scenarios where a CXR remains useful such as in patients with higher BMI where a CXR may provide additional diagnostic clarity. Further research is needed to determine the optimal imaging approach in this patient population.  Given the lack of ultrasound image storage in most centers, a CXR could serve as a valuable baseline for comparison in patients at risk for re-accumulation. An important practice limitation is that while ultrasound images are available on a separate database, pre and postthoracentesis ultrasound images, and, importantly, videos, are not included within the primary image storage database of most hospitals. Our findings suggest that the inclusion of ultrasound\nimages and videos in primary image storage systems of hospitals, along with detailed interpretation of ultrasound findings in procedure notes, is a valuable initiative and may impact patient care as well as cost.",

The results show that CXR offers limited additional benefits over point-of-care post-procedure ultrasound when assessing drainage of the pleural space. These findings show that ultrasound can effectively assess pleural space evacuation in real time and can be a reliable alternative to CXR. Future studies should focus on the cost-effectiveness and feasibility of implementing point-of-care thoracic ultrasonography in standard post-thoracentesis care.",
