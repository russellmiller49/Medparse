      "content": "advanced diagnostic bronchoscopy; bronchoscopy training; bronchoscopy complications; bronchoscopy efficiency; pulmonary fellowship\nAdvanced diagnostic bronchoscopy (ADB) is essential for the evaluation of thoracic disease. Tissue sampling guided by convex-probe endobronchial ultrasound (cEBUS), radial-probe Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) (rEBUS), electromagnetic navigation (EMN), and robotic-assisted platforms allow bronchoscopists to comprehensively and efficiently characterize both malignant and nonmalignant disorders (1 -10). Consequently, proper training for performing ADB in modern-day bronchoscopy practice is of utmost importance. In the United States, the rapid expansion of a dedicated interventional pulmonology (IP) fellowship infrastructure has helped focus ADB training standards (11, 12).\nADB training also occurs among the more than 100 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education -accredited\ngeneral pulmonary (GP) and pulmonary and critical care medicine (PCCM) fellowships. However, at this level the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education does not specify a minimum competency standard or distinguish ADB from routine flexible bronchoscopy, even though ADB requires additional skill sets (13, 14). Nevertheless, the majority of GP and PCCM fellows perform 50 or more Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscopies and a number of other ADB modalities during fellowship; only an extreme minority get no Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) exposure (15). Although simulator-based training leads to efficient acquisition of technical proficiency (16 -20), the prevalence of organized multimodal bronchoscopy curricula among GP and PCCM fellowships is unknown. Therefore, to teach routine bronchoscopy, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), and peripheral\nnavigation techniques, many programs likely rely to some extent on the ' apprenticeship ' model and a ' minimum volume ' competency standard. In addition, at a large majority of GP and PCCM programs, fellows are supervised in part by interventional pulmonologists (15). These factors highlight an expanding intersection between novice operators and advanced bronchoscopy within the training environment.\nLearning curves for ADB vary widely, and proficiency can continue to evolve through 400 performed clinical cases (21 -25). Therefore, involving novice trainees that are still learning basics of bronchoscopy during advanced procedures may influence important outcomes. A limited body of literature suggests such impacts within the context of routine bronchoscopy (26) or interventional training programs (27, 28). However, to our knowledge, data exclusively analyzing the influence of GP and PCCM fellow participation on\nadvanced bronchoscopy do not exist.\nOur goal was to investigate the impact of PCCM fellow involvement during advanced diagnostic bronchoscopy on procedure efficiency, breadth, diagnostic performance, and patient safety in a realworld setting. Similar to a growing number of practices in the United States, we manage an IP service at an institution without a dedicated IP fellowship. This provides PCCM trainees substantial exposure to our practice environment and, thus, combined with our prospectively collected ADB registry, offers a good data source for such analysis.",

Procedure duration was recorded as time from first introduction of the bronchoscope into the lower airway to its final removal. Major procedure-related complications included pneumothorax requiring a chest tube; bleeding requiring a balloon blocker, ablation, embolization, or blood transfusion; respiratory failure requiring endotracheal intubation; escalation of disposition for any reason; cardiac arrest; and death. All other complications were considered minor. Indicators of procedure breadth were number of lesions sampled, number of diagnostic techniques used, and need for premature termination of a procedure\nfor any reason. Diagnostic techniques were any used for endobronchial, peribronchial (e.g., nodal), and/or peripheral lung sampling, as specified in Figure E1 in the online supplement. Specific diagnostic yield was defined as per-subject recovery of a specific actionable diagnosis, including malignancy, granuloma, organizing pneumonia, and infection (29). Diagnostic sensitivity for malignancy was the persubject number of malignant cases diagnosed by ADB divided by the total number discovered by any means. For nonspecific sampling results, lesion regression or stability up to 2 years by imaging surveillance was required to suggest benignity.",

They were classified based on their level of training at the time of ADB participation (first, second, or third year: post-graduate year [PGY]-4, -5, or -6, respectively). Before the rotation, all fellows were provided supplementary reading material and completed assignments on a high-fidelity simulator (BRONCH Mentor, Surgical Science). During the rotation, fellows were given task-oriented instruction based on established bronchoscopy skills assessment tools (36, 37) and also trained via the apprenticeship model. Our concerted approach to bronchoscopy apprenticeship focuses PGY-4 fellows on basic elements (e.g., airway inspection, anatomy recognition, simple diagnostic techniques such as bronchoalveolar lavage), reserving more advanced and combined techniques for PGY-5 and -6. After the rotation, fellows took a multiple-choice exam and were provided comprehensive feedback on their overall performance. During the second half of PGY-4, pulmonary fellows also\nattended a regional Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) course that consisted of both didactic and simulation components.\nFellow involvement was dictated by usual clinical workflow, and fellows were expected to participate if available. A fellow was considered to have participated in an ADB if they were the primary operator for at least one key component of the procedure. Key components of a procedure included standard bronchoscope intubation and airway inspection, cEBUS scope intubation and peribronchial/mediastinal survey (with or without sampling), or advanced-guidance navigation to a peripheral lesion (with or without sampling). Although many fellows also assisted with or performed sampling, sampling alone did not qualify as participation. The extent to which a fellow performed a given ADB was at the discretion of the IP attending. A large majority of ADBs were performed and supervised by two of four IP faculty (A.A.C. and B.F., 57.3% and 34.7%, respectively), who had collectively completed more than 2,000 ADBs at the start of the study period.",

Our findings can assist fellowship directors and advanced diagnostic bronchoscopists in managing the important interaction between novice operators and bronchoscopy practice within the training environment.\nWe found fellow participation during ADB increased overall bronchoscopy duration by 7.2 minutes, although time differences varied depending on PGY level and procedure type. The reason for such delays within this context is likely multifactorial. Most intuitively, novice operators take longer to complete a given procedure, as they are still acquiring relevant muscle memory and learning new techniques. Intraprocedural adverse events may also reduce efficiency, as the focus shifts to their management. Although we did not observe an increase in major complications with fellow-involved procedures, this is not surprising given the overall favorable safety profile of ADB (38, 39). However, even minor events, such as inefficiently controlled airway bleeding, can divert from procedural objectives.\nThese did occur more frequently during fellow-involved cases. Furthermore, secondary effects, such as excessive coughing, can trigger a cascade of sedative administration and rescue maneuvers that contribute to further delays and patient risk. In support, we found that occurrence of complications also independently increased procedure time.\nIn our study, the overall 7.2-minute increase in procedure duration seen with fellow participation represented an approximate 13% compromise in efficiency compared with an average faculty-performed bronchoscopy. This did not meet our predefined clinically meaningful value of +10 minutes (an approximate 18% increase in procedure time). This somewhat arbitrary threshold was chosen based on the assumption that an average ADB practice performs about four to six procedures daily, and the cumulative impact of even a modest 15 -20% per-procedure decrease in efficiency could sacrifice volume capabilities of at least one per day. For a practice with already limited access to resources, such as dedicated procedure space and/or anesthesia block time, this represents a\n|\nP <= 0.05\nP > 0.05\nsubstantial impact on operations. In addition, longer procedure times may increase labor needs and various other fixed costs, thus reducing the cost efficiency of ADB.\nOur results still have value, given the considerable procedure time variation we observed depending on fellow training levels and ADB type. For example, overall procedure duration differences between fellow and faculty cases were smallest with\nPGY-4 fellows (5.1 min) and largest with PGY-5 fellows (8.8 min). This represents a decreased efficiency range between 9% and 16%, solely based on fellow training level. The differences were most stark with cEBUS bronchoscopy, with fellow cases prolonged between a range of 2.5 minutes (PGY-4) and 14.5 minutes (PGY-5), compared with a 37.5-minute facultyperformed cEBUS (Figure 1). This\nDefinition of abbreviations : cEBUS=convex-probe endobronchial ultrasound; EMN=electromagnetic navigation; IP = interventional pulmonology; rEBUS = radial-probe endobronchial ultrasound; ROSE = rapid on-site cytologic evaluation.\n*As defined in the text.\n† Use for most days for at least 2 weeks before procedure date.\n‡ cEBUS plus rEBUS or EMN.\n§ After originally scheduled time.\nrepresents a decreased efficiency range between 7% and 39%. Therefore, the magnitude of the impact incurred by fellow involvement will depend on a particular bronchoscopy practice ' s ADB case mix and trainee profile. Furthermore, when prioritizing operational efficiency within a training environment, bronchoscopists should also consider other factors that may independently prolong procedure duration. Per our data, these include use of general anesthesia, rapid on-site evaluation, and case breadth and complexity.\nThe variations in procedure duration differentials seen among training level strata are consistent with our ADB training approach. We focus PGY-4 fellows on basic bronchoscopy aspects (e.g., airway inspection, anatomy recognition, mucosal biopsies, etc.), while introducing and developing more advanced techniques (e.g., Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided sampling, peripheral bronchoscopy) at the PGY-5 and -6 level, when fellows have had more exposure to ADB-specific curricula. Consequently, the ADB learning curve at our program is steepest for PGY-5 fellows. This could explain their long procedure times across multiple procedure types, but especially cEBUS bronchoscopy, which is the primary focus of ADB education for our PCCM fellows. Procedure efficiency and complication outcomes both improved slightly in PGY-6, suggesting some acquisition of real-world ADB proficiency toward the completion of the fellowship. A similar pattern was previously reported with routine bronchoscopy in another study (26). Therefore, to adjust both training and operational expectations, PCCM programs should identify fellows at the steepest portion of the ADB learning curve at their respective institutions. Aggressive supplemental simulation may be most important at or just before this stage to help enhance\nuptake of technical skill and optimize the transition to real-world apprenticeship training (16, 17, 40, 41).\nThe overall procedure duration differential between fellow and faculty cases of our study was considerably smaller than a previous report by Stather and colleagues (27), which found that fellow involvement prolonged procedures by 21 minutes (about a 36% decrease in efficiency). However, in contrast to our study, which focused on a heterogeneous group of PCCM fellows, theirs was conducted within an IP training program; the majority of cases were performed by an IP fellow and without the use of supplemental bronchoscopy simulation. Such factors imply different baseline fellow proficiencies, intraprocedural training goals, and the extent to which a trainee may be allowed and expected to independently perform a procedure.\nThese and other workflow characteristics could account for the differences in our respective findings and dictate the varying needs of a given training model.\nCollectively, our results emphasize the importance of acknowledging individual aspects of a given PCCM bronchoscopy training program and adapting to its strengths and limitations. At present, there is no nationally established competency requirement guiding fellow readiness for ADB techniques (14). We suggest fellowship directors establish internal milestone metrics within the context of a multimodal curriculum, recognizing that acquisition of bronchoscopy proficiency is highly variable and individualized (21 -25). Meanwhile, bronchoscopy faculty should be mindful of fellows lacking basic bronchoscopy skills whose involvement with ADBs could hamper the various operational, performance, and costefficiency advantages of these essential\n|\nand often complex procedures (42 -44). To more holistically evaluate fellow impacts on bronchoscopy operations, future investigations should incorporate not only the elements of our study but also components that may highlight patient-centered and logistical aspects to which fellows might positively contribute, such as obtaining informed consent, order entry, and followup practices.",

      "title": "Limitations",
      "content": "The main limitation of our study is its retrospective and single-institution design, although the data originated from a prospectively maintained quality improvement\ndatabase and analyzed a consecutive cohort. The supervising bronchoscopy faculty for our study were skilled interventional pulmonologists. This may have been part of the reason we did not observe a significant compromise in ADB diagnostic performance with fellow-involved procedures. The impact of trainee involvement at programs with less experienced bronchoscopy faculty is unknown. Regardless, our practice model of an IP service without a dedicated IP fellowship is increasingly common in the United States, with interventional pulmonologists frequently charged with training GP and PCCM fellows (15). Therefore, we consider our findings generalizable to and valuable for a substantial proportion of such fellowships.\nWe acknowledge that several fellow-related factors may have been unrecognized in our analysis. First, we did not factor the correlation inherent in procedures done by the same fellow. However, we believe the impact of this potential confounding would be limited, because most fellows rotated on our bronchoscopy service only once during their fellowship, thus minimizing the repeated measures effect across training level strata. In addition, we had a relatively\nlarge number of fellows (34) contribute data to the study, but individually they only performed a median of six ADBs to the extent required to meet our ' participation ' criteria.\nSecond, baseline fellow bronchoscopy experience and proficiency were not measured or controlled. Although all fellows were expected to complete a supplemental multimodal bronchoscopy curriculum, we did not rigorously verify the extent of their engagement before the rotation. Nevertheless, even fellows within a given training year with similar baseline experience have varying proficiencies (26). Furthermore, the ideal curriculum that best maximizes acquisition and assessment of bronchoscopy skill within a GP or PCCM program remains unknown (19, 20, 39, 45, 46). Our intent was to simulate a real-world interaction between modern bronchoscopy training and an ADB practice, and many of these variables are typical among such programs.\nFinally, the arrival of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic overlapped with a portion of the study period. Although we maintained our general approach to fellow training and supervision, it is unclear how specific modifications to our bronchoscopy operations (e.g., enhanced isolation practices, minimizing elective cases, etc.) and other intangible factors affected the outcomes of interest. It is possible that during peak surges supervising bronchoscopists allowed less latitude for fellows to independently complete a bronchoscopy. Consequently, the reductions in efficiency and increases in complications seen within the fellow groups may have been underestimated. Nevertheless, we consider our findings significant and consistent enough to support our conclusions.",
