Historically, definitive treatment involved a surgical procedure and hospitalization, with a median length of stay ranging from 5 to 10 days depending on the specific procedure performed. 5 Thoracoscopic talc pleurodesis may be performed by an interventional pulmonologist in an endoscopy suite using one access port with local anesthesia and moderate sedation. A video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) pleurodesis procedure, however, is usually performed by a thoracic surgeon in an operating room. This procedure is more invasive because it typically requires multiple access ports, a double-lumen endotracheal tube, and general anesthesia. Both procedures allow for biopsy of the parietal pleura, evaluation of full lung re-expansion, lysis of simple adhesions, and adequate instillation of pleural sclerosants, but VATS may allow for improved visualization of the pleura given the lung is fully deflated. 5 VATS also provides the ability to perform complementary procedures such as mechanical abrasion, lysis of more complex adhesions, decortication for treatment of nonexpandable lung, and parietal pleurectomy, which may be beneficial in certain clinical scenarios. 5 VATS is typically reserved for patients with good functional status who are deemed acceptable surgical candidates, but for those not meeting these criteria, alternative treatment methods are typically pursued."

Although the specific details regarding how symptom and radiographic improvement were determined were not provided, all patients were reported to have symptomatic benefit in cough, dyspnea, and exercise tolerance. 26 Several larger observational studies on the use of IPC for patients with nonexpandable lung have since been published, each reporting various patient outcomes, including symptom improvement, pleurodesis rate, median survival after IPC placement, and complications. 27-32 It is difficult to directly compare results from these studies because the units of measurement for the outcomes are quite variable, but most studies report symptomatic improvement in the majority of patients. More recent RCTs have shown improvement in dyspnea and quality of life that is comparable with that achieved in patients with a fully expandable lung after talc pleurodesis. 10 It should also be noted that, in the AMPLE-2 trial, approximately 50% of patients with a nonexpandable lung achieved pleurodesis at 6 months. 23 In addition to patients with a nonexpandable lung, IPC placement may be the best treatment strategy for those with interconnected pleural loculations, especially if deemed a poor surgical candidate. 7"

Fortunately, recent research has shown that the complication rates are relatively low, albeit not negligible.

The future of MPE management likely lies in combined therapies, such as IPC plus a pleural sclerosant, at least in patients whose lung expands with drainage. This combination therapy may provide more optimal benefits than each individual procedure, although further research is needed. Effective pleurodesis and subsequent IPC removal is important, especially in regard to cost effectiveness and burden of catheter-related care, but future research should ideally focus on patient-centered outcomes. 15 Consistency of measurements between studies would also allow for a more direct comparison of results and add to the current body of knowledge."

        "abstract": "Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) affects more than 1 million people globally. There is a dearth of evidence on the therapeutic approach to MPE, and not surprisingly a high degree of variability in the management thereof. We aimed to provide practicing clinicians with an overview of the current evidence on the management of MPE, preferentially focusing on studies that report patient-related outcomes rather than pleurodesis alone, and to provide guidance on how to approach individual cases. A pleural intervention for MPE will perforce be palliative in nature. A therapeutic thoracentesis provides immediate relief for most. It can be repeated, especially in patients with a slow rate of recurrence and a short anticipated survival. Definitive interventions, individualized according the patient's wishes, performance status, prognosis and other considerations (including the ability of the lung to expand) should be offered to the remainder of patients. Chemical pleurodesis (achieved via intercostal drain or pleuroscopy) and indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) have equal impact on patient-based outcomes, although patients treated with IPC spend less time in hospital and have less need for repeat pleural drainage interventions. Talc slurry via IPC is an attractive recently validated option for patients who do not have a nonexpandable lung."

In recent years, several well-designed randomised clinical trials have been published that have changed the landscape of MPE management. The European Respiratory Society (ERS) and the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) established a multidisciplinary collaboration of clinicians with expertise in the management of MPE with the aim of producing a comprehensive review of the scientific literature.Six areas of interest were identified, including the optimum management of symptomatic MPE, management of trapped lung in MPE, management of loculated MPE, prognostic factors in MPE, whether there is a role for oncological therapies prior to intervention for MPE and whether a histological diagnosis is always required in MPE.The literature revealed that talc pleurodesis and indwelling pleural catheters effectively manage the symptoms of MPE. There was limited evidence regarding the management of trapped lung or loculated MPE. The LENT score was identified as a validated tool for predicting survival in MPE, with Brims' prognostic score demonstrating utility in mesothelioma prognostication. There was no evidence to support the use of oncological therapies as an alternative to MPE drainage, and the literature supported the use of tissue biopsy as the gold standard for diagnosis and treatment planning."

They are simple to place and can be done on an outpatient basis under local anesthesia. IPCs uniformly relieve dyspnea and improve quality of life of patients with malignant pleural effusions. In some patients with recurrent non-malignant pleural effusions, IPCs proved to be effective as well. With increasing use of IPCs, physicians and patients are faced with complications related to the presence of an indwelling catheter for extended periods of time. The purpose of this review is to describe the various complications of IPCs and to present the available data on how to best treat and potentially prevent these complications."

        "abstract": "Malignant pleural effusions (MPE) are frequent consequences of malignant disease and significantly impair the quality of life (QoL) of patients. There are two main options for the palliation of MPE-related symptoms: obliterating the pleural space by pleurodesis to prevent further fluid reaccumulation, or chronically draining the pleural fluid with an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC). There is controversy as to which approach is superior each having advantages and drawbacks. Pleurodesis offers a higher chance of rapid resolution of the pleural effusion with an intervention that is time limited but at the expense of a more invasive procedure, the need for a hospital stay and a higher need for repeat procedures. IPC offers an outpatient solution which is less invasive but at the cost of prolonged catheter drainages and care in a significant portion of patients who will not achieve pleurodesis. Impact on QoL, symptom relief and costs do not appear to be significantly different between the two options. Treatment of MPE should be tailored to the patient's functional status, comorbidities, prognosis and personal preferences as well as local expertise. Hybrid approaches using pleurodesis techniques and IPC concomitantly may come into play in the near future to further improve patient care."

        "abstract": "Management of recurrent malignant pleural effusion associated with trapped lung syndrome remains problematic. An alternative treatment using a pleural catheter has been advocated. Between August 1999 and August 2002, 127 patients underwent thoracoscopy for malignant pleural effusion. Of these, 52 (41%) with trapped lung were managed by insertion of a pleural catheter. Mean age was 66 years (range, 42-89 years). The most frequent diagnosis was breast cancer. Spontaneous pleurodesis (drainage &lt; 10 mL) occurred in 25 (48%) patients whose catheter was removed after 30 to 255 days (mean, 93.8 days). Symptomatic relief was achieved in 49 (94%) patients. Mean dyspnea score improved significantly from 3.0 to 1.9. Complications comprised catheter blockage, surgical emphysema, cellulitis, and loculated effusion in 2 patients each. Mean length of hospital stay was 3 days (range, 1-16 days). Median survival was 126 days (range, 10-175 days). We conclude that long-term placement of a pleural catheter provides effective palliation for malignant pleural effusion associated with trapped lung syndrome."

        "abstract": "Malignant pleural effusions in the presence of trapped lung remain notoriously difficult to treat. Various methods exist ranging from minimally invasive procedures including repeated needle thoracocentesis to the need for a formal surgical procedure such as placement of a pleuroperitoneal shunt and even thoracotomy and decortication. Controversy exists as to what is the optimum treatment for this condition. Any planned treatment should balance the therapeutic benefit provided against convalesce for a disease with a limited life expectancy. Patients should not spend a significant proportion of their remaining life span recovering from palliative procedures. In a series of patients with malignant pleural effusion the medial survival time was 20 weeks, with 30 days and 1 year mortality rates of 12.8% and 83.6%, respectively. We describe our five-year experience with the use of indwelling PleurX catheters in patients with malignant pleural effusions in the presence of confirmed trapped lung on radiological or VATS investigation. Patient health related quality of life was investigated by telephone questionnaire. The parameters analysed were symptomatic relief, mobility and ease of management following insertion. One hundred and sixteen patients underwent PleurX catheter insertion by a single operator, 48 questionnaires were completed. Of the 48 cases analysed, improvement in all three quality of life indices was recorded following catheter insertion. Ease of mobility was recorded as moderately satisfied and very satisfied in 50% and 15% of patients, respectively. Symptomatic improvement was found to have been increased with 42% and 6% of patients responding to moderately satisfied and very satisfied, respectively. Ease of management was recorded as 'slightly satisfied' and moderately satisfied in 50% and 33% of patients, respectively, demonstrating a high satisfaction index in patients with chronic progressively debilitating malignancies. Complications were either transient or readily correctable. Pain was the predominant complication occurring in 35% of patients lasting &lt;3 days. No patient required catheter removal for resolution of discomfort. Our findings support the use of PleurX catheters for palliative patients with malignant pleural effusions in the presence of trapped lung. The catheters are not only easy to insert and discrete but they can be managed effectively by patients and community nurse practitioners and prevent repeated admissions to hospital in palliative patients with compromised life expectancy."

        "abstract": "<b>Rationale:</b> The likelihood of achieving pleurodesis after indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) placement for malignant pleural effusion varies with the specific drainage strategy used: symptom-guided drainage, daily drainage, or talc instillation through the IPC (IPC&#x2009;+&#x2009;talc). The relative cost-effectiveness of one strategy over the other is unknown.<b>Objectives:</b> We performed a decision tree model-based analysis to ascertain the cost-effectiveness of each IPC drainage strategy from a healthcare system perspective.<b>Methods:</b> We developed a decision tree model using theoretical event probability data derived from three randomized clinical trials and used 2019 Medicare reimbursement data for cost estimation. The primary outcome was incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) over an analytical horizon of 6 months with a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis and one-way sensitivity analyses were conducted to measure the uncertainty surrounding base case estimates.<b>Results:</b> IPC&#x2009;+&#x2009;talc was a cost-effective alternative to symptom-guided drainage, with an ICER of $59,729/QALY. Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed that this strategy was favored in 54% of simulations. However, symptom-guided drainage was cost effective for pleurodesis rates &gt;20% and for life expectancy &lt;4 months. Daily drainage was not cost effective in any scenario, including for patients with nonexpandable lung, in whom it had an ICER of $2,474,612/QALY over symptom-guided drainage.<b>Conclusions:</b> For patients with malignant pleural effusion and an expandable lung, IPC&#x2009;+&#x2009;talc may be cost effective relative to symptom-guided drainage, although considerable uncertainty exists around this estimation. Daily IPC drainage is not a cost-effective strategy under any circumstance."

While it is known that malignant pleural effusion portends a poor prognosis, mortality of patients with nonmalignant effusions has not been well studied.This prospective cohort study evaluated 308 patients undergoing thoracentesis. Chart review was performed to obtain baseline characteristics. The aetiology of the effusions was determined using standardised criteria. Mortality was determined at 30 days and 1 year.247 unilateral and 61 bilateral thoracenteses were performed. Malignant effusion had the highest 30-day (37%) and 1-year (77%) mortality. There was substantial patient 30-day and 1-year mortality with effusions due to multiple benign aetiologies (29% and 55%), congestive heart failure (22% and 53%), and renal failure (14% and 57%, respectively). Patients with bilateral, relative to unilateral, pleural effusion were associated with higher risk of death at 30 days and 1 year (17% versus 47% (hazard ratio (HR) 2.58, 95% CI 1.44-4.63) and 36% versus 69% (HR 2.32, 95% CI 1.55-3.48), respectively).Patients undergoing thoracentesis for pleural effusion have high short- and long-term mortality. Patients with malignant effusion had the highest mortality followed by multiple benign aetiologies, congestive heart failure and renal failure. Bilateral pleural effusion is distinctly associated with high mortality."

Recent studies demonstrate a high mortality in patients with \"benign\" pleural effusions, now better characterized as nonmalignant pleural effusions (NMPEs) based on their prognosis. The most common nonmalignant clinical conditions with recurrent pleural effusions are congestive heart failure and hepatic hydrothorax, although many other diseases exist in isolation or as comorbid conditions. When conventional therapy fails, thoracentesis is often performed for relief of dyspnea. Many times, however, the effusions recur despite maximal medical therapy. Placement of tunneled or indwelling pleural catheters provides an effective therapeutic strategy for recurrent NMPEs when other medical therapy fails."
