Further, lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality and this is projected to increase by 2020 (11,12). The National Lung Cancer Screening Trial demonstrated relative risk reduction in mortality by 20% with the application of lung cancer screening by low-dose CT to a pre-specified target population of highrisk patients (13).

Many digital imaging networks upload lower fidelity thick-cuts of 4-5 mm which compromises a full assessment of bronchial anatomy via 3D reconstruction. Thin-cut CT images on the order of 1 mm provide the bronchoscopist with a better sense of the aforementioned variables and therefore need to be requested. For instance, small airways leading to the target and its relationship to the lesion may become more apparent on a thin-cut CT. Additionally, one can assess the acuity of sub-segmental branch points, the number of bifurcations of a given pathway to the lesion, and an estimate of the trajectory of sampling tools needed to access the lesion. This is likely to assist the operator in optimal tools selection, e.g., extended working channels (EWC), needles, cytology brushes, and biopsy forceps, thus developing a meticulous approach to sampling."

Subtle differences exist depending upon which commercial system is used, however, the concept of identifying the target lesion and closest immediate airway while working back to the more central airway, so called 'the breadcrumb method', is conceptually similar. The view offering the best alignment is determined by the bronchoscopist. However, by using different views, one can identify airways and paths that would otherwise not be obvious in single views.

Literature examining TTNA may provide some insights as to mechanisms and risk factors. Longer needle passes, emphysema, smaller nodules, traversing fissure, and repeated pleural punctures, are all associated with increased risk of pneumothorax from TTNA (62-64). Shared characteristics that may increase the risk for EMN bronchoscopy related pneumothoraces include small nodules in close proximity to the pleura and proximity to the fissure. In both cases there is a greater risk of violating the visceral pleura. Chino et al. illustrated this relationship and risk of pneumothorax in a retrospective study of 991 patients (65).

Chen et  al. noted that nodules can move up to 4 cm or more during respiration (36). Also, the nodule movement is significantly more accentuated in the lower lobes compared to the upper lobes. For peripheral nodules as small as 1 cm, difference due to registration and/or navigation error can result in puncture of the visceral pleura by overshooting the lesion. In the authors' experiences, use of fluoroscopy may mitigate this by visualization of the biopsy catheter and tools in relation to fluoroscopically visible nodules and the periphery combined with tactile feedback."

Subsequently, a study of 24 patients showed no adverse cardiac events or navigation errors (67).

While the exact cost of a system is variable, the initial capital purchase can be easily more than 100,000 US dollars. The list price for the Veran SpinDrive TM is $225,000 with a $30,000/year service contract that includes procedural support, software upgrades, and hardware damage. In comparison the list price for superDimension TM is approximately $250,000 with an annual service contract pricing ranging from 14,000 to 32,000 $. In addition to the upfront capital outlay, the two commercially available systems use a number of proprietary biopsy tools and catheters. While a direct per procedure comparison is not possible due to variance in individual provider practices, one can expect to use at least 1,000-2,000 $ worth of disposables per case."

It has transformed the landscape of bronchoscopy and opened avenues for innovation in the diagnosis and treatment of early stage lung cancer. As the technology advances, we anticipate intuitive platforms with improved accuracy and greater efficiency. Successful application of technology requires proper education and training of the operator, focus on program development, institutional support, and multi-disciplinary teams to engage, interact, and communicate effectively."
