    "abstract": "The breadth of knowledge regarding IPCs has increased substantially in the last decade. Available research has established that IPCs are effective at improving patient symptoms and minimizing hospitalization rates and lengths of stay, but are associated with a risk of potential complications. Fortunately, recent research has shown that the complication rates are relatively low, albeit not negligible. Pleurodesis rates achieved with IPCs are lower when compared with chemical or surgical pleurodesis, but IPCs are associated with a decreased need for repeat pleural procedures and similar quality of life. Understanding individual patient preferences and utilities is essential when determining optimal management for a recurrent, symptomatic pleural effusion and this information should influence treatment decisions. The future of MPE management likely lies in combined therapies, such as IPC plus a pleural sclerosant, at least in patients whose lung expands with drainage. This combination therapy may provide more optimal benefits than each individual procedure, although further research is needed. Effective pleurodesis and subsequent IPC removal is important, especially in regard to cost effectiveness and burden of catheter-related care, but future research should ideally focus on patient-centered outcomes. 15 Consistency of measurements between studies would also allow for a more direct comparison of results and add to the current body of knowledge.

Historically, definitive treatment involved a surgical procedure and hospitalization, with a median length of stay ranging from 5 to 10 days depending on the specific procedure performed. 5 Thoracoscopic talc pleurodesis may be performed by an interventional pulmonologist in an endoscopy suite using one access port with local anesthesia and moderate sedation. A video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) pleurodesis procedure, however, is usually performed by a thoracic surgeon in an operating room. This procedure is more invasive because it typically requires multiple access ports, a double-lumen endotracheal tube, and general anesthesia. Both procedures allow for biopsy of the parietal pleura, evaluation of full lung re-expansion, lysis of simple adhesions, and adequate instillation of pleural sclerosants, but VATS may allow for improved visualization of the pleura given the lung is fully deflated. 5 VATS also provides the ability to perform complementary procedures such as mechanical abrasion, lysis of more complex adhesions, decortication for treatment of nonexpandable lung, and parietal pleurectomy, which may be beneficial in certain clinical scenarios. 5 VATS is typically reserved for patients with good functional status who are deemed acceptable surgical candidates, but for those not meeting these criteria, alternative treatment methods are typically pursued."

In patients with a nonexpandable lung, where adequate apposition of the parietal and visceral pleura are not achieved after pleural fluid drainage, guidelines recommend the placement of an IPC over chemical pleurodesis. 6-8 One of the first publications to report the use of IPCs for MPE and nonexpandable lung was by Pien and colleagues in 2001, 26 when they described their experience with 11 patients, 3 of whom had previously been treated with radiation therapy, attempted talc pleurodesis, or decortication without successful resolution of symptoms. Although the specific details regarding how symptom and radiographic improvement were determined were not provided, all patients were reported to have symptomatic benefit in cough, dyspnea, and exercise tolerance. 26 Several larger observational studies on the use of IPC for patients with nonexpandable lung have since been published, each reporting various patient outcomes, including symptom improvement, pleurodesis rate, median survival after IPC placement, and complications. 27-32 It is difficult to directly compare results from these studies because the units of measurement for the outcomes are quite variable, but most studies report symptomatic improvement in the majority of patients. More recent RCTs have shown improvement in dyspnea and quality of life that is comparable with that achieved in patients with a fully expandable lung after talc pleurodesis. 10 It should also be noted that, in the AMPLE-2 trial, approximately 50% of patients with a nonexpandable lung achieved pleurodesis at 6 months. 23 In addition to patients with a nonexpandable lung, IPC placement may be the best treatment strategy for those with interconnected pleural loculations, especially if deemed a poor surgical candidate. 7"

More recent publications, however, emphasize patient-centered outcomes such as dyspnea, quality of life, complications, and hospital length of stay. 10-12,23 It is from these studies that we know IPCs improve patient symptoms, but are only associated with modest improvements in quality-adjusted lifedays and utility. The greatest improvements are seen in patients with worse baseline shortness of breath and those who pursue systemic chemotherapy or localized radiation after placement. 15 There are also potential disadvantages to treatment with an IPC, including complications, cost, and the need for regular drainage procedures. These issues further highlight the need for a thorough discussion regarding patient preferences and expected outcomes during individualized management of an MPE."

Although the specific details regarding how symptom and radiographic improvement were determined were not provided, all patients were reported to have symptomatic benefit in cough, dyspnea, and exercise tolerance. 26 Several larger observational studies on the use of IPC for patients with nonexpandable lung have since been published, each reporting various patient outcomes, including symptom improvement, pleurodesis rate, median survival after IPC placement, and complications. 27-32 It is difficult to directly compare results from these studies because the units of measurement for the outcomes are quite variable, but most studies report symptomatic improvement in the majority of patients. More recent RCTs have shown improvement in dyspnea and quality of life that is comparable with that achieved in patients with a fully expandable lung after talc pleurodesis. 10 It should also be noted that, in the AMPLE-2 trial, approximately 50% of patients with a nonexpandable lung achieved pleurodesis at 6 months. 23 In addition to patients with a nonexpandable lung, IPC placement may be the best treatment strategy for those with interconnected pleural loculations, especially if deemed a poor surgical candidate. 7",

In patients with a nonexpandable lung, where adequate apposition of the parietal and visceral pleura are not achieved after pleural fluid drainage, guidelines recommend the placement of an IPC over chemical pleurodesis. 6-8 One of the first publications to report the use of IPCs for MPE and nonexpandable lung was by Pien and colleagues in 2001, 26 when they described their experience with 11 patients, 3 of whom had previously been treated with radiation therapy, attempted talc pleurodesis, or decortication without successful resolution of symptoms. Although the specific details regarding how symptom and radiographic improvement were determined were not provided, all patients were reported to have symptomatic benefit in cough, dyspnea, and exercise tolerance. 26 Several larger observational studies on the use of IPC for patients with nonexpandable lung have since been published, each reporting various patient outcomes, including symptom improvement, pleurodesis rate, median survival after IPC placement, and complications. 27-32 It is difficult to directly compare results from these studies because the units of measurement for the outcomes are quite variable, but most studies report symptomatic improvement in the majority of patients. More recent RCTs have shown improvement in dyspnea and quality of life that is comparable with that achieved in patients with a fully expandable lung after talc pleurodesis. 10 It should also be noted that, in the AMPLE-2 trial, approximately 50% of patients with a nonexpandable lung achieved pleurodesis at 6 months. 23 In addition to patients with a nonexpandable lung, IPC placement may be the best treatment strategy for those with interconnected pleural loculations, especially if deemed a poor surgical candidate. 7",

Two RCTs, ASAP (Impact of Aggressive vs Standard Drainage Regimen Using a Long Term IPC) and AMPLE-2 (Australasian Malignant PLeural Effusion-2) evaluated patient outcomes with various drainage regimens. The ASAP trial compared daily with every other day drainage of the same volume of fluid, 24 whereas the AMPLE-2 study compared daily with symptom-guided IPC drainage. 23 Both studies defined pleurodesis as pleural fluid drainage of less than 50 mL on 3 consecutive drainage attempts and improved radiographic scores, but the ASAP trial also specified a lack of patient symptoms. 23,24 Each study determined that daily IPC drainage was more likely to result in either complete or partial pleurodesis after IPC placement, with associated fewer catheter-days, when compared with a less aggressive drainage regimen, although pleurodesis rates were not the primary outcome in the AMPLE-2 trial. 23,24 Most cases of pleurodesis and catheter removal occurred in the first 60 days after placement. 23,24 If IPC removal is a patient priority, then an aggressive drainage regimen should be used, but in instances when this is not a strong consideration, symptom-guided drainage is reasonable. 4",

Although patients with a nonexpandable lung had an overall lower pleurodesis rate than patients whose lungs expanded, aggressive IPC drainage was still associated with a higher pleurodesis rate when compared with symptom-guided drainage in patients with nonexpandable lung. 23 Although this data may provide insight as to the effect of daily drainage on patients with a nonexpandable lung, it should be interpreted with caution because it was obtained after a post hoc analysis of very few patients.

In patients with a nonexpandable lung, where adequate apposition of the parietal and visceral pleura are not achieved after pleural fluid drainage, guidelines recommend the placement of an IPC over chemical pleurodesis. 6-8 One of the first publications to report the use of IPCs for MPE and nonexpandable lung was by Pien and colleagues in 2001, 26 when they described their experience with 11 patients, 3 of whom had previously been treated with radiation therapy, attempted talc pleurodesis, or decortication without successful resolution of symptoms. Although the specific details regarding how symptom and radiographic improvement were determined were not provided, all patients were reported to have symptomatic benefit in cough, dyspnea, and exercise tolerance. 26 Several larger observational studies on the use of IPC for patients with nonexpandable lung have since been published, each reporting various patient outcomes, including symptom improvement, pleurodesis rate, median survival after IPC placement, and complications. 27-32 It is difficult to directly compare results from these studies because the units of measurement for the outcomes are quite variable, but most studies report symptomatic improvement in the majority of patients. More recent RCTs have shown improvement in dyspnea and quality of life that is comparable with that achieved in patients with a fully expandable lung after talc pleurodesis. 10 It should also be noted that, in the AMPLE-2 trial, approximately 50% of patients with a nonexpandable lung achieved pleurodesis at 6 months. 23 In addition to patients with a nonexpandable lung, IPC placement may be the best treatment strategy for those with interconnected pleural loculations, especially if deemed a poor surgical candidate. 7",
          "ave been conducted. Two RCTs, ASAP (Impact of Aggressive vs Standard Drainage Regimen Using a Long Term IPC) and AMPLE-2 (Australasian Malignant PLeural Effusion-2) evaluated patient outcomes with various drainage regimens. The ASAP trial compared daily with every other day drainage of the same volume of fluid, 24 whereas the AMPLE-2 study compared daily with symptom-guided IPC drainage. 23 Both studies defined pleurodesis as pleural fluid drainage of less than 50 mL on 3 consecutive drainage attempts and improved radiographic scores, but the ASAP trial also specified a lack of patient symptoms. 23,24 Each study determined that daily IPC drainage was more likely to result in either complete or partial pleurodesis after IPC placement, with associated fewer catheter-days, when compared with a less aggressive drainage regimen, although pleurodesis rates were not the primary outcome in the AMPLE-2 trial. 23,24 Most cases of pleurodesis and catheter removal occurred in the first 60 days after placement. 23,24 If IPC removal is a patient priority, then an aggressive drainage regimen should be used, but in instances when this is not a strong consideration, symptom-guided drainage is reasonable. 4",
          "hose with a fully expandable lung because of a lack of formal studies evaluating this topic. Approximately one-third of the patients included in the AMPLE-2 trial had nonexpandable lung. Although patients with a nonexpandable lung had an overall lower pleurodesis rate than patients whose lungs expanded, aggressive IPC drainage was still associated with a higher pleurodesis rate when compared with symptom-guided drainage in patients with nonexpandable lung. 23 Although this data may provide insight as to the effect of daily drainage on patients with a nonexpandable lung, it should be interpreted with caution because it was obtained after a post hoc analysis of very few patients. If catheter removal is a priority, then an aggressive IPC drainage strategy can be considered, even in the setting of a nonexpandable lung, but in patients who experience significant discomfort with daily drainage, this regimen is not recommended. 4",

Putnam and colleagues 13 also determined that the initial hospital length of stay was significantly shorter for the IPC group when compared with the pleurodesis group. Two other studies have evaluated hospital length of stay in patients undergoing IPC placement versus talc pleurodesis as a secondary outcome and also found an IPC shortens the duration of the initial hospitalization. 10,12 A smaller observational study came to the same conclusion as these larger RCTs when comparing IPC versus VATS talc pleurodesis. 39 Overall, it is clear from the literature that IPC placement is associated with fewer hospitalization days when compared with chemical pleurodesis using either chest tubes or thoracoscopy.",

It should also be noted that patients with advanced heart and liver disease who have pleural effusions may have similar mortality rates to patients with MPE. 41,42 Whereas IPCs were initially designed for treatment of MPE, their use in patients with NMPEs is increasing. Older publications included patients with a variety of etiologies for their NMPE and are composed primarily of low-quality non-RCTs. Newer studies, however, have evaluated the safety and efficacy of IPCs for NMPEs from specific etiologies. This finding is important because the efficacy and complication rates of IPCs varies significantly based on the underlying cause of the effusion.",

Small retrospective case series describing the use of IPC for refractory chylothorax report pleurodesis rates up to 64% with no significant infectious or nutritional complications reported. 49,50 Because the use of IPCs for NMPEs may continue to increase over time, well-designed RCTs will be necessary to determine how suitable they are for long-term use in specific patient populations.",

There are several instances where the removal of an IPC and the placement of a chest tube may be necessary. These circumstances include concomitant tunnel tract and pleural space infection, poor pleural fluid drainage despite fibrinolytic administration, or a poor clinical response to aggressive treatment. 4,14 Historically, there have been concerns that patients actively treated with chemotherapy may be at increased risk of IPC-related infectious complications, but current evidence suggests otherwise. 4,54 There are currently no recommendations for prophylactic IPC removal before chemotherapy administration or to withhold placement in preparation for systemic treatment. 4",
