However, a prerequisite for performing ablative interventions is a thorough understanding of the technologies used for tumor ablation and the mechanisms that factor into their success or failure. This paper will discuss the general principles of ablation technologies, concentrating on those most applicable to transbronchial ablation, highlighting current data regarding the use of the thermal based technologies, and"

The idea of intratumor ablation stemmed from a case report that described the unexpected resolution of hyperparathyroidism after fine needle aspiration of a parathyroid adenoma believed to be due to intraglandular hemorrhage [1]. This report inspired Luigi Solbiati, a pioneer in image-guided tumor ablation (IGTA), to explore the intentional injection of sclerosing agents into tumors to achieve a comparable outcome. In 1985, his group used ultrasound-guided ethanol injection to treat seven patients with hyperparathyroidism caused by parathyroid adenoma successfully [2]. Subsequent studies employing ethanol injection to treat small encapsulated hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC) similarly demonstrated promising results, establishing it as an effective treatment for HCC [3]."

The concept of using extreme heat or cold to destroy tissue has been recognized since ancient times, and Hippocrates documented the application of heat to treat tumors of the skin [6]. However, the knowledge gained from ethanol ablation led to exploring the application of localized heat and cold to treat non-superficial tumors. Various techniques exist for thermal ablation to include cryoablation (CA), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA), high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), bronchoscopic laser interstitial thermal therapy (BLITT), and bronchoscopic thermal vapor ablation (BTAV). However, for this focused introduction, we will be focusing on RFA, MWA, and CA."

Although the effects of thermal ablation can vary based on the specific type of tissue (i.e., physical and biological properties) and the ablation technique being employed, significant tissue changes typically do not occur below 42 °C. At temperatures above 42 °C, prolonged exposure (ranging from 30 to 60 min) can lead to protein denaturation, which in turn causes enzyme inactivation, mitochondrial injury, and varying degrees of tissue necrosis. As the temperature increases, the exposure time required to cause tissue injury decreases while the severity of injury intensifies. When temperatures exceed 60 °C, a mere few seconds of exposure result in immediate and complete coagulation necrosis. At 100 °C, the boiling point of water, tissues undergo rapid vaporization, which almost instantaneously leads to the formation of steam vacuoles, tissue desiccation, and charring. As temperatures continue to increase, exceeding 300 °C, smoke generation and tissue vaporization occur, potentially resulting in carbonization and cavitation [8-10].",

The electrical current flowing through the system is concentrated at the electrode tip due to the significant difference in surface area between the tip and the grounding pad. As the current encounters resistance in the surrounding tissue, water molecules and other ions within the tissue rapidly oscillate to align with the alternating currents. This ionic agitation generates friction, leading to heat production through a process known as resistive heating [14]."

A similar modification, known as 'cooled-wet tip RFA,' infuses saline in an open technique, allowing saline to enter the tumor [16, 17]. This maintains a moist environment, as the water molecules are the necessary substrate for ionic agitation.

Finally, finding the optimal temperature can be challenging as the effects occur around the electrode and propagate outward [9]. Although temperatures above 100 °C might seem desirable for complete tissue destruction, the effects of vaporization should not be overlooked. As mentioned previously, vaporization produces steam, which acts as an insulator, hindering further heat transfer from the source to the peripheral areas of the tumor. Additionally, carbonization can occur at high temperatures, which increases the impedance of the electrical field in radiofrequency applications, consequently reducing the zone of effect [7]."

This discovery not only revolutionized home cooking but also unveiled a plethora of possibilities for medical therapeutics.

This can happen due to significant localized thermal buildup within the antenna since the heat is generated in the tissue and not through a current. Cooled tip technology, like those in RFA catheters, has been integrated into MWA antennas to prevent this issue from occurring. Additionally, because the heating process is volumetric, heat does not dissipate into the surrounding tissue as all of the tissue is heated uniformly [28]. Therefore, when treating central structures with large vessels, caution should be used."

This cryoprobe consisted of a vacuuminsulated cannula containing liquid nitrogen at a temperature of - 196 °C. A non-insulated tip enabled the evaporation of the liquid nitrogen, which resulted in heat absorption from the adjacent tissue. The vaporized nitrogen gas was then expelled through a vent located at the distal end of the cannula.

Like MWA and RFA, the maximum tumor diameter emerged as the most significant predictive factor. Tumors with a diameter exceeding 3 cm presented a higher risk of progression [56]. For oligometastatic disease, two studies are often reported. In 2015, the ECLIPSE trial investigated 40 patients with 60 lung metastases treated via CA, monitored for a minimum of 12 months. This study implemented rigorous eligibility requirements. Local tumor control rates were reported 96.6% and 94.2% at 6 months and 12 months, respectively. The 1-year OS rate was 97.5% [57]. The larger 'SOLSTICE' trial-a multicenter, phase II, prospective, uncontrolled study yielded compelling results in OS rates and local tumor efficacy. Across a cohort of 128 patients with 244 lung metastases undergoing CA, 12-month OS rate was 97.6% (95% CI, 92.6-99.2), with a robust 24-month OS rate of 86.6% (95% CI, 78.7-91.7). Concurrently, local tumor control rate was 85.1% at 12 months (172 out of 202) and 77.2% at 24 months (139 out of 180). Secondary local recurrence-free response following a subsequent cryoablation for recurring tumors exhibited an improvement, with 91.1% (184 out of 202) at 12 months and 84.4% (152 out of 180) at 24 months. This data underscores the potential therapeutic utility of cryoablation in managing metastatic lung tumors [58]. Similar results may be achievable via transbronchial approach."

Procedure considerations are similar between percutaneous and bronchoscopic approaches. However, there are nuances to consider, as the optimal technique is determined by IGTA modality, tumor size, location, and individual patient factors (comorbid conditions). Regardless the IGTA modality, CT imaging should be used in preprocedural phase to assist with ablation catheter placement, in intraprocedural phase to assess treatment zone formation, and in postprocedural phase to evaluate for post-ablation complications. There are three distinct forms of this technology: conventional computed tomography-guided technique (CCT), CT-fluoroscopy-guided technique (CTF),"

IGTA similar to Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) but unlike resection applies energy directly to the in situ tumor without removal, making thorough imaging follow-up essential to evaluate treatment effectiveness and detect early recurrence. The post-ablation imaging appearance varies depending on the modality, with RFA and MWA often resulting in tumor size reduction and the formation of concentric rings around the tumor, while cryoablation typically leaves tumor size unchanged. A recommended follow-up schedule after percutaneous IGTA is as follows: the first Chest CT scan is conducted around 1 month post-IGTA. At this point, a mass-like consolidation is expected at the treated tumor site. Over time, the ablation zone is expected to shrink, and patients are advised to undergo contrast-enhanced chest CT every 3 months for the first year, semi-annually in the second year, and annually thereafter. Residual or recurrent disease is most common within 6-12 months post-IGTA, and early detection is critical as small tumors can be effectively treated with repeat IGTA. Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG PET/CT) can also be employed to evaluate the ablation zone for tumors that exhibited focal FDG/CT uptake before ablation [38] (Table 5).",

Additionally, the stage of the disease warrants consideration, given that percutaneous ablative therapies have been shown to be effective for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)) and oligometastatic disease, conditions that are particularly responsive to localized treatments like ablation.

For instance, small central lesions, otherwise requiring a lobectomy if treated surgically, may alternatively be addressed through IGTA or radiation therapy. While radiation therapy is typically less morbid than IGTA in the short term, it might compromise more lung parenchyma due to the radiation dose affecting adjacent tissues. Conversely, IGTA, while preserving lung parenchyma, may not adequately address > 3 cm lesions as shown by increased local recurrence rate with these larger lesions. Hence, radiation or surgery is a more appropriate therapy modality. Furthermore, in cases of multiple lesions, a multimodal approach incorporating different treatment modalities in a strategic manner could offer significant benefits, thus emphasizing the necessity of a comprehensive, collaborative approach in patient selection and treatment planning [38] (Table 6).",

While RFA, MWA, and CA have been employed to treat lung cancer via percutaneous approach, interpreting the data is challenging due to variations in tumor type (metastatic vs. primary lung), rates of biopsy confirmation, follow-up periods, and techniques. A poignant illustration of this is a 2019 meta-analysis of 12 studies involving 985 patients, where MWA was used. Every study was found to have significant methodological weaknesses, with only four addressing missing data in their findings. Moreover, most studies had a follow-up period of fewer than 2 years [64]."

            "text": "While RFA remains a viable option for treating many tumors, MWA is increasingly showing numerous advantages over RFA. It is rapidly becoming the treatment of choice for many cancers due to its ability to generate larger and more uniform ablation zones and reduced complications associated with charring and heat sink effect. In the lung, RFA is particularly disadvantaged due to the high tissue impedance of aerated lung, resulting in decreased conductivity. Additionally, the highly vascular nature of lung tissue exacerbates the problems of heat-sink, limiting RFA's effectiveness. However, even with microwave ablation, several lung properties can affect the ability to create reliable ablation fields. First, the heat-sink effect, which is less problematic with microwaves compared to RFA, can still be troublesome due to the extensive pulmonary blood flow and intertwined networks of pulmonary arterioles, venules, and capillaries. The act of ventilation also introduces a heat-sink effect as heat can dissipate from the intended ablation site simply through the process of breathing [65]."

Air also acts as an insulator, reducing thermal conductivity. Although these differences might initially seem beneficial in confining ablation to the intended tumor site-since the surrounding normal lung tissue is less likely to incur thermal injury, lung cancers often grow in lepidic patterns with ground-glass components and irregular shapes, making this assumption questionable [24, 68, 69]."

Yet, the technology for zone prediction receives FDA clearance based on ex vivo heating experiments [70]. While this appears to correlate well with actual ablation zones in the liver, the nature of the inflated lung is different, and the software might provide a false sense of accuracy [71]. Available studies so far have shown a poor correlation of ablation zone prediction with the actual ablation zone in the lung [69]. For example, a 2021 study of pulmonary tumor ablation prior to planned resection showed that the ablation zone predicted by the software was, on average, 57.7% smaller than planned [68]."

This could be caused by the inflammatory response as well as tumor bleeding resulting from the ablation [73]."

All 7 patients had high levels of PTH in at least 1 specimen. It is concluded that the measurement of high concentrations of PTH in the aspirate from a cervical or mediastinal mass, with CT documentation of needle position, provides absolute localization of parathyroid masses."

Indications for this procedure were recurrence of parathyroid tumors after previous subtotal surgery, high surgical risk, or refusal of surgery. Significant volume reductions were recorded for the larger glands; in the smaller ones, structural changes were observed as well. Clinical and biochemical therapeutic effects were obtained in most cases of single hyperplastic glands treated. Percutaneous alcoholic ablation of enlarged parathyroid glands can be used in cases of secondary hyperparathyroidism when surgery is contraindicated or problematic; it can also improve responsiveness to medical therapy, delaying the need for surgery."

        "abstract": "Fourteen lesions (nine hepatocellular carcinomas, four hepatic metastases from gastric carcinoma, and one peritoneal metastasis from transitional cell carcinoma) in 12 patients were treated with percutaneous injection of 95% ethyl alcohol under guidance with ultrasound. Requirements for this procedure included inadequate response to conventional treatment or refusal of surgery, easy identification of the tumor with sonography, and a tumor diameter less than 4 cm. Three to nine administrations (75 in all) were performed for each lesion according to its size and to the results of the fine needle biopsy. All lesions had posttreatment sonographic structural changes of fibronecrotic degeneration. All lesions less than 3.2 cm in diameter (11 cases) that underwent the final fine needle biopsy were negative for malignant cells and had volume reductions up to 100%. No biochemical changes or untoward clinical sequelae were detected. Percutaneous intratumoral alcohol injection is inexpensive, easy to perform, and potentially valuable in the treatment of selected small neoplastic lesions of the liver and abdomen."

The primary cancer was colorectal adenocarcinoma (seven patients), adenocarcinoma of the stomach (four patients), abdominal leiomyosarcoma (one patient), gastrinoma of unknown origin (one patient), and bronchial carcinoid (one patient). The indicators of therapeutic efficacy were US, computed tomography, fine-needle biopsy, and serologic markers. No complications occurred after a total of 175 treatment sessions. Complete response was obtained in 11 lesions, nine of which were less than 2 cm in diameter, and in all endocrine metastases (four lesions in two patients) with a maximum, recurrence-free follow-up of 38 months. Carcinoembryonic antigen values decreased in all patients but one for a 2-6-month period. The natural course of metastatic disease strictly limits the applicability of PEI, a local treatment. Single, metachronous, nonoperable metastasis of adenocarcinoma and endocrine metastases seem to be the only indications for PEI."

The authors briefly describe the historical role of hyperthermia in cancer care as well as modern expectations based on technological advancements. In particular, the article focuses on the role of hyperthermia for cancers that do not have other, more effective treatments."

From the ablation of small, unresectable tumours to experimental therapies, percutaneous radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, cryoablation and irreversible electroporation have an increasing role in the treatment of solid neoplasms. This Opinion article examines the mechanisms of tumour cell death that are induced by the most common thermoablative techniques and discusses the rapidly developing areas of research in the field, including combinatorial ablation and immunotherapy, synergy with conventional chemotherapy and radiation, and the development of a new ablation modality in irreversible electroporation."

Increasing interest has been accompanied by continual advances in energy delivery, application technique, and therapeutic combinations with the intent to improve the efficacy and/or specificity of ablative therapies. This review outlines clinical percutaneous tumor ablation technology, detailing the science, devices, techniques, technical obstacles, current trends, and future goals in percutaneous tumor ablation. Methods such as chemical ablation, cryoablation, high-temperature ablation (radiofrequency, microwave, laser, and ultrasound), and irreversible electroporation will be discussed. Advances in technique will also be covered, including combination therapies, tissue property modulation, and the role of computer modeling for treatment optimization."

        "abstract": "As the modern era of cryosurgery began in the mid 1960s, the basic features of cryosurgical technique were established as rapid freezing, slow thawing, and repetition of the freeze-thaw cycle. Since then, new applications of cryosurgery have caused numerous investigations on the mechanism of injury in cryosurgery with the intent to better define appropriate or optimal temperature-time dosimetry of the freeze-thaw cycles. A diversity of opinion has become evident on some aspects of technique, but the basic tenets of cryosurgery remain unchanged. All the parts of the freeze-thaw cycle can cause tissue injury. The cooling rate should be as fast as possible, but it is not as critical as other factors. The coldest tissue temperature is the prime factor in cell death and this should be -50 degreesC in neoplastic tissue. The optimal duration of freezing is not known, but prolonged freezing increases tissue destruction. The thawing rate is a prime destructive factor and it should be as slow as possible. Repetition of the freeze-thaw cycle is well known to be an important factor in effective therapy. A prime need in cryosurgical research is related to the periphery of the cryosurgical lesion where some cells die and others live. Adjunctive therapy should influence the fate of cells in this region and increase the efficacy of cryosurgical techniques."

The efficacy of the electrode was evaluated in both ex vivo and in vivo liver RFA under both low and high power output levels. The ablation volume created with the \"cooled-wet\" electrode appeared to be much larger than that reported up to now with the use of other monopolar electrodes. The mechanisms on how this device optimizes the RF energy delivery are also discussed."

The basic microwave ablation system contains many of the same components as a radiofrequency ablation system: a generator, a power distribution system, and an interstitial applicator. This article attempts to provide an overview of each of these components, outline their functions and roles, and provide some insight into what every potential microwave ablation user should know about systems in development."

Ablation has been performed with several modalities including ethanol ablation, laser ablation, cryoablation, and radiofrequency ablation. Microwave technology is a new thermal ablation technique for different types of tumors, providing all the benefits of radiofrequency and substantial advantages. Microwave ablation has been applied to liver, lung, kidney and more rarely to bone, pancreas and adrenal glands. Preliminary works show that microwave ablation may be a viable alternative to other ablation techniques in selected patients. However further studies are necessary to confirm short- and long-term effectiveness of the methods and to compare it with other ablative techniques, especially RF."

        "abstract": "Hepatocellular cancer ranks fifth among cancers and is related to chronic viral hepatitis, alcohol abuse, steatohepatitis and liver autoimmunity. Surgical resection and orthotopic liver transplantation have curative potential, but fewer than 20% of patients are suitable candidates. Interventional treatments are offered to the vast majority of patients. Radiofrequency (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA) are among the therapeutic modalities, with similar indications which include the presence of up to three lesions, smaller than 3 cm in size, and the absence of extrahepatic disease. The therapeutic effect of both methods relies on thermal injury, but MWA uses an electromagnetic field as opposed to electrical current used in RFA. Unlike MWA, the effect of RFA is partially limited by the heat-sink effect and increased impedance of the ablated tissue. Compared with RFA, MWA attains a more predictable ablation zone, permits simultaneous treatment of multiple lesions, and achieves larger coagulation volumes in a shorter procedural time. Major complications of both methods are comparable and infrequent (approximately 2%-3%), and they include haemorrhage, infection/abscess, visceral organ injury, liver failure, and pneumothorax. RFA may incur the additional complication of skin burns. Nevertheless, there is no compelling evidence for differences in clinical outcomes, including local recurrence rates and survival."

        "abstract": "Microwave (MW) ablation has emerged as a minimally invasive therapeutic modality and is in clinical use for treatment of unresectable tumors and cardiac arrhythmias, neuromodulation, endometrial ablation, and other applications. Components of image-guided MW ablation systems include high-power MW sources, ablation applicators that deliver power from the generator to the target tissue, cooling systems, energy-delivery control algorithms, and imaging guidance systems tailored to specific clinical indications. The applicator incorporates a MW antenna that radiates MW power into the surrounding tissue. A variety of antenna designs have been developed for MW ablation with the objective of efficiently transferring MW power to tissue, with a radiation pattern well matched to the size and shape of the targeted tissue. Here, we survey advances in percutaneous, endocavitary, and endoscopic antenna designs as an integral element of MW ablation applicators for a diverse set of clinical applications."

        "abstract": "Microwave ablation uses dielectric hysteresis to produce direct volume heating of tissue. Microwaves are capable of propagating through many tissue types, even those with high impedance such as lung or bone, with less susceptibility to \"heat-sink\" effects along vessels. Microwaves are highly conducive to the use of multiple applicators, showing the synergy seen with other energies, but also the potential capability for phasing of the electromagnetic field. As a result, larger, more customizable ablation zones may be created in less time. Although multiple microwave ablation systems are currently available, further study and continued development are needed."

        "abstract": "The use of freezing temperatures for the therapeutic destruction of tissue began in England in 1845-51 when James Arnott described the use of iced salt solutions (about-20 degrees C) to freeze advanced cancers in accessible sites, producing reduction in tumor size and amelioration of pain. Improved freezing techniques were possible early in the 1990s when solidified carbon dioxide came into use and later when liquid nitrogen and nitrous oxide became available. Nevertheless, cryotherapy was a minor technique, used only for the accessible lesions of skin and mucosa. With the development of modern cryosurgical apparatus by Cooper in 1961, a resurgence of interest in cryosurgery was initiated and techniques for diverse clinical conditions, including visceral cancer, evolved, After the initial widespread clinical trials matured in the 1970s, some applications of the technique fell into disuse while others became standard treatment. Late in the 1980s, further improvements in apparatus and imaging techniques have permitted increased clinical use in neoplastic disease, including visceral cancer."

Cryoablation causes cellular damage, death, and necrosis of tissues by direct mechanisms, which cause cold-induced injury to cells, and indirect mechanisms, which cause changes to the cellular microenvironment and impair tissue viability. Cellular injury, both indirect and direct, can be influenced by four factors: cooling rate, target temperature, time at target temperature, and thawing rate. In this review, the authors describe the mechanisms of cellular injury that occur with cryoablation, the major advantages and disadvantages of cryoablation compared with other thermal ablation techniques, and the current commercially available cryoablation ablation systems."

The range of tissue temperatures produced was from -15 to -50 degrees C. The extent of destruction was evaluated by skin biopsies 3 days after cold injury. In single, short freezing/thawing cycles, the temperature reached in the tissue was the prime factor in cell death. Longer freezing time and slow thawing were also important lethal factors which increased destruction of cells. Cooling rate, whether slow or fast, made little difference in the outcome. The experiments suggested that present-day, commonly employed cryosurgical techniques, which feature fast cooling, slow thawing, and repetition of the freeze/thaw cycle, should be modified by the use of maintenance of the tissue in the frozen state for several minutes and slow thawing. Thawing should be complete before freezing is repeated. These modifications in technique will maximize tissue destruction, an important consideration in cancer cryosurgery."

        "abstract": "The detection of peripheral lung nodules is increasing because of the expanded use of CT imaging and implementation of lung cancer screening recommendations. Although surgical resection of malignant nodules remains the treatment modality of choice at present, many patients are not surgical candidates, thus prompting the need for other therapeutic options. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) and percutaneous thermal ablation are emerging as viable alternatives to surgical resection. For safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness purposes, however, alternative bronchoscopic methods for treatment of peripheral lung cancer are currently under active exploration. We searched the Cochrane Library and MEDLINE from 1990 to 2015 to provide the most comprehensive review of bronchoscopic treatment of malignant lung nodules. We used the following search terms: bronchoscopy, lung nodule, peripheral lung lesion, and bronchoscopic treatment. We focused on peripheral pulmonary nodules that are confirmed or highly likely to be malignant. Seventy-one articles were included in this narrative review. We have provided an overview of advanced bronchoscopic modalities that have been used or are under active investigation for definitive treatment of malignant pulmonary nodules. We have concisely discussed the use of direct intratumoral chemotherapy or gene therapies, transbronchial brachytherapy, bronchoscopy-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA), placement of markers to guide real time-radiation and surgery, cryotherapy, and photodynamic therapy. We have also briefly reported on emerging technologies such as vapor ablation of lung parenchyma for lung cancers. Advances in bronchoscopic therapy will bring additional treatment options to patients with peripheral lung malignancies, with putative advantages over other minimally invasive modalities."

The advantages and disadvantages of percutaneous thermal ablation compared with surgical resection and stereotactic body radiotherapy are summarized. Principles of radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, and cryoablation, as well as the emerging use of transbronchial thermal ablation, are described. Specific considerations are presented regarding the role of thermal ablation for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), multifocal primary NSCLC, pulmonary metastases, salvage of recurrent NSCLC after surgery or radiation, and pain palliation for tumors involving the chest wall. Recent changes to professional society guidelines regarding the role of thermal ablation in the lung, including for treatment of oligometastatic disease, are highlighted. Finally, recommendations are provided for imaging follow-up after thermal ablation of lung tumors, accompanied by examples of expected postoperative findings and patterns of disease recurrence."

Normal lungs from sheep were used (n=6). Internal cooled-RFA and standard noncooled-RFA were set to assess the most suitable RFA conditions, such as power output, flow rate and ablation time. Internal cooled-RFA was then applied under the most optimal conditions of power output and flow rate for 15, 30, 60 and 120 s, and two water temperatures either room temperature (RT) water or cold water. Criteria for the most appropriate conditions were set over 15 s of ablation time and 50 degrees C of the tip's temperature. Internal cooled-RFA had no complications. Standard noncooled-RFA was complicated with bronchial bleeding after RFA. On the basis of the histological findings, average temperature and average output, the most appropriate conditions of the cooled-RFA were a power output of 30 W and flow rate of 30 or 40 mL.min(-1). The cooled-RFA using cold water caused a smaller, more discrete, lesion compared with that using RT water. Bronchoscopy-guided internal cooled-radiofrequency ablation was an effective, safe and feasible procedure that could become a potential therapeutic tool in managing lung pathology."

Two patients with nonsurgical stage IA peripheral lung cancer and 1 with lung metastasis underwent treatment with flexible catheter RFA utilizing navigation bronchoscopy. Chest computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) were performed before and after RFA to assess the ablation response of the patients. One patient's tumor had no prior PET uptake and therefore no follow-up PET was obtained. The first and the third patient obtained partial response to RFA, and the second patient obtained complete response 3 months after RFA. The first patient developed progressive disease 6 months after RFA. The second and the third patient achieved one-year progression-free survival. No significant complications occurred in the 3 patients. Navigation bronchoscopy-guided RFA is a safe and feasible procedure for poor surgical candidates with stage IA lung cancer or lung metastasis."

Available ablative modalities include radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, and cryoablation. Currently, there are no sufficiently representative studies to determine significant differences between the results of these techniques. However, a common feature among them is their excellent tolerance with very few complications. For optimal treatment, radiologists must carefully select the patients to be treated, perform a refined ablative technique, and have a detailed knowledge of the radiological features following lung ablation. Although no randomized studies comparing image-guided percutaneous lung ablation with surgery or stereotactic radiation therapy are available, the current literature demonstrates equivalent survival rates. This review will discuss image-guided percutaneous lung ablation features, including available modalities, approved indications, possible complications, published results, and future applications."

A total of 35 experts met to address several questions on non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in each of four areas: pathology and molecular biomarkers, first-line/second and further lines of treatment in advanced disease, early-stage disease and locally advanced disease. For each question, recommendations were made including reference to the grade of recommendation and level of evidence. This consensus paper focuses on locally advanced disease."

Despite promising results in nonoperative patients with NSCLC and pulmonary metastatic disease, thermal ablation appears to be limited by large tumor size and proximity to large vessels. This article discusses the particular challenges of performing thermal ablation in aerated lung tissue and reviews important considerations in performing ablation including treatment complications and imaging follow-up. The article compares and contrasts the three major thermal ablation modalities: radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, and cryoablation."

        "abstract": "Microwave ablation systems allow for performing tumoral destruction in oncology. The objective of this study was to assess the early response and reliability of the microwave ablation zone size at one month for liver, kidney and lung lesions, as compared to the manufacturer's charts. Patients who underwent microwave ablation with the Emprint<sup>TM</sup> ablation system for liver, kidney and lung lesions between June 2016 and June 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Local response and ablation zone size (major, <i>L</i>, and minor, <i>l</i>, axes) were evaluated on the one-month follow-up imaging. Results were compared to the manufacturers' charts using the Bland-Altman analysis. Fifty-five patients (mean age 68 &#xb1; 11 years; 95 lesions) were included. The one-month complete response was 94%. Liver ablations showed a good agreement with subtle, smaller ablation zones (<i>L</i>: -2 &#xb1; 5.7 mm; <i>l</i>: -5.2 &#xb1; 5.6 mm). Kidney ablations showed a moderate agreement with larger ablations for L (<i>L</i>: 8.69 &#xb1; 7.94 mm; <i>l</i>: 0.36 &#xb1; 4.77 mm). Lung ablations showed a moderate agreement, with smaller ablations for l (<i>L</i>: -5.45 &#xb1; 4.5 mm; <i>l</i>: -9.32 &#xb1; 4.72 mm). With 94% of early complete responses, the system showed reliable ablations for liver lesions, but larger ablations for kidney lesions, and smaller for lung lesions."

        "abstract": "Imaging-guided percutaneous ablative treatments, such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA), cryoablation and microwave ablation (MWA), have been developed for the treatment of unresectable primary and secondary lung tumors in patients with advanced-stage disease or comorbidities contraindicating surgery. Among these therapies, MWA has recently shown promising results in the treatment of pulmonary neoplasms. The potential advantages of MWA over RFA include faster ablation times, higher intra-tumoral temperatures, larger ablation zones and lower susceptibility to the heat sink effect, resulting in greater efficacy in proximity to vascular structures. Despite encouraging results supporting its efficacy, there is a relative paucity of data in the literature regarding the role of computer tomography (CT) to monitor MWA-treated lesions, and the CT appearance of their morphologic evolution and complications. For both interventional and non-interventional radiologists, it is crucial to be familiar with the CT features of such treated lesions in order to detect incomplete therapy or recurrent disease at early stage, as well as to recognize initial signs of complications. The aim of this pictorial essay is to describe the typical CT features during follow-up of lung lesions treated with percutaneous MWA and how to interpret and differentiate them from other radiological findings, such as recurrence and complications, that are commonly encountered in this setting."

Currently, no standard follow-up imaging protocol has been established or uniformly accepted.

This review elaborates on the imaging findings following thermal ablation, both heat- and cold-based, of nonresectable pulmonary malignancies."

        "abstract": "At present, minimally invasive surgery is one of the primary strategies for the treatment of malignant pulmonary tumors. Although, there are some comparative studies between microwave ablation and radiofrequency for the treatment of malignant pulmonary tumors, there are few studies that have investigated the comparison between microwave ablation and cryoablation. The aim of the study was to retrospectively compare the efficacy and complications of microwave ablation (MWA) and cryoablation in the treatment of malignant pulmonary tumors. A retrospective analysis was performed on 48 patients with malignant lung tumors treated with MWA or cryoablation in The Third Hospital of Mianyang and The Affiliated Hospital of North Sichuan Medical College between June 2014 and June 2018. Of these patients, 29 received MWA and 19 received cryoablation. Intraprocedural pain was evaluated by using the visual analog scale (VAS). The intraprocedural pain, response rates, overall survival (OS) and complications rates were compared between the MWA group and cryoablation group. The results showed that the patients in the MWA group experienced more pain than those in cryoablation group as the MWA group VAS scores were much higher than those in cryoablation group (P&lt;0.001). The overall response rate of the MWA group [21/29 (72.41%)] was not significantly different from the cryoablation group [14/19 (73.68%)] (P=0.92). The 6-, 12-, 24- and 36-month OS rates in the MWA group and cryoablation group were 92.72, 81.28, 64.54 and 54.91%, and 94.07, 81.13, 57.33 and 43.04%, respectively. No significant differences were found in the OS rate between the two groups (P=0.79). The complication rates in the MWA and cryoablation groups were 34.48 and 36.84%, respectively; there was no significant difference between the two groups (P=0.59). No patients died during the perioperative period. Cryoablation had a similar therapeutic effect compared with MWA in the treatment of pulmonary malignant tumors, but was associated with less pain."

          "Although the effects of thermal ablation can vary based on the specific type of tissue (i.e., physical and biological properties) and the ablation technique being employed, significant tissue changes typically do not occur below 42 °C. At temperatures above 42 °C, prolonged exposure (ranging from 30 to 60 min) can lead to protein denaturation, which in turn causes enzyme inactivation, mitochondrial injury, and varying degrees of tissue necrosis. As the temperature increases, the exposure time required to cause tissue injury decreases while the severity of injury intensifies. When temperatures exceed 60 °C, a mere few seconds of exposure result in immediate and complete coagulation necrosis. At 100 °C, the boiling point of water, tissues undergo rapid vaporization, which almost instantaneously leads to the formation of steam vacuoles, tissue desiccation, and charring. As temperatures continue to increase, exceeding 300 °C, smoke generation and tissue vaporization occur, potentially resulting in carbonization and cavitation [8-10]."

Recent reports of transbronchial ablation bring excitement and the need for further developments.

It is essential for physicians planning to use ablation therapies to understand the relationship between thermal exposure (encompassing temperature and duration of exposure) and resultant thermal damage. Heat injury occurs in two distinct phases: direct thermal effects followed by indirect thermal effects. These indirect effects involve triggering an immune response due to the release of various inflammatory mediators at the injury site, leading to further destruction of malignant cells.",

As a result, three somewhat distinct zones of tissue injury develop around the delivery device, which correlates with the temperature reached in the respective tissue, as described in Table 1. The area in closest proximity to the applicator, where the highest temperatures are reached, is known as the zone of central necrosis or charring zone. Surrounding this central necrosis zone is the coagulation zone, corresponding to areas with temperatures between 60 and 100 °C where denatured proteins result in complete necrosis. Finally, at the outer rim of the coagulation zone is a surrounding area of tissue that is partially affected by heat and is variably referred to as the congestion zone [11]. This zone exhibits partial necrosis and is often associated with hyperemia, edema, or inflammation.",
          "rimarily for cutting and coagulating surface tissue. In a monopolar RFA system, an RF generator is connected to an electrode and a dispersive grounding pad, forming a closed-loop circuit. This system operates with alternating currents, typically within the frequency range of 350 to 500 kHz. The electrical current flowing through the system is concentrated at the electrode tip due to the significant difference in surface area between the tip and the grounding pad. As the current encounters resistance in the surrounding tissue, water molecules and other ions within the tissue rapidly oscillate to align with the alternating currents. This ionic agitation generates friction, leading to heat production through a process known as resistive heating [14].",

As with all electrical circuits, energy seeks the path of least resistance and grounds itself, often resulting in irregular ablation zones. Finally, finding the optimal temperature can be challenging as the effects occur around the electrode and propagate outward [9]. Although temperatures above 100 °C might seem desirable for complete tissue destruction, the effects of vaporization should not be overlooked. As mentioned previously, vaporization produces steam, which acts as an insulator, hindering further heat transfer from the source to the peripheral areas of the tumor. Additionally, carbonization can occur at high temperatures, which increases the impedance of the electrical field in radiofrequency applications, consequently reducing the zone of effect [7].",

Local recurrence was reported in 36.2% of cases [55]. A more contemporary retrospective analysis of 25 stage I Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with CA showed OS rates of 100% after one year and 63% after three years. However, local control rates were lower than those observed with microwave ablation (MWA) or radiofrequency ablation (RFA), at 71% after one year and 37% after 3 years. Like MWA and RFA, the maximum tumor diameter emerged as the most significant predictive factor. Tumors with a diameter exceeding 3 cm presented a higher risk of progression [56]. For oligometastatic disease, two studies are often reported. In 2015, the ECLIPSE trial investigated 40 patients with 60 lung metastases treated via CA, monitored for a minimum of 12 months. This study implemented rigorous eligibility requirements. Local tumor control rates were reported 96.6% and 94.2% at 6 months and 12 months, respectively. The 1-year OS rate was 97.5% [57]. The larger 'SOLSTICE' trial-a multicenter, phase II, prospective, uncontrolled study yielded compelling results in OS rates and local tumor efficacy. Across a cohort of 128 patients with 244 lung metastases undergoing CA, 12-month OS rate was 97.6% (95% CI, 92.6-99.2), with a robust 24-month OS rate of 86.6% (95% CI, 78.7-91.7). Concurrently, local tumor control rate was 85.1% at 12 months (172 out of 202) and 77.2% at 24 months (139 out of 180). Secondary local recurrence-free response following a subsequent cryoablation for recurring tumors exhibited an improvement, with 91.1% (184 out of 202) at 12 months and 84.4% (152 out of 180) at 24 months.

          "Although the effects of thermal ablation can vary based on the specific type of tissue (i.e., physical and biological properties) and the ablation technique being employed, significant tissue changes typically do not occur below 42 °C. At temperatures above 42 °C, prolonged exposure (ranging from 30 to 60 min) can lead to protein denaturation, which in turn causes enzyme inactivation, mitochondrial injury, and varying degrees of tissue necrosis. As the temperature increases, the exposure time required to cause tissue injury decreases while the severity of injury intensifies. When temperatures exceed 60 °C, a mere few seconds of exposure result in immediate and complete coagulation necrosis. At 100 °C, the boiling point of water, tissues undergo rapid vaporization, which almost instantaneously leads to the formation of steam vacuoles, tissue desiccation, and charring. As temperatures continue to increase, exceeding 300 °C, smoke generation and tissue vaporization occur, potentially resulting in carbonization and cavitation [8-10]."

Recent reports of transbronchial ablation bring excitement and the need for further developments.

It is essential for physicians planning to use ablation therapies to understand the relationship between thermal exposure (encompassing temperature and duration of exposure) and resultant thermal damage.

These indirect effects involve triggering an immune response due to the release of various inflammatory mediators at the injury site, leading to further destruction of malignant cells.",

As a result, three somewhat distinct zones of tissue injury develop around the delivery device, which correlates with the temperature reached in the respective tissue, as described in Table 1. The area in closest proximity to the applicator, where the highest temperatures are reached, is known as the zone of central necrosis or charring zone. Surrounding this central necrosis zone is the coagulation zone, corresponding to areas with temperatures between 60 and 100 °C where denatured proteins result in complete necrosis. Finally, at the outer rim of the coagulation zone is a surrounding area of tissue that is partially affected by heat and is variably referred to as the congestion zone [11]. This zone exhibits partial necrosis and is often associated with hyperemia, edema, or inflammation.",

This system operates with alternating currents, typically within the frequency range of 350 to 500 kHz. The electrical current flowing through the system is concentrated at the electrode tip due to the significant difference in surface area between the tip and the grounding pad. As the current encounters resistance in the surrounding tissue, water molecules and other ions within the tissue rapidly oscillate to align with the alternating currents. This ionic agitation generates friction, leading to heat production through a process known as resistive heating [14].",

As with all electrical circuits, energy seeks the path of least resistance and grounds itself, often resulting in irregular ablation zones. Finally, finding the optimal temperature can be challenging as the effects occur around the electrode and propagate outward [9]. Although temperatures above 100 °C might seem desirable for complete tissue destruction, the effects of vaporization should not be overlooked. As mentioned previously, vaporization produces steam, which acts as an insulator, hindering further heat transfer from the source to the peripheral areas of the tumor. Additionally, carbonization can occur at high temperatures, which increases the impedance of the electrical field in radiofrequency applications, consequently reducing the zone of effect [7].",

Local recurrence was reported in 36.2% of cases [55]. A more contemporary retrospective analysis of 25 stage I Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with CA showed OS rates of 100% after one year and 63% after three years. However, local control rates were lower than those observed with microwave ablation (MWA) or radiofrequency ablation (RFA), at 71% after one year and 37% after 3 years. Like MWA and RFA, the maximum tumor diameter emerged as the most significant predictive factor. Tumors with a diameter exceeding 3 cm presented a higher risk of progression [56]. For oligometastatic disease, two studies are often reported. In 2015, the ECLIPSE trial investigated 40 patients with 60 lung metastases treated via CA, monitored for a minimum of 12 months. This study implemented rigorous eligibility requirements. Local tumor control rates were reported 96.6% and 94.2% at 6 months and 12 months, respectively. The 1-year OS rate was 97.5% [57]. The larger 'SOLSTICE' trial-a multicenter, phase II, prospective, uncontrolled study yielded compelling results in OS rates and local tumor efficacy. Across a cohort of 128 patients with 244 lung metastases undergoing CA, 12-month OS rate was 97.6% (95% CI, 92.6-99.2), with a robust 24-month OS rate of 86.6% (95% CI, 78.7-91.7). Concurrently, local tumor control rate was 85.1% at 12 months (172 out of 202) and 77.2% at 24 months (139 out of 180). Secondary local recurrence-free response following a subsequent cryoablation for recurring tumors exhibited an improvement, with 91.1% (184 out of 202) at 12 months and 84.4% (152 out of 180) at 24 months.

          "Although the effects of thermal ablation can vary based on the specific type of tissue (i.e., physical and biological properties) and the ablation technique being employed, significant tissue changes typically do not occur below 42 °C. At temperatures above 42 °C, prolonged exposure (ranging from 30 to 60 min) can lead to protein denaturation, which in turn causes enzyme inactivation, mitochondrial injury, and varying degrees of tissue necrosis. As the temperature increases, the exposure time required to cause tissue injury decreases while the severity of injury intensifies. When temperatures exceed 60 °C, a mere few seconds of exposure result in immediate and complete coagulation necrosis. At 100 °C, the boiling point of water, tissues undergo rapid vaporization, which almost instantaneously leads to the formation of steam vacuoles, tissue desiccation, and charring. As temperatures continue to increase, exceeding 300 °C, smoke generation and tissue vaporization occur, potentially resulting in carbonization and cavitation [8-10]."

It is essential for physicians planning to use ablation therapies to understand the relationship between thermal exposure (encompassing temperature and duration of exposure) and resultant thermal damage.

These indirect effects involve triggering an immune response due to the release of various inflammatory mediators at the injury site, leading to further destruction of malignant cells.",
          "aximize tissue effects. As a result, three somewhat distinct zones of tissue injury develop around the delivery device, which correlates with the temperature reached in the respective tissue, as described in Table 1. The area in closest proximity to the applicator, where the highest temperatures are reached, is known as the zone of central necrosis or charring zone. Surrounding this central necrosis zone is the coagulation zone, corresponding to areas with temperatures between 60 and 100 °C where denatured proteins result in complete necrosis. Finally, at the outer rim of the coagulation zone is a surrounding area of tissue that is partially affected by heat and is variably referred to as the congestion zone [11]. This zone exhibits partial necrosis and is often associated with hyperemia, edema, or inflammation.",
          "rimarily for cutting and coagulating surface tissue. In a monopolar RFA system, an RF generator is connected to an electrode and a dispersive grounding pad, forming a closed-loop circuit. This system operates with alternating currents, typically within the frequency range of 350 to 500 kHz. The electrical current flowing through the system is concentrated at the electrode tip due to the significant difference in surface area between the tip and the grounding pad. As the current encounters resistance in the surrounding tissue, water molecules and other ions within the tissue rapidly oscillate to align with the alternating currents. This ionic agitation generates friction, leading to heat production through a process known as resistive heating [14].",

As with all electrical circuits, energy seeks the path of least resistance and grounds itself, often resulting in irregular ablation zones. Finally, finding the optimal temperature can be challenging as the effects occur around the electrode and propagate outward [9]. Although temperatures above 100 °C might seem desirable for complete tissue destruction, the effects of vaporization should not be overlooked. As mentioned previously, vaporization produces steam, which acts as an insulator, hindering further heat transfer from the source to the peripheral areas of the tumor. Additionally, carbonization can occur at high temperatures, which increases the impedance of the electrical field in radiofrequency applications, consequently reducing the zone of effect [7].",

Local recurrence was reported in 36.2% of cases [55]. A more contemporary retrospective analysis of 25 stage I Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with CA showed OS rates of 100% after one year and 63% after three years. However, local control rates were lower than those observed with microwave ablation (MWA) or radiofrequency ablation (RFA), at 71% after one year and 37% after 3 years. Like MWA and RFA, the maximum tumor diameter emerged as the most significant predictive factor. Tumors with a diameter exceeding 3 cm presented a higher risk of progression [56]. For oligometastatic disease, two studies are often reported. In 2015, the ECLIPSE trial investigated 40 patients with 60 lung metastases treated via CA, monitored for a minimum of 12 months. This study implemented rigorous eligibility requirements. Local tumor control rates were reported 96.6% and 94.2% at 6 months and 12 months, respectively. The 1-year OS rate was 97.5% [57]. The larger 'SOLSTICE' trial-a multicenter, phase II, prospective, uncontrolled study yielded compelling results in OS rates and local tumor efficacy. Across a cohort of 128 patients with 244 lung metastases undergoing CA, 12-month OS rate was 97.6% (95% CI, 92.6-99.2), with a robust 24-month OS rate of 86.6% (95% CI, 78.7-91.7). Concurrently, local tumor control rate was 85.1% at 12 months (172 out of 202) and 77.2% at 24 months (139 out of 180). Secondary local recurrence-free response following a subsequent cryoablation for recurring tumors exhibited an improvement, with 91.1% (184 out of 202) at 12 months and 84.4% (152 out of 180) at 24 months.

          "Although the effects of thermal ablation can vary based on the specific type of tissue (i.e., physical and biological properties) and the ablation technique being employed, significant tissue changes typically do not occur below 42 °C. At temperatures above 42 °C, prolonged exposure (ranging from 30 to 60 min) can lead to protein denaturation, which in turn causes enzyme inactivation, mitochondrial injury, and varying degrees of tissue necrosis. As the temperature increases, the exposure time required to cause tissue injury decreases while the severity of injury intensifies. When temperatures exceed 60 °C, a mere few seconds of exposure result in immediate and complete coagulation necrosis. At 100 °C, the boiling point of water, tissues undergo rapid vaporization, which almost instantaneously leads to the formation of steam vacuoles, tissue desiccation, and charring. As temperatures continue to increase, exceeding 300 °C, smoke generation and tissue vaporization occur, potentially resulting in carbonization and cavitation [8-10]."

Recent Findings While percutaneous ablation has been part of lung cancer care for over two decades, transbronchial ablation is in its infancy. Recent reports of transbronchial ablation bring excitement and the need for further developments. Summary Transbronchial ablative technologies could soon be a key part of the toolset for interventional pulmonologists.

It is essential for physicians planning to use ablation therapies to understand the relationship between thermal exposure (encompassing temperature and duration of exposure) and resultant thermal damage. Heat injury occurs in two distinct phases: direct thermal effects followed by indirect thermal effects. These indirect effects involve triggering an immune response due to the release of various inflammatory mediators at the injury site, leading to further destruction of malignant cells.",
          "aximize tissue effects. As a result, three somewhat distinct zones of tissue injury develop around the delivery device, which correlates with the temperature reached in the respective tissue, as described in Table 1. The area in closest proximity to the applicator, where the highest temperatures are reached, is known as the zone of central necrosis or charring zone. Surrounding this central necrosis zone is the coagulation zone, corresponding to areas with temperatures between 60 and 100 °C where denatured proteins result in complete necrosis. Finally, at the outer rim of the coagulation zone is a surrounding area of tissue that is partially affected by heat and is variably referred to as the congestion zone [11]. This zone exhibits partial necrosis and is often associated with hyperemia, edema, or inflammation.",
          "rimarily for cutting and coagulating surface tissue. In a monopolar RFA system, an RF generator is connected to an electrode and a dispersive grounding pad, forming a closed-loop circuit. This system operates with alternating currents, typically within the frequency range of 350 to 500 kHz. The electrical current flowing through the system is concentrated at the electrode tip due to the significant difference in surface area between the tip and the grounding pad. As the current encounters resistance in the surrounding tissue, water molecules and other ions within the tissue rapidly oscillate to align with the alternating currents. This ionic agitation generates friction, leading to heat production through a process known as resistive heating [14].",

As with all electrical circuits, energy seeks the path of least resistance and grounds itself, often resulting in irregular ablation zones. Finally, finding the optimal temperature can be challenging as the effects occur around the electrode and propagate outward [9]. Although temperatures above 100 °C might seem desirable for complete tissue destruction, the effects of vaporization should not be overlooked. As mentioned previously, vaporization produces steam, which acts as an insulator, hindering further heat transfer from the source to the peripheral areas of the tumor. Additionally, carbonization can occur at high temperatures, which increases the impedance of the electrical field in radiofrequency applications, consequently reducing the zone of effect [7].",

Local recurrence was reported in 36.2% of cases [55]. A more contemporary retrospective analysis of 25 stage I Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with CA showed OS rates of 100% after one year and 63% after three years. However, local control rates were lower than those observed with microwave ablation (MWA) or radiofrequency ablation (RFA), at 71% after one year and 37% after 3 years. Like MWA and RFA, the maximum tumor diameter emerged as the most significant predictive factor. Tumors with a diameter exceeding 3 cm presented a higher risk of progression [56]. For oligometastatic disease, two studies are often reported. In 2015, the ECLIPSE trial investigated 40 patients with 60 lung metastases treated via CA, monitored for a minimum of 12 months. This study implemented rigorous eligibility requirements. Local tumor control rates were reported 96.6% and 94.2% at 6 months and 12 months, respectively. The 1-year OS rate was 97.5% [57]. The larger 'SOLSTICE' trial-a multicenter, phase II, prospective, uncontrolled study yielded compelling results in OS rates and local tumor efficacy. Across a cohort of 128 patients with 244 lung metastases undergoing CA, 12-month OS rate was 97.6% (95% CI, 92.6-99.2), with a robust 24-month OS rate of 86.6% (95% CI, 78.7-91.7). Concurrently, local tumor control rate was 85.1% at 12 months (172 out of 202) and 77.2% at 24 months (139 out of 180). Secondary local recurrence-free response following a subsequent cryoablation for recurring tumors exhibited an improvement, with 91.1% (184 out of 202) at 12 months and 84.4% (152 out of 180) at 24 months.

          "Although the effects of thermal ablation can vary based on the specific type of tissue (i.e., physical and biological properties) and the ablation technique being employed, significant tissue changes typically do not occur below 42 °C. At temperatures above 42 °C, prolonged exposure (ranging from 30 to 60 min) can lead to protein denaturation, which in turn causes enzyme inactivation, mitochondrial injury, and varying degrees of tissue necrosis. As the temperature increases, the exposure time required to cause tissue injury decreases while the severity of injury intensifies. When temperatures exceed 60 °C, a mere few seconds of exposure result in immediate and complete coagulation necrosis. At 100 °C, the boiling point of water, tissues undergo rapid vaporization, which almost instantaneously leads to the formation of steam vacuoles, tissue desiccation, and charring. As temperatures continue to increase, exceeding 300 °C, smoke generation and tissue vaporization occur, potentially resulting in carbonization and cavitation [8-10]."

Recent reports of transbronchial ablation bring excitement and the need for further developments.

It is essential for physicians planning to use ablation therapies to understand the relationship between thermal exposure (encompassing temperature and duration of exposure) and resultant thermal damage. Heat injury occurs in two distinct phases: direct thermal effects followed by indirect thermal effects. These indirect effects involve triggering an immune response due to the release of various inflammatory mediators at the injury site, leading to further destruction of malignant cells.",

As a result, three somewhat distinct zones of tissue injury develop around the delivery device, which correlates with the temperature reached in the respective tissue, as described in Table 1. The area in closest proximity to the applicator, where the highest temperatures are reached, is known as the zone of central necrosis or charring zone. Surrounding this central necrosis zone is the coagulation zone, corresponding to areas with temperatures between 60 and 100 °C where denatured proteins result in complete necrosis. Finally, at the outer rim of the coagulation zone is a surrounding area of tissue that is partially affected by heat and is variably referred to as the congestion zone [11]. This zone exhibits partial necrosis and is often associated with hyperemia, edema, or inflammation.",
          "rimarily for cutting and coagulating surface tissue. In a monopolar RFA system, an RF generator is connected to an electrode and a dispersive grounding pad, forming a closed-loop circuit. This system operates with alternating currents, typically within the frequency range of 350 to 500 kHz. The electrical current flowing through the system is concentrated at the electrode tip due to the significant difference in surface area between the tip and the grounding pad. As the current encounters resistance in the surrounding tissue, water molecules and other ions within the tissue rapidly oscillate to align with the alternating currents. This ionic agitation generates friction, leading to heat production through a process known as resistive heating [14].",

As with all electrical circuits, energy seeks the path of least resistance and grounds itself, often resulting in irregular ablation zones. Finally, finding the optimal temperature can be challenging as the effects occur around the electrode and propagate outward [9]. Although temperatures above 100 °C might seem desirable for complete tissue destruction, the effects of vaporization should not be overlooked. As mentioned previously, vaporization produces steam, which acts as an insulator, hindering further heat transfer from the source to the peripheral areas of the tumor. Additionally, carbonization can occur at high temperatures, which increases the impedance of the electrical field in radiofrequency applications, consequently reducing the zone of effect [7].",

Local recurrence was reported in 36.2% of cases [55]. A more contemporary retrospective analysis of 25 stage I Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with CA showed OS rates of 100% after one year and 63% after three years. However, local control rates were lower than those observed with microwave ablation (MWA) or radiofrequency ablation (RFA), at 71% after one year and 37% after 3 years. Like MWA and RFA, the maximum tumor diameter emerged as the most significant predictive factor. Tumors with a diameter exceeding 3 cm presented a higher risk of progression [56]. For oligometastatic disease, two studies are often reported. In 2015, the ECLIPSE trial investigated 40 patients with 60 lung metastases treated via CA, monitored for a minimum of 12 months. This study implemented rigorous eligibility requirements. Local tumor control rates were reported 96.6% and 94.2% at 6 months and 12 months, respectively. The 1-year OS rate was 97.5% [57]. The larger 'SOLSTICE' trial-a multicenter, phase II, prospective, uncontrolled study yielded compelling results in OS rates and local tumor efficacy. Across a cohort of 128 patients with 244 lung metastases undergoing CA, 12-month OS rate was 97.6% (95% CI, 92.6-99.2), with a robust 24-month OS rate of 86.6% (95% CI, 78.7-91.7). Concurrently, local tumor control rate was 85.1% at 12 months (172 out of 202) and 77.2% at 24 months (139 out of 180). Secondary local recurrence-free response following a subsequent cryoablation for recurring tumors exhibited an improvement, with 91.1% (184 out of 202) at 12 months and 84.4% (152 out of 180) at 24 months.

          "Although the effects of thermal ablation can vary based on the specific type of tissue (i.e., physical and biological properties) and the ablation technique being employed, significant tissue changes typically do not occur below 42 °C. At temperatures above 42 °C, prolonged exposure (ranging from 30 to 60 min) can lead to protein denaturation, which in turn causes enzyme inactivation, mitochondrial injury, and varying degrees of tissue necrosis. As the temperature increases, the exposure time required to cause tissue injury decreases while the severity of injury intensifies. When temperatures exceed 60 °C, a mere few seconds of exposure result in immediate and complete coagulation necrosis. At 100 °C, the boiling point of water, tissues undergo rapid vaporization, which almost instantaneously leads to the formation of steam vacuoles, tissue desiccation, and charring. As temperatures continue to increase, exceeding 300 °C, smoke generation and tissue vaporization occur, potentially resulting in carbonization and cavitation [8-10]."

As a result, three somewhat distinct zones of tissue injury develop around the delivery device, which correlates with the temperature reached in the respective tissue, as described in Table 1.

Surrounding this central necrosis zone is the coagulation zone, corresponding to areas with temperatures between 60 and 100 °C where denatured proteins result in complete necrosis. Finally, at the outer rim of the coagulation zone is a surrounding area of tissue that is partially affected by heat and is variably referred to as the congestion zone [11].

As mentioned previously, vaporization produces steam, which acts as an insulator, hindering further heat transfer from the source to the peripheral areas of the tumor.

As a result, three somewhat distinct zones of tissue injury develop around the delivery device, which correlates with the temperature reached in the respective tissue, as described in Table 1. The area in closest proximity to the applicator, where the highest temperatures are reached, is known as the zone of central necrosis or charring zone. Surrounding this central necrosis zone is the coagulation zone, corresponding to areas with temperatures between 60 and 100 °C where denatured proteins result in complete necrosis. Finally, at the outer rim of the coagulation zone is a surrounding area of tissue that is partially affected by heat and is variably referred to as the congestion zone [11].

This system operates with alternating currents, typically within the frequency range of 350 to 500 kHz. The electrical current flowing through the system is concentrated at the electrode tip due to the significant difference in surface area between the tip and the grounding pad. As the current encounters resistance in the surrounding tissue, water molecules and other ions within the tissue rapidly oscillate to align with the alternating currents. This ionic agitation generates friction, leading to heat production through a process known as resistive heating [14].",

As with all electrical circuits, energy seeks the path of least resistance and grounds itself, often resulting in irregular ablation zones. Finally, finding the optimal temperature can be challenging as the effects occur around the electrode and propagate outward [9]. Although temperatures above 100 °C might seem desirable for complete tissue destruction, the effects of vaporization should not be overlooked. As mentioned previously, vaporization produces steam, which acts as an insulator, hindering further heat transfer from the source to the peripheral areas of the tumor. Additionally, carbonization can occur at high temperatures, which increases the impedance of the electrical field in radiofrequency applications, consequently reducing the zone of effect [7].",

A more contemporary retrospective analysis of 25 stage I Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with CA showed OS rates of 100% after one year and 63% after three years. However, local control rates were lower than those observed with microwave ablation (MWA) or radiofrequency ablation (RFA), at 71% after one year and 37% after 3 years. Like MWA and RFA, the maximum tumor diameter emerged as the most significant predictive factor. Tumors with a diameter exceeding 3 cm presented a higher risk of progression [56]. For oligometastatic disease, two studies are often reported. In 2015, the ECLIPSE trial investigated 40 patients with 60 lung metastases treated via CA, monitored for a minimum of 12 months. This study implemented rigorous eligibility requirements. Local tumor control rates were reported 96.6% and 94.2% at 6 months and 12 months, respectively. The 1-year OS rate was 97.5% [57]. The larger 'SOLSTICE' trial-a multicenter, phase II, prospective, uncontrolled study yielded compelling results in OS rates and local tumor efficacy. Across a cohort of 128 patients with 244 lung metastases undergoing CA, 12-month OS rate was 97.6% (95% CI, 92.6-99.2), with a robust 24-month OS rate of 86.6% (95% CI, 78.7-91.7).
