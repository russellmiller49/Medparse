There are many indications for tracheostomy placement, such as the need for prolonged mechanical ventilator support, improved clearance of secretions, protection from aspiration, and maintenance of the airway because of sequelae from upper airway obstructions or trauma. In addition, tracheostomy has additional potential benefits over endotracheal tube (ETT) intubation because it decreases the work of breathing, 1 reduces ventilator-associated pneumonia, 2 provides a more secure airway, and permits patient phonation and swallowing. Tracheostomy plays a prominent role in the treatment of prolonged respiratory failure"

His guidelines on the procedure were instrumental in improving procedural safety and outcomes. Subsequent refinements to the procedure and improvements in equipment have resulted in decreased procedure-related morbidity and mortality. 5 In 1957, Sheldon and Pudenz 6 described a Seldinger method of percutaneous tracheostomy placement.

A guidewire is inserted through the anterior tracheal wall; dilation is then performed until the tracheal stoma is large enough to permit insertion of the tracheal cannula. Cannula insertion is generally performed between the second and third tracheal rings, with a suggestion of decreased risk of bleeding when placed above the fourth tracheal ring. 8 Several variations of the procedure have been developed and are in use today."

Before the procedure, the distal tip of the ETT is repositioned within the subglottic space proximal to the intended tracheostomy dilation site. A midline incision is made over the anterior trachea and the pretracheal soft tissue is bluntly dissected with mosquito clamps. The underlying trachea is then identified using a needle and introducer sheath. Flexible bronchoscopic visualization is commonly used to provide endoscopic guidance from within the trachea ( Fig. 2 ). Removal of the needle allows an introduction of a J-shaped guidewire through the introducer sheath into the trachea and directed caudally into the distal airways. The introducer sheath is then removed and dilation of the trachea and soft tissue is performed initially with a short dilator followed by a curved, conical dilator. Special precautions must be taken to ensure proper midline puncture of the anterior trachea wall and introduction of the guidewire and subsequent dilation through the anterior wall while avoiding puncture of the posterior membranous portion of the trachea. A trachestomy tube is loaded onto an introducer dilator and inserted into the trachea over the guidewire through the dilated stoma and secured in place. The use of the single dilator method is theorized to decrease the risk of injury to the posterior tracheal wall and prevent the risk of oxygen desaturation or",

Beiderlinden and colleagues 75 investigated bronchoscopic-guided PDT in patients with hypoxic respiratory failure and did not demonstrate any significant decrease in arterial oxygen levels. This included patients with PEEP greater than 10 cm H2O (mean, 16.7 /C6 4 cm H2O) whose peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) did not decrease during the procedure.

It is possible, however, that the use of bronchoscopic guidance may have minimized the potential loss of PEEP during PDT because of the effect of the bronchoscope on PEEP.

        "abstract": "Tracheotomy is widely performed on ventilator-dependent patients, but its effects on respiratory mechanics have not been studied. We measured the work of breathing (WOB) in eight patients before and after tracheotomy during breathing at three identical levels of pressure support (PS): baseline level (PS-B), PS + 5 cm H2O (PS+5), and PS - 5 cm H2O (PS-5). After the procedure, we also compared the resistive work induced by the patients' endotracheal tubes (ETTs) and by a new tracheotomy cannula in an in vitro bench study. A significant reduction in the WOB was observed after tracheotomy for PS-B (from 0.9 +/- 0.4 to 0.4 +/- 0.2 J/L, p &lt; 0.05), and for PS-5 (1.4 +/- 0.6 to 0.6 +/- 0.3 J/L, p &lt; 0.05), with a near-significant reduction for PS+5 (0.5 +/- 0.5 to 0.2 +/- 0.1 J/L, p = 0.05). A significant reduction was also observed in the pressure-time index of the respiratory muscles (181 +/- 92 to 80 +/- 56 cm H2O. s/min for PS-B, p &lt; 0.05). Resistive and elastic work computed from transpulmonary pressure measurements decreased significantly at PS-B and PS-5. A significant reduction in occlusion pressure and intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was also observed for all conditions, with no significant change in breathing pattern. Three patients had ineffective breathing efforts before tracheotomy, and all had improved synchrony with the ventilator after the procedure. In vitro measurements made with ETTs removed from the patients, with new ETTs, and with the tracheotomy cannula showed that the cannula reduced the resistive work induced by the artificial airway. Part of these results was explained by a slight, subtle reduction of the inner diameter of used ETTs. We conclude that tracheotomy can substantially reduce the mechanical workload of ventilator-dependent patients."

        "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to determine the relationship between tracheotomy and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The study used a retrospective case-control study design based on prospective data. All nontrauma immunocompetent patients, intubated and ventilated for &gt;7 days, were eligible for inclusion in the study. A diagnosis of VAP was based on clinical, radiographical and microbiological criteria. Four matching criteria were used, including duration of mechanical ventilation (MV). The indication and timing of tracheotomy were at the discretion of attending physicians. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine risk factors for VAP in cases (patients with tracheotomy) and controls (patients without tracheotomy). In total, 1,402 patients were eligible for inclusion. Surgical tracheotomy was performed in 226 (16%) patients and matching was successful for 177 (78%). The rate of VAP (22 versus 14 VAP episodes.1,000 MV-days(-1)) was significantly higher in controls than in cases. The rate of VAP after tracheotomy in cases, or after the corresponding day of MV in controls, was also significantly higher in control than in case patients (9.2 versus 4.8 VAP episodes.1,000 MV-days(-1)). In multivariate analysis, neurological failure (odds ratio (95% confidence interval) 2.7 (1.3-5)), antibiotic treatment (2.1 (1.1-3.2)) and tracheotomy (0.18 (0.1-0.3)) were associated with VAP. In summary, the present study demonstrates that tracheotomy is independently associated with decreased risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia."

This new technique consists of inserting a tracheostomy tube by the use of a J guide wire inserted through a cannula into the tracheal lumen. Tapered dilators follow the guide wire and dilate the opening in the tracheal walls. A tracheostomy tube snugly fitted over a dilator is then passed into the trachea between the cricoid cartilage and the first tracheal ring. This procedure avoids the immediate and postoperative complications of \"standard\" tracheostomy. An experience of 134 tracheostomies of various types culminated in the development of the percutaneous technique. To date 26 such operations on 24 patients have been done with no significant complications due to the operation. The percutaneous technique should reduce the severity and incidence of intraoperative complications. Late complications, which have been no problem to date, are being evaluated with longer follow-up and with a greater patient population."

        "abstract": "Percutaneous dilational tracheostomy (PDT), according to Ciaglia's technique described in 1985, has become the most popular technique for percutaneous tracheostomy and is demonstrably as safe as surgical tracheostomy. In 1999, an extensively modified technique of PDT was introduced, the Ciaglia Blue Rhino (CBR; Cook Critical Care, Bloomington, IL), that consists of one-step dilation by means of a curved dilator with hydrophilic coating. To compare CBR with the basic technique of PDT, we performed a prospective, randomized trial in 50 critically ill adults. Twenty-five of these patients had PDT, and 25 had CBR. Average operating times were &lt;3 min for CBR (range: 50-360 s) and &lt;7 min for PDT (range: 4-20 min; P&lt;0.0001). Tracheostomy was successfully completed in all patients. When CBR was performed, 11 minor, nonlife-threatening complications were noted: nine fractures of tracheal cartilage and two short periods of intraoperative oxygen desaturation. During PDT, seven complications occurred, of which three were potentially life-threatening: two injuries to the posterior tracheal wall, one pneumothorax, two tracheal cartilage fractures (P&lt; 0.05 vs CBR), one case of bleeding, and one short episode of intraoperative oxygen desaturation. Regardless of whether PDT or CBR was performed, oxygenation was not significantly affected, and there was no infection of the tracheostoma. Based on our data, we conclude that new CBR is more practicable than PDT. No life-threatening complications occurred during CBR."

        "abstract": "A rapid method of definitive low tracheostomy utilizing an original instrument kit and percutaneous approach is described. Through a horizontal, shallow (1.5-cm) skin incision in the neck, a 12-ga needle is introduced into the tracheal lumen. A flexible metal guidewire is gently introduced through the needle, which is then removed. A specially designed percutaneous tracheostomy tool slides over the guidewire into the trachea; by squeezing its handles, the intercartilaginous space is enlarged, securing the placement of a cuffed tracheal cannula. After extensive and successful investigation in both cadaver and animal trials, the procedure was carried out in 80 patients who had a variety of underlying diseases, without serious complications. Of these 80 patients, 33 required airway control after neurosurgical interventions or after severe head trauma, 23 had percutaneous tracheostomy performed before radical excision for head and neck cancer, and the remaining 24 suffered from severe cardiorespiratory problems. Twenty-nine procedures were performed in the operating theater, and 51 procedures were carried out at the patient's bedside in the ICU, ED, or in the ward. There was no infection at the stoma site, and late healing was remarkable. It should be strongly emphasized that in the majority of our patients the procedure was carried out safely at the bedside. This resolved the logistic problem of moving very sick ICU patients (who are sometimes on high PEEP levels) to the OR. Although our experience is totally restricted to elective situations, we do postulate that it could be as effective in a variety of urgent situations."

In 41 patients, PDT was performed \"blind.\" In 35 patients it was executed with simultaneous bronchoscopic monitoring. The type and rate of complications of the two techniques were compared. Comparing the groups with and without bronchoscopy, the perioperative complication rate was equivalent (7% vs 6%); however, more severe complications occurred in the group without bronchoscopy (one death due to tension pneumothorax, two cases of perforating the rear tracheal wall) than in the group with bronchoscopy (two cases of intratracheal hemorrhage). PDT is a suitable bedside method for ICU patients undergoing long-term ventilation. Simultaneous endoscopy minimizes the severity of complications."

One hundred patients were randomized using a single-blinded envelope method to receive progressive or forceps percutaneous tracheostomy performed at the bedside. Operative time, the occurrence of hypoxaemia or hypercapnia and complications were recorded. The progressive technique took longer than the forceps technique (median 7 (range 2-26) vs. 4 (1-16) minutes, P = 0.0005). Hypercapnia occurred in both groups but was more marked with the progressive technique (56 (16) vs. 49 (13) mmHg, P = 0.0082). Minor complications (minor bleeding, transient hypoxaemia, damage to posterior tracheal wall without emphysema) were also more frequent with the progressive technique (31 vs. 9 complications, P &lt; 0.0001). Six major complications occurred with the progressive technique, none with the forceps technique (P = 0.0085): tension pneumothorax, posterior tracheal wall injury with subcutaneous emphysema, loss of airway with hypoxaemia, loss of stoma with impossible re-catheterization, and two conversions to another technique. In conclusion, progressive dilational tracheostomy took longer, caused more hypercapnia and more minor and major difficulties than forceps dilational tracheostomy."

The early use of tracheostomy as a method of primary airway management has been proposed as a means to decrease pulmonary morbidity and to shorten the number of ventilator, intensive care unit, and hospital days. We set out to (1) determine whether hypercarbia occurs during tracheostomy of the critically ill patient and (2) determine the extent to which the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in arterial blood (PaCO2) rises during percutaneous endoscopic, percutaneous Doppler, and standard surgical tracheostomy."

Insertion of the bronchoscope, along with the intraluminal dilators of the PET set, into the airway potentially leads to hypoventilation and hypercarbia during the procedure. Using continuous in-line arterial blood gas monitoring, we documented profound hypercarbia in two patients undergoing PET in the surgical ICU. In a third patient, the rise in PaCO2 was accompanied by a marked rise in intracranial pressure (ICP), and a corresponding fall in cerebral perfusion pressure. While transient hypercarbia seems well tolerated by most patients, this phenomenon and its effect on cerebral blood flow should be strongly considered before performing PET on the critically ill patient with evidence of elevated ICP."

        "abstract": "The flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope is used increasingly often as a multipurpose instrument in critical care medicine. In poor risk patients who need continuous mechanical ventilation, rigid open tube bronchoscopy is a problem. With the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope, however, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures can be carried out without interruption of ongoing mechanical ventilation. This procedure offers the possibility of bronchoscopy with reduced risk in debilitated patients. However, in these critically ill patients, the cardiopulmonary system is functioning at the borderline of its ability. Therefore, even the small changes in ventilation pattern caused by flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FFB) may in some cases cause dangerous cardiopulmonary distress. For example, changes of intrabronchial pressure, tidal volume, PaO2, PaCO2 and cardiac output may be caused by the procedure. Further, it is of great importance to restrict suction through the instrument to short periods to avoid dangerous alterations in the ventilation perfusion relationship. Since serious complications may occur, it is mandatory that the bronchoscopist be aware of the potential pathophysiologic effects of FFB during mechanical ventilation of critically ill patients."

        "abstract": "Percutaneous tracheostomy is increasingly being used for patients needing prolonged ventilatory support. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of widespread application of endoscopic guided percutaneous tracheostomy. Sixty-one consecutive ICU patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation underwent bedside endoscopic guided percutaneous tracheostomy. Using a modified Ciaglia technique, a #6-10 tracheostomy tube was introduced between the second and third tracheal rings. Bronchoscopic transillumination facilitated identification of the appropriate tracheostomy site, and verified satisfactory placement of dilators and tracheostomy tube. There was one procedure-related death due to arrhythmia. Procedure-related complications included (n = 7): bleeding (controlled with local pressure), two infections, two cuff tears, and two obstructions of the tracheal tube. The tracheostomy was eventually removed in 13 patients. Bronchoscopic evaluation of three patients at 4 months post-tracheostomy removal was normal and there has been no clinical evidence suggestive of tracheal stenosis in the remaining ten extubated patients. There was a 50% reduction in cost when compared to operative tracheostomy. Percutaneous tracheostomy is a simple, safe, cost-effective bedside procedure for critically ill ventilator-dependent patients. Endoscopic guidance appears to increase the safety of this procedure and may prevent complications of pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema, and paratracheal false passage previously reported with blinded percutaneous methods."

        "abstract": "Tracheostomy is a common surgical procedure performed in long-term ventilated patients in intensive care. Since the role of percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) on Intensive Care Unit (ICU) has become steadily more important in the last few years, a prospective study was started to evaluate the economic efficiency and to show the minimization of the complication rate of this procedure. In 72 patients we performed PDT as a bedside procedure. Initially the thyroid gland and the subcutaneous vessels were studied by ultrasound in every patient. The puncture of the trachea, the dilatational procedure and the insertion of the tracheal cannula were executed under bronchoscopic monitoring. Finally, a bronchoscopic control view followed via the new cannula to detect intratracheal complications. Mechanical ventilation was maintained during the procedure and controlled by continuous pulse oximetry. According to prior ultrasound findings the place to puncture the trachea was changed in 24% of the patients, in one case tracheostomy was performed as an open conventional procedure. The following complications could be observed: one case involving perforation of a cartilaginous ring, one case with venous bleeding of a small subcutaneous vein and two cases with punctures of the bronchoscope. There were no cases of miscannulation, penetration of the posterior tracheal wall or major bleeding requiring intervention or conversion. The followup study revealed that there was no sign of further complications in any patient. In addition, cost analysis demonstrated that there was a significant economical advantage of PDT in comparison with open standard tracheostomy. Standardized ultrasonographically and bronchoscopically controlled PDT turns out to be a safe, simple and cost effective bedside procedure on ICU. Because of ultrasound examination performed before the procedure, and bronchoscopic surveillance during the procedure, safety of this procedure can be enhanced, thus minimizing the rate of complications."

We retrospectively reviewed our intensive care practice using a guidewire dilatating forceps percutaneous tracheostomy technique with an endotracheal tube, as compared with the Classic Laryngeal Mask Airway (LMA) for these procedures. From 1998 to 2004, 274 patients underwent a tracheostomy procedure. Two-hundred-fifty-four (92.7%) of these patients underwent a guidewire dilatating forceps tracheostomy and 20 (7.3%) underwent a surgical tracheostomy. In the guidewire dilatating forceps group, 188 (74%) were performed by endoscopy via LMA-guided bronchoscopy, and 66 (26%) were performed through an endotracheal tube. Endoscopic views obtained via the LMA were subjectively better than those obtained with the endotracheal tube. Acute complications were significantly more frequent when using an endotracheal tube as compared with the LMA (6 of 66 versus 4 of 188; P = 0.022 Fisher's exact test, odds ratio = 4.6). There was a significant difference in terms of acute (10 of 254 versus 6 of 20; P &lt; 0.001, odds ratio = 10.5) and chronic (0 of 254 versus 4 of 20; P &lt; 0.001) complications between the 2 groups. There were no ventilatory complications or reports of gastric aspiration. The LMA provides a safe and effective alternative to an endotracheal tube for airway management during guidewire dilatating forceps tracheostomies in selected patients."

While there are numerous publications in the literature, there remains confusion due to the large variety of techniques and instruments with which it has been performed and the wide disparity in clinical outcome. This study evaluates the international literature on over 1,500 cases, classifies the techniques that have been used, analyzes the safety of each method, and reports a prospective outcome and cost analysis of 130 cases undergoing what we determined to be the safest method. We found that PT performed with the correct instruments and technique under bronchoscopic surveillance has a lower incidence of complications than open tracheostomy (OT). Cost estimation demonstrated that PT may be significantly more expensive than bedside OT. While we recommend PT as a relatively safe and expedient method of tracheostomy for selected intubated patients in an intensive care unit, it does not offer an advantage for patients who must be taken to the operating room, and should not deprive house officers of necessary experience in OT in this setting."

Patients with traumatic facial injuries, severe odontogenic infections, and head and neck malignancies are often recipients of tracheostomies. As such, the oral and maxillofacial surgeon who frequently treats such patients should be well-trained in tracheostomy placement. For decades, the standard technique for tracheostomy was the open surgical technique. However, during the past 20 years, the use of percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy has increased. The purpose of the present report is to review the percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy technique, describe the use of intensive care units as proxies for the operating room, and review the available evidence comparing percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy to open tracheostomy."

        "abstract": "Percutaneous tracheostomy with single-step dilation technique using Griggs' guidewire dilating forceps (GWDF) is a well-recognized procedure. Recently, Ciaglia has introduced a one-step dilation technique using a curved, gradually tapered dilator, the Ciaglia Blue Rhino (CBR). In a prospective, randomized study, we performed percutaneous tracheostomy in 60 consecutive patients, using either the CBR or the GWDF technique. Postoperatively, all patients had bronchoscopy by a blinded consultant, and stoma characteristics and injuries to the trachea were studied. Mean tracheostomy time (skin incision to insertion of tracheostomy tube) in the two procedures (CBR 7.5 min versus GWDF 6.5 min) was not different (P &gt; 0.05). The GWDF technique was associated with under-dilation and over-dilation of the tracheal stoma, each in almost one-third of patients. In the CBR group, the procedure was associated with a significant increase in peak airway pressure (P &lt; 0.05) in all patients. There were nine cases of tracheal cartilage rupture, three cases of longitudinal tracheal abrasion, and one pneumothorax. Three patients had tracheal in-drawing at the scar site with huskiness of voice at 8 wk after decannulation; however, none had any breathing difficulty. We conclude that the techniques are equally effective in the formation of percutaneous tracheostomy. However, tracheal stoma over-dilation with GWDF and increase in peak airway pressure and rupture of tracheal rings with CBR remain major concerns."

        "abstract": "Tracheostomy is considered the airway management of choice for patients who require prolonged mechanical ventilation. The development of percutaneous techniques offers many advantages including the ability to perform the procedure in the intensive care unit. The aim of this study was to compare the controlled rotating dilation method (PercuTwist) and the Griggs' forceps dilational tracheostomy. Patients over 18 years of age undergoing tracheostomy in the intensive care unit were included in the study. They were divided in two random samples--either PercuTwist or forceps dilational tracheostomy. Data collected prospectively included demographic characteristics, procedure duration, blood gas analysis, intracranial pressure, arterial blood pressure and heart rate before and after the procedure. Any complications during or after the procedure due to the tracheostomy were also recorded. Contrary to the main hypothesis, PercuTwist technique took significantly longer to perform than forceps dilational tracheostomy technique (five minutes [2 to 25] vs three minutes [1 to 17][P=0.006]). A significant increase in P(a)CO2 and decrease in arterial pH were observed in both groups between the pre-tracheostomy and post-tracheostomy blood gas analysis. Haemodynamic tolerance was good. Our results show that intracranial pressure is affected by the procedure whatever the technique used. However we did not observe a decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure. The incidence of complications was 23% (20/87). These complications were minor in 18/20 and were not significantly different between the two groups. In conclusion, we consider that the PercuTwist technique is safe despite the longer duration of the procedure. Nevertheless the forceps dilational technique remains our routine procedure."

        "abstract": "Tracheostomy continues to be a standard procedure for the management of long-term ventilator-dependent patients. Traditionally the procedure has been performed by surgeons in the operating theater using an open technique. This routine practice has recently been challenged by the introduction of bedside percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT), which has been reported to be a cost-effective alternative. The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the safety, procedure time, cost, and utilization of percutaneous and surgical tracheostomies at a university hospital. A retrospective medical chart review was performed on all ventilator-dependent intensive care unit patients at the University of Virginia Medical Center undergoing tracheostomy during a 23-month period beginning December 26, 1996. Of the 213 patients identified for review, 74 and 139 patients received percutaneous and surgical tracheostomies, respectively. Of 74 percutaneous tracheostomies, 73 reviewed were performed by general surgeons, pulmonary physicians, or anesthesiologists in the intensive care unit; all open tracheostomies were performed by surgeons in the operating room, and one percutaneous procedure was performed in the operating room. Perioperative complications occurred in five of 74 patients (6.76%) during PDT; of these, three patients (4.1%) experienced major complications requiring emergent operative exploration of the neck. Three patients (2.2%) experienced perioperative complications during surgical tracheostomy. The mean procedure time was significantly shorter for the percutaneous procedure. Average charges per patient in an uncomplicated case including professional fees, inventory, bronchoscopy (if performed), and operating room charges were $1753.01 and $2604.00 for percutaneous and standard tracheostomies, respectively. These charges do not include the charges associated with surgical intervention after PDT complications. In contrast to previously published reports showing complications clustered during a physician's first 30 percutaneous cases, our study demonstrated no relationship between complication occurrence and physician experience. That is, no learning curve associated with performing PDT was evident. In addition there was no association seen between physician specialty and complication rate. PDT in the intensive care unit costs less than surgical tracheostomy performed in the operating room and can be performed in less time. Several other studies have recommended that bronchoscopy during PDT provides additional safety; however, in our series all three major complications took place during bronchoscopy-assisted percutaneous procedures. Our series suggests that PDT carries an appreciable risk of major complications. Careful patient selection and additional experience with the procedure may decrease complication rates to an acceptable level."

The overall complication rate was 43.8% (n = 32) in the obese group compared to 18.2% (n = 73) in the control group (p &lt; 0.001). Seven (9.6%) obese patients suffered life-threatening complications compared to three non-obese patients (0.7%, p &lt; 0.001). Obese patients had a 2.7-fold increased risk for peri-operative complications, and a 4.9-fold increased risk for serious complications. The data suggest that percutaneous tracheostomy in obese patients is associated with a considerably increased risk for peri-operative complications, especially for serious adverse events."

        "abstract": "A total of 18 patients with acute lung injury (ALI) were sequentially ventilated with two different modes of mechanical ventilation, each applied for a period of 24 h: (1) volume-controlled inverse ratio ventilation (VC-IRV), (2) airway pressure release ventilation (APRV). The individual sequence of both ventilatory modes was randomized. Ventilatory minute volume was adjusted for a PaCO2 of 35 to 45 mm Hg at the beginning of the study during the first ventilatory mode and then kept constant within preset limits. Hemodynamic variables were stable and similar during the 24-h periods of VC-IRV and APRV as well. Despite the lower sedation and spontaneous breathing during APRV, oxygen uptake was similar during both ventilatory modes. During the 24-h period of VC-IRV there was no relevant change of either airway pressures, alveolo-arterial O2 tension difference (AaDO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FIO2) or venous admixture. In contrast, peak airway pressures (Pawmax) during APRV were significantly lower (about 30%; p &lt; 0.01), and decreased further within 24 h (p &lt; 0.05). During APRV AaDO2/FIO2 and venous admixture improved significantly with time after more than 8 h (AaDO2/FIO2: 487 versus 414 mm Hg; p &lt; 0.01; venous admixture: 20.6 versus 13.9%; p &lt; 0.01; medians of onset versus end). The improvement was significantly different between both ventilatory modes (p &lt; 0.01). We conclude that this indicates a progressive alveolar recruitment over time during ventilation with APRV.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Low-dose heparin treatment did not significantly increase the risk of chronic bleeding."

In the early publications, most authors considered adverse conditions such as short or fat neck or obesity as relative contraindications, whereas cervical injury and emergency were regarded as absolute contraindications. More recently, several reports demonstrated the safety and feasibility of PCT in patients with some of the above contraindications. We, like many others, gradually reduced the contraindications and expanded the indications for PCT. In this paper, we report our early experience with emergency PCT in trauma patients."

However, primary tracheostomy is a relatively complex procedure and places not inconsiderable stress on the patient. In a prospective study in our hospital over a period of 22 months, we were able to avoid primary tracheostomy in 11 patients with very difficult airways. All 11 patients were managed with prophylactically inserted transtracheal catheters and jet ventilation of the lungs. This ensured an adequate oxygen supply during tracheal intubation, and made overall patient management much easier. This method has established itself as a standard procedure in our hospital."

As patient safety and outcomes-based measures of clinical practice and procedures are in the forefront, the need for standardization in procedural training in high-volume centers of excellence beyond pulmonary and critical care fellowships must be considered. Other procedure-based specialties have developed such training programs, with structured curricula to enhance patient safety and outcomes, develop validated metrics for competency assessment of trainees, improve trainee education, and further advance the field by fostering research."

Training in such new minimal access techniques can be a significant risk factor in patient outcome. Surgical simulation provides training which minimizes this risk. We present a method of training in percutaneous endoscopic tracheostomy using a simulation model based on animal tissue. Our experience with this model is reported."

When the cannula protrudes from the soft tissue of the neck, the external tip is cut off and attached to the mechanical ventilator while the tracheal portion of the cannula is directed toward the carina by an obturator. One potential benefit of the translaryngeal tracheostomy method is that it avoids anterior compression of the trachea, which may be useful in younger patients with highly elastic tracheas. 14 A single-step screw-like dilator (PercuTwist; Ru ¨ sch, Kernen, Germany) has also been developed that uses rotation to advance the dilator to avoid complications associated with direct compression of the trachea ( Fig. 4 ). 15 Additional methods include use of a specialized speculum-like tracheostome, 16 a cutting bougie device, 17 and Rapitrac tracheostome (SurgiTech Medical, Sydney, Australia). 18",

Use of bronchoscopy with PDT has been associated with transient hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis 24-26 ; this may lead to an elevation in intracranial pressure and decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure. 27 These findings are not surprising because transient increases in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and partial pressure of carbon dioxide are known to occur during flexible bronchoscopy on mechanically ventilated patients because of partial occlusion of the ETT by the bronchoscope. 28 Nevertheless, complications resulting from these physiologic changes are rare and bronchoscopy remains a routinely performed procedure in the ICU. Bronchoscopy also uses additional equipment and personnel resources, affects procedural costs, and may result in procedure-related damage to the bronchoscope. Nevertheless, given the benefits of endoscopic visual guidance compared with its low risk, multiple authors have recommended its use to improve procedural safety. 13,21,29-32 Care should be taken to monitor and adjust mechanical ventilator settings to account for the partial obstruction of the ETT by the flexible bronchoscope and the resulting physiologic and ventilatory effects.",

Several trials comparing PDT with bronchoscopic guidance through an LMA versus ETT have been performed with varying results. Dosemeci and colleagues 38 demonstrated a greater incidence of hypercarbia along with higher associated rise in partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO 2) with ETT (56.7% of patients; 6.8 /C6 3.5 mm Hg) compared with LMA (38.5% of patients; 4.5 /C6 2.4 mm Hg).

          "). Before the procedure, the distal tip of the ETT is repositioned within the subglottic space proximal to the intended tracheostomy dilation site. A midline incision is made over the anterior trachea and the pretracheal soft tissue is bluntly dissected with mosquito clamps. The underlying trachea is then identified using a needle and introducer sheath. Flexible bronchoscopic visualization is commonly used to provide endoscopic guidance from within the trachea ( Fig. 2 ). Removal of the needle allows an introduction of a J-shaped guidewire through the introducer sheath into the trachea and directed caudally into the distal airways. The introducer sheath is then removed and dilation of the trachea and soft tissue is performed initially with a short dilator followed by a curved, conical dilator. Special precautions must be taken to ensure proper midline puncture of the anterior trachea wall and introduction of the guidewire and subsequent dilation through the anterior wall while avoiding puncture of the posterior membranous portion of the trachea. A trachestomy tube is loaded onto an introducer dilator and inserted into the trachea over the guidewire through the dilated stoma and secured in place. The use of the single dilator method is theorized to decrease the risk of injury to the posterior tracheal wall and prevent the risk of oxygen desaturation or"

When the cannula protrudes from the soft tissue of the neck, the external tip is cut off and attached to the mechanical ventilator while the tracheal portion of the cannula is directed toward the carina by an obturator. One potential benefit of the translaryngeal tracheostomy method is that it avoids anterior compression of the trachea, which may be useful in younger patients with highly elastic tracheas. 14 A single-step screw-like dilator (PercuTwist; Ru ¨ sch, Kernen, Germany) has also been developed that uses rotation to advance the dilator to avoid complications associated with direct compression of the trachea ( Fig. 4 ). 15 Additional methods include use of a specialized speculum-like tracheostome, 16 a cutting bougie device, 17 and Rapitrac tracheostome (SurgiTech Medical, Sydney, Australia). 18",

Use of bronchoscopy with PDT has been associated with transient hypercarbia and respiratory acidosis 24-26 ; this may lead to an elevation in intracranial pressure and decrease in cerebral perfusion pressure. 27 These findings are not surprising because transient increases in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and partial pressure of carbon dioxide are known to occur during flexible bronchoscopy on mechanically ventilated patients because of partial occlusion of the ETT by the bronchoscope. 28 Nevertheless, complications resulting from these physiologic changes are rare and bronchoscopy remains a routinely performed procedure in the ICU. Bronchoscopy also uses additional equipment and personnel resources, affects procedural costs, and may result in procedure-related damage to the bronchoscope. Nevertheless, given the benefits of endoscopic visual guidance compared with its low risk, multiple authors have recommended its use to improve procedural safety. 13,21,29-32 Care should be taken to monitor and adjust mechanical ventilator settings to account for the partial obstruction of the ETT by the flexible bronchoscope and the resulting physiologic and ventilatory effects.",

Several trials comparing PDT with bronchoscopic guidance through an LMA versus ETT have been performed with varying results. Dosemeci and colleagues 38 demonstrated a greater incidence of hypercarbia along with higher associated rise in partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO 2) with ETT (56.7% of patients; 6.8 /C6 3.5 mm Hg) compared with LMA (38.5% of patients; 4.5 /C6 2.4 mm Hg). Visualization of tracheal structures during PDT has also been found to be improved with the use of an LMA. 39,40 However, in a randomized comparison of 60 patients undergoing PDT, 6.6% of patients using ETT had cuff puncture and 3.3% had accidental extubation; in comparison, 33% performed with LMA had potentially catastrophic airwayrelated complications, including loss of the airway, significant hypoxia, and aspiration of gastric contents. 41 Therefore, although the use of an LMA with PDT has been shown to be feasible, its safety has not been convincingly demonstrated.",

Meta-analysis of 15 randomized, controlled trials involving 973 patients has demonstrated several important clinical outcome differences between PDT and surgical tracheostomy. 52 Most PDTs included in this analysis were performed using the multiple dilator method placed in the ICU setting. PDT was associated with a significant decrease in unfavorable scarring (odds ratio [Odds ratio (OR)], 0.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.23-0.83) and wound infections (Odds ratio (OR), 0.31; 95% CI, 0.22-0.62).
