Furthermore, technologies such as ultrathin-bronchoscopes, radialprobe endobronchial ultrasound (RP-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)), virtual navigation, and more recently robotic bronchoscopy, have so far failed to deliver a consistently higher diagnostic yield. Multiple explanations have been postulated for this phenomenon: inadequacy of sampling tools, CT-body divergence misleading navigational bronchoscopy, and the lack of an accurate real-time confirmatory technique.

CBCT provides an intra-procedural three-dimensional (3D) image dataset and can potentially impact all phases of diagnostic bronchoscopy: navigation, confirmation and tissue acquisition (12).

More recently, CBCT has emerged as an important imaging tool for bronchoscopists, primarily used during transbronchial biopsy of peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLS). For this application CBCT has proved useful in navigating devices to a target lesion, in confirming device tool-in-lesion, as well as during tissue acquisition. In addition, CBCT is poised to play an important role in trials evaluating bronchoscopic ablation by helping to determine the location of the ablative probe relative to the target lesion. Before adopting this technology, it is key for bronchoscopists to learn some basic concepts that will allow them to have a safer and more successful experience with CBCT. Hence, in the current manuscript, we will focus on both technical and practical aspects of CBCT imaging, ranging from systems considerations, image quality, radiation dose and dose-reduction strategies, procedure room set-up, and best practices for CBCT image acquisition."

Acquisition times range from 3-20 seconds and include up to 600 projection images, depending on the system type and imaging protocol, e.g., a 3-8 second acquisition duration is typical for body and cardiac applications. Projection images are then reconstructed, often on a separate workstation, using standard Feldkamp-based reconstruction algorithms, resulting in a 3D stack of axial images, analogous to conventional multi-slice CT (MSCT) ( Figure 1 ) (14). With current detectors of 30 cm × 40 cm, CBCT acquisition covers a volume of 24×24×18.5 cm 3 resulting in an isotropic volumetric dataset of 0.5 mm voxels in a 512×512 matrix.

However, floor and biplane systems seem less desirable because the system base is attached to the floor at the head end of the patient table, where the bronchoscope operator stands. Furthermore, floor and biplane systems perform CBCT only as a propeller acquisition, with the point of rotation directly above the patient's head. Thus, depending on the C-arm depth, this could limit the system's reach and PPLS near the base of the lung might be unreachable during CBCT, especially in taller patients. In contrast, ceiling and robotic systems adapt more easily to standard bronchoscopy workflows, with better patient access and less need of equipment rearrangement when transitioning between fluoroscopy and CBCT. These systems are also more easily moved away from both the operator and patient's chest if desired, e.g., during electromagnetic navigation (EMN) navigation, when presence of the X-ray detector can disrupt the electromagnetic field used for navigation. Robotic systems have an advantage in this regard, as they can be moved away from the patient completely without disturbing either the operator or surrounding equipment. Lastly, ceiling and robotic systems are more commonly found in Interventional Radiology and hybrid operating room settings compared to floor or biplane systems.",

Current reconstruction algorithms primarily rely on imaging the area of interest in all projection images and triangulating the corresponding 2D pixels from each projection to create a 3D voxel. Any kind of motion will result in inaccurate mapping of these 2D pixels, resulting in blurred 3D image.

However, many previous studies have reported estimates of effective dose (E) for CBCT, using a range of generalized conversion factors from 0.16 to 0.45 to create their estimates, which makes dose comparisons among studies difficult. The true conversion factor is system-specific and varies with anatomic location but can be measured using a calibrated phantom representative of patient population (19). The effective dose associated with CBCT has been measured using phantoms in several studies, with values of  0.98  mSv, 1.33 mSv and 3.32 mSv per acquisition, using 3 system types (20-22). These effective dose values correspond to acquisitions with 248, 312 and 419 projection images, respectively. These values are similar to those of a low-dose CT of the chest as performed during the National Lung Screening Trial (23)."

T o date, few studies have reported systematic use of collimation as a dose savings measure during CBCT-guided bronchoscopic procedures (25,26). However, in some cases it may be challenging to ensure the lesion is within the reduced field-of-view due to device-related deformation or atelectasis; thus, collimation might be most suitable for repeat CBCTs acquired after repositioning of devices."

It is of critical importance to maintain adequate paralysis to prevent any diaphragmatic motion/breathing effort during apneic breath hold.

In particular, raising the arms during CBCT can be helpful when trying to image lesions in the posterior/ dependent aspect of the lung. However, only one study to date has reported this approach during CBCT-guided bronchoscopy (6). Apart from image quality concerns, raising the arms can help ensure freedom of movement of C-arm in larger patients. However, raising and lowering the arms during the procedure could affect the accuracy of any fluoroscopic overlay being utilized. If this approach is to be utilized, both arms can be brought up above the head with a 90-degree flexion at the elbows and securely fastened with a strap. To minimize the time in this position and potential musculoskeletal injuries, this can performed after bronchoscopic navigation or deployment of biopsy tool, and just before the CBCT scan. If the initial scan shows unsuccessful navigation or biopsy tool positioning and further scanning is expected, the arms can be kept in this position for a few minutes. Nevertheless, the bronchoscopist should be conscious of this and expedite bronchoscopic maneuver as much as possible. If unable, arms should be brought down and re-positioned again just before the next CBCT scan."

Hohenforst-Schmidt and coworkers were the first group to report the use of airways segmentation overlaid on fluoroscopy images during CBCT-guided bronchoscopy in a prospective feasibility study. A larger but retrospective study by Pritchett at al . reported on the use of CBCT and fluoroscopic overlay during navigation with EMN with a diagnostic yield of 84% (11)."

For tool-in-lesion confirmation, CBCT is performed after the bronchoscopic biopsy tool is thought to have reached the target lesion, immediately prior to biopsy. The bronchoscope is secured and CBCT is performed; the resulting images are reviewed as MPRs or thick MIPs in multiple planes to determine the location of the tool relative to the lesion. In some clinical scenarios, reviewing the volume rendered images can be useful as well. Park et al. (10) found that tool-in-lesion confirmation by CBCT prior to biopsy was the only factor associated with increased diagnostic yield using a multivariate analysis in a single arm study of patients who underwent CBCTguided transbronchial lung biopsy. A small prospective study conducted by Casal et al. reported a 25% increase in navigational success and a 20% increase in diagnostic yield attributed to the tool-in-lesion confirmation CBCT (6). In addition, an interesting finding of their study was the detection of atelectasis in CBCT that was not visible on fluoroscopy alone, which were producing false-positive RPEBUS images and sometimes were completely obscuring the targets. These additional data further supported the utility of intra-procedural CBCT to accurately confirm tool-in-lesion during bronchoscopy for PPLS."

            "text": "With regards to limitations or disadvantages of using CBCT as an aid in diagnostic bronchoscopy, in addition to the radiation exposure described above, the lack of availability in most bronchoscopy rooms and the added time to procedures are worth mentioning. With the advent of mobile CBCT units with similar footprints as standard 2D c-arms, availability may not be an issue in the near future (34). Bronchoscopy time is indeed prolonged, and the number of scans and need for preparation (i.e., arms up) will determine by how much. Having said so, patients are typically under general anesthesia and an extra few minutes is unlikely to result in any harm."

This has the potential of avoiding non-diagnostic samples, reducing total number of samples needed for diagnosis, and reducing thus complications."

Percutaneous radiofrequency and microwave ablation, in particular, have been shown to be provide adequate local control (35). Nevertheless, percutaneous ablation inevitably violates the visceral pleura and pneumothorax is a very common complication. With a more favorable safety profile and the ability to provide also diagnosis and nodal staging in one setting, bronchoscopic ablation is hence emerging as a potential future therapeutic alternative for these patients (13). Several bronchoscopic ablation modalities are currently under development, with ongoing clinical trials, and CBCT promises to play a prominent role in this growing field. CBCT can detect in real-time the position of the ablating tools with respect to the target, provide a view of nearby anatomic structures (potentially preventing complications), and it could be utilized to assess for treatment changes and to detect complications in real-time (13,36)."

            "text": "CBCT is a relatively newer modality for endobronchial interventions that consists of a compact system mounted on a moving C-arm, thereby allowing the patient to remain stationary during the 3D imaging. In a single orbit around the patient, a complete volumetric dataset covering a large anatomic region of interest is acquired, and from this, a stack of images with submillimeter, isotropic resolution is generated. Given the need to enhance diagnostic yield of peripheral bronchoscopy and the growing interest in bronchoscopic ablation, CBCT has emerged as desirable technology to guide bronchoscopists when they venture into the lung parenchyma. Multiple studies are underway to investigate whether this technology will truly impact the current outcomes of peripheral bronchoscopy."

Navigational error of the system and movement of the biopsy tool during its deployment adversely affect biopsy success. Furthermore, conventional methods to confirm navigational success such as fluoroscopy and radial endobronchial ultrasound become less useful for the biopsy of small lesions. A hybrid operating theatre can provide unparalleled real-time imaging through DynaCT scan to guide and confirm successful navigation and biopsy of difficult-to-reach or small lesions. We describe our technique for DynaCT image-guided electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopic biopsy of a small pulmonary nodule in the hybrid operating theatre. The advantages, disadvantages and special considerations in adopting this approach are discussed."

        "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide and lobectomy remains the standard of care for patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The combination of an aging population and the implementation of low-dose CT for lung cancer screening is leading to an increase in diagnosis of early stage NSCLC in medically \"inoperable\" patients. The recommended treatment for this latter group of patients is stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). However, many patients cannot undergo SBRT because they have received prior radiation or because the tumor is located next to vital structures. Percutaneous ablative therapies have become an alternative to SBRT but, unfortunately, they all violate the pleura and are associated with high rate of pneumothorax. With a more favorable safety profile and the ability to provide also diagnosis and nodal staging, bronchoscopic ablation is hence emerging as a potential future therapeutic alternative for these patients. Herein we review the current state of the art including animal and human data that exists thus far. We also discuss technical and research challenges as well as future directions that this exciting new technology may take."

In the awake state no patient had clear signs of atelectasis on the CT scan. Lung ventilation and perfusion were well matched in most of the patients. Three patients had shunts corresponding to 2-5% of cardiac output, and in one patient there was low perfusion of poorly ventilated regions. CT scans after 15 min of halothane anesthesia and mechanical ventilation showed densities in dependent lung regions in 11 patients. A shunt was present in all patients, ranging from 1% in two patients (unchanged from the awake state) to 17%. Ventilation of poorly perfused regions was noted in nine patients, ranging from 1-19% of total ventilation. The magnitude of the shunt significantly correlated to the size of dependent densities (r = 0.84, P less than 0.001). Five patients studied during spontaneous breathing under anesthesia displayed both densities in dependent regions and a shunt, although of fairly small magnitude (1.8% and 3.7%, respectively). Both the density area and the shunt increased after muscle paralysis. PEEP reduced the density area in all patients but did not consistently alter the shunt. It is concluded that the development of atelectasis in dependent lung regions is a major cause of gas exchange impairment during halothane anesthesia, during both spontaneous breathing and mechanical ventilation, and that PEEP diminishes the atelectasis, but not necessarily the shunt."

Induction of anaesthesia in the supine position reduced the cross-sectional area for both lungs and caused atelectasis formation in dependent lung regions in 4/5 patients. Conventional ventilation with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) increased thoracic dimensions and reduced, but did not eliminate, the atelectatic areas. The vertical diameters of both lungs were smaller in the lateral position as compared to the supine position (16.7 vs 10.4 cm in the left lung and 17.3 vs 12.8 cm in the right lung). The lateral positioning also caused a large reduction of the atelectatic area in the non-dependent lung. Differential ventilation with selective PEEP to the dependent lung eliminated (3/8 patients) or reduced (5/8 patients) dependent lung atelectasis. It can be concluded that lung geometry is altered in the lateral position: the shape of the lung makes the vertical diameter of each lung less in the lateral position, compared to the supine position. The atelectatic areas are mainly located in the dependent lung in the lateral position, and these atelectatic areas could be further reduced by selective PEEP to this lung."

We studied the effects of gas composition on the formation of atelectasis and on gas exchange during the induction of general anaesthesia. In 12 adult patients, the lungs were ventilated with 30% oxygen in nitrogen during anaesthesia induction, and in another 12, a conventional technique was used (100% oxygen during induction and 40% oxygen in nitrogen thereafter). Extent of atelectasis was estimated by computed tomography and the ventilation-perfusion relation (VA/Q) by the multiple inert gas elimination technique. After anaesthesia induction, there was little atelectasis in the 30% oxygen group (mean 0.2 [SD 0.4] cm2) and a significantly greater amount (4.2 [5-6] cm2; p &lt; 0.001) in the 100% oxygen group. Patients in the 30% oxygen group were observed for another 40 min. 6 continued to receive 30% oxygen (subgroup A) and 6 were ventilated with 100% oxygen (subgroup B). During this time, the amount of atelectasis increased to 1.6 (1.6) cm2 in subgroup A and to 4.7 (4.5) cm2 in subgroup B (p = 0.047 for difference between groups). In subgroup A, the shunt (VA/Q &lt; 0.005) increased from 1.6 (2.0)% of cardiac output to 3.2 (2.7)%, but the arterial oxygen tension did not change. In subgroup B, the shunt increased from 2.6 (5.2)% to 9.8 (5.7)% of cardiac output. These results suggest that the composition of inspired gas is important in atelectasis formation during general anaesthesia. Use of a lower oxygen concentration than is now standard practice might prevent the early formation of atelectasis."

Recently, air embolisms after VATS marker pricking have been reported to be serious problems. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of intraoperative cone beam CT images on VATS to avoid preoperative VATS marker pricking. The CT number of the both GGO and nodule indicate the range from -200 to -800 HU in general. We evaluated the detection ability of the lesion in seven elements and the simulated lungs. The result indicated that there was a linear equation of \"y=1.0599&#xd7;-2.1492\" and the degree of correlation was \"R<sup>2</sup>=0.9826\" for the relationship between CT number and W number [voxel number in cone beam computed tomography (CBCT)]. Evaluation of low contrast resolution has been performed. The contrast noise ratios were 2.86 on CBCT and 1.50 on multi detector-row computed tomography (MDCT), while the relative contrast ratios were same both on CBCT and MDCT (0.19) as the lowest CT number (-700 HU). In clinical situation, four types of pulmonary lesions (pure GGO, mixed GGO, solid nodule, and cyst) were detected on MDCT, and intraoperative CBCT could identify all lesions as same configuration as on MDCT. The contrast noise ratio (CNR) and relative contrast ratio (RCR) could not admit the significant difference. In conclusion, the intraoperative CBCT can be used as a non-invasive image navigator for VATS, and the preoperative CT-guided VATS marker pricking can be avoided."

For these procedures, a thin-slice chest CT scan is performed prior to bronchoscopy at full inspiration and is used to create virtual airway reconstructions that are used as a map during bronchoscopy. Movement of the lung occurs with respiratory variation during bronchoscopy, and the location of pulmonary nodules during procedures may differ significantly from their location on the initial planning full-inspiratory chest CT scan. This study was performed to quantify pulmonary nodule movement from full inspiration to end-exhalation during tidal volume breathing in patients undergoing electromagnetic navigation procedures."

        "abstract": "The incidence of lung cancers in 2012 is estimated to reach 226,160 new cases, with only a third of patients suitable surgical candidates. Tumor ablation has emerged as an important and efficacious treatment option for nonsurgical lung cancer patients. This localized minimally invasive therapy is best suited for small oligonodular lesions or favorably located metastatic tumors. Radiofrequency ablation has been in use for over a decade, and newer modalities including microwave ablation, cryoablation, and irreversible electroporation have emerged as additional treatment options for patients. Ablation therapies can offer patients and clinicians a repeatable and effective therapy for palliation and, in some cases, cure of thoracic malignancies. This article discusses the available technologies and techniques available for tumor ablation of thoracic malignancies including patient selection, basic aspects of procedure technique, imaging follow-up, treatment outcomes, and comparisons between various therapies."

In general, the angular spacing between projection images, and the total number of images acquired, largely determines both the radiation dose and the degree of soft tissue contrast in reconstructed images. Both image quality and dose increase as the angular spacing between images is decreased.",

Although this is standard equipment for fixed CBCT systems, mobile c-arm users must ensure they have access to a carbon fiber table for all X-ray imaging. If a radio-opaque, metallic patient table is used during CBCT, a significant portion of the X-ray photons will be absorbed as the C-arm moves around the patient, resulting in significant artifacts in the reconstructed 3D images. Although this is an additional requirement imposed by the CBCT, these tables are motorized and can be operated in a manner equivalent to existing surgical tables in interventional pulmonology suites.",

In  addition,  image  intensity  with  CBCT is  non-calibrated gray scale values, as opposed to the calibrated Hounsfield Units (HU) used in MSCT. Thus, a standardized lung window, as is used with MSCT, is not possible with CBCT. Despite these differences in image",

In general, acquisitions with a  greater  number of projection images provide more data for reconstruction, which results in images with improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and better soft tissue differentiation (18). However, with any increase in projection images there is a concomitant increase in radiation dose, and potentially a longer scan duration, which can lead to worsened motion artifacts.",
          "ecent studies of CBCT-guided bronchoscopy have reported from 1 to 3 CBCT acquisitions per patient (6,11). Similar to image quality, the radiation dose for a single CBCT is  directly  related to the number of projection images acquired as well as the dose per projection image. Thus, it is important to consider these factors when comparing dose values among studies.",

T o this end, the patient should be positioned on the table so the target PPL is as close as possible to the center of the table. Most commercial systems employ a 2-step process for setting up CBCT: first, the lesion is isocentered in frontal and lateral projections; and second, a test spin is performed (collision check), without radiation, to ensure the C-arm can perform a full rotation without hitting the patient or ancillary equipment. Once the lesion has been isocentered in frontal position, it is important to only move the table up/down for lateral isocentering; otherwise, the frontal plane positioning will need to be repeated.",

In the absence of data, the authors recommend an inspiratory breath-hold during CBCT image acquisition with a tidal volume of 8-10 mL/kg of ideal body weight and a positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) of at least 10 cm of H 2 O (27). It is of critical importance to maintain adequate paralysis to prevent any diaphragmatic motion/breathing effort during apneic breath hold. Other factors such as post-intubation recruitment maneuvers, use of high levels of PEEP , and avoiding hyperoxia, may play a role in reducing atelectasis (28-31).",

In another study, 23 of 24 PPLS identified on pre-procedural MSCT were also well visualized on intraprocedural CBCT; the lesion not visualized was found to have resolved on follow-up MSCT (16).
