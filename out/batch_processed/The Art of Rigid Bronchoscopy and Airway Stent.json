    "abstract": "Rigid bronchoscopy and stenting is an additional skillset that should be obtained outside normal respiratory training. This is particularly seen in the United States where it is a separate fellowship and requires an additional year of dedicated training. However,inEurope,thereissignificantheterogeneity between health care systems and this needs addressing. Guidelines for lung cancer management recognize the central role of these techniques for a subgroup of patients who present with central airway compromise and associated symptoms. However, these techniques performed by skilled operators in the correct setting can significantly reduce symptoms and improve a patient's quality of life.

With the emergence of interventional pulmonology (IP) as a specific subspecialty within respiratory medicine, there has been renaissance in its use and, for many interventional pulmonologists, it occupies a central position in the management of both malignant and benign complex airway disorders. Indeed, despite the development of new techniques, for both diagnostic and therapeutic applications, many physicians still use the rigid bronchoscope as a mainstay of the procedure."

Its use allows direct access to the airway in a controlled manner and facilitates several treatment modalities, not exclusively including stent placement, endobronchial laser therapy, cryotherapy, electrocautery, argon plasma coagulation, and photodynamic therapy. Despite the development of new technologies, rigid bronchoscopy remains an invaluable skill. However, adequate training and knowledge of the procedure is vital in safely addressing central airway disease complications. A full discussion on all aspects of IP is beyond the scope of"

Killian is credited with the invention of the rigid bronchoscope and with describing the potential therapeutic indications. The first reported procedure was the removal of a pork bone from the right main bronchus of a farmer using a rigid esophagoscope in 1876. He then went on to describe the successful removal of foreign bodies from the airways in 3 separate cases. 1,2 In the paper 'Direckte Endoskope der Luft-und Speisewege,' published in 1915, Bru ¨ nings and colleagues 3 reported a success rate for foreign body removal of 98.3%, with failure to extract the aspirated material in only 12 out of 701 cases. This was a significant advance in the management of a condition with a known 50% mortality before the rigid bronchoscopy era."

The term stent is credited to Charles Stent who developed the first custommade mold of teeth in the nineteenth century. However, he was not to know that his name would become synonymous with this cornerstone of modern day medicine. 5 Over the last 30 years, stents have evolved from experimental interventions to essential components in many fields of medicine and surgery, including cardiology, vascular medicine, urology, otolaryngology, and pulmonology. Literature case reports of stent deployment go back as far as 1915. However, it was not until the development of the Montgomery T-tube in the sixties 8 and, more importantly, the major breakthrough that occurred with Dumon's 9 development of a dedicated silicone stent for the trachea and bronchi in the mid-1980s, that stent use became standard. The first airway stent was placed in Marseille, France, in 1985. With these 2 developments, stenting became an integral part of the management of airway compromise caused by benign and malignant conditions."

The gold standard stent remains the Dumon stent (Tracheobronxane, Novatech, La Ciotat, France). These prostheses are the most widely used stents worldwide. They are made from silicone with studs on the external surface. These studs prevent migration and reduce mucosal ischemia by limiting contact with the airway wall. The stents are available in a wide range of sizes and diameters (up to 18 mm in external diameter and 60 mm in length). This ensures that the stent can be sized to the required length to encompass the stenosis and 0.5 cm of normal mucosa above and below the stenosis. This minimizes the length of the stent and assists clearance of secretions and patient tolerance. The rims of each stent are polished to reduce the risk of granuloma formation. In addition, recent advances include radiopaque studs. The Dumon Gold Studded Stent (Novatech, La Ciotat, France) improves radiographic visualization. The Dumon silicone stent is also available in a Y-design for disease at the level of the carina. Unlike the straight stent, the Y-stent is more difficult to place correctly and requires a significant amount of time to position across the carina using rigid grasping forceps. In addition, hourglass stents are available that are particularly suitable for benign stenosis. Another commercially available silicone stent is the Polyflex stent (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA). This stent is made from polyethylene threads built into the silicone. The stent may adapt better to an hourglass stenosis when compared with the Dumon silicone stent; however, it has a higher migration rate because it is more easily compressed than the Dumon stent. Other silicone stents, such as the Hood stent (Hood Laboratories, Pembroke, MA, USA) and the Noppen stent (MTW, Essen, Germany), are no longer commercially available.

It is preferable that these procedures are planned and that the patient is reviewed in clinic before undertaking the intervention.

As far as malignant obstruction is concerned, the Silicone Prosthesis in Obstructive lung Cancer (SPOC) trial has redefined the role of stenting. 67 This study concluded that a stent is only required as a palliative treatment when initial primary oncology treatments have proven insufficient. Historically, the management of a trachea-esophageal fistula was with double stenting (esophageal and tracheal or bronchial stents). This practice has also changed in recent years with a significant decrease in double stenting, which is reserved for cases of persisting aspiration or symptomatic secondary compression of the airway after esophageal stenting."

The authors think that good technique, including selection of stent size and type, can assist in reducing complications. In addition, poststent care is essential to prevent longer term complications, including the use of saline nebulization at various concentrations and mucolytics to reduce rate of mucoid impaction, halitosis, and stent infection. Finally, stents placed for benign indications or stents in situ for a long duration will require periodic replacement."

        "abstract": "The era of bronchoscopy began with Gustav Killian in 1876 when he removed a pork bone from a farmer's airway, using an esophagoscope. Prompted by this accomplishment, Chevalier Jackson, an American otolaryngologist, laid the platform for the modern-day rigid bronchoscope in the early twentieth century. In 1967 Shigeto Ikeda revolutionized the field of bronchoscopy by his innovation of the fiberoptic bronchoscope. Today, bronchoscopy and interventional pulmonology have become an integral part of pulmonary medicine and an established subspecialty. Numerous innovators have furthered the horizons of this technology. In the early 1980s Ko-Pen Wang introduced transbronchial needle aspiration to sample mediastinal lesions while Jean-Fran&#xe7;ois Dumon developed methods for laser photoresection and for placing stents thorough the bronchoscope. More recently, application of endobronchial ultrasound and electromagnetic navigation tools has further galvanized the role of bronchoscopy. The success of lung transplantation also belongs in part to flexible bronchoscopy. Today, researchers are looking into treating emphysema as well as asthma, using bronchoscopic techniques. We believe 2015 is a good time to look back on the history of bronchoscopy and to recognize its major milestones. This article attempts to connect the historical dots in this field of research, with the hope that our effort helps future generations improve the welfare of patients with lung ailments."

Its outside surface bears regularly located studs to prevent displacement. The first results are encouraging: 154 stunts have been placed in 86 patients. They were well tolerated and complications were rare. Migration occurred on 15 occasions; in 7 cases a poorly designed early prototype had been used. Obstruction was noted in 5 cases without major problems. Granulomas were found in 28 cases and were treated by endoscopic resection. At the time of writing, the mean follow-up period is 3 months and the longest is 22 months."

The \"open tube\" bronchoscope provides safe access to the lower airways and has proved to be compatible with newer, more sophisticated therapies as they have been introduced into the practice of bronchology. The twenty-first century surely will provide the bronchoscopist with exciting new diagnostic and therapeutic tools for the management of lung diseases, and it is likely that the rigid bronchoscope will continue to play an important role in delivering these tools to the airways. Pulmonologists need to appreciate the use of this classic instrument and prevent rigid bronchoscopy from becoming a forgotten art."

Minimally invasive endobronchial techniques have resulted in symptom control and long-term improvements. The rigid bronchoscope remains the method of choice for the treatment of both benign and malignant central airway obstruction. However, it has limited use if lesions are located in the upper lobes or lung periphery, but significant technological advances allow for effective treatments using the flexible bronchoscope. Rigid and flexible bronchoscopes should be seen as complementary procedures and most cases require the use of both modalities."

        "abstract": "Diagnostic indications for flexible bronchoscopy in the initial investigation of children with suspected foreign-body (FB) aspiration have not been evaluated prospectively. We prospectively collected history, clinical, and radiologic findings at prebronchoscopic examination of all children referred for suspected FB aspiration between February 1993 and September 1995. Children with asphyxiating FB aspiration, requiring immediate rigid bronchoscopy, were excluded. If there was clear evidence of FB aspiration from the physical and radiographic findings, rigid bronchoscopy was directly performed. If the evidence was not convincing, children underwent diagnostic flexible bronchoscopy under local anesthesia. If an FB was found, rigid bronchoscopy was always performed for extraction. Eighty-three consecutive children (median age: 24 mo) were included. Among 28 who underwent rigid bronchoscopy first, 23 had an FB. Among the 55 children who underwent flexible bronchoscopy first, 17 had an FB. Predictive signs of a bronchial FB were a radiopaque FB, and associated unilaterally decreased breath sounds and obstructive emphysema (positive predictive value = 0.94). We propose the following management algorithm: Rigid bronchoscopy is performed first in case of asphyxia, a radiopaque FB, or association of unilaterally decreased breath sounds and obstructive emphysema. In any other case, flexible bronchoscopy is performed first for diagnostic purposes. If applied retrospectively to the 83 children in our study, this algorithm would have decreased the negative first rigid bronchoscopy rate to 4%. Flexible bronchoscopy is a safe and cost-saving diagnostic procedure in children with suspected FB aspiration."

        "abstract": "We report our 13-year experience with endoscopic treatment of malignant obstructions of the airway by Nd:YAG laser, stents, and intraluminal brachytherapy in 2,008 patients. We performed 2,610 laser resections in 1,838 patients, 66 high dose rate brachytherapies, and we placed 393 tracheobronchial silicone stents in 306 patients. We used the rigid bronchoscope in 96% of the laser procedures and in all cases requiring stent placement; general anesthesia was given to 90% of these patients. Endobronchial radiotherapy was performed under local, anesthesia. In 93% of patients undergoing laser resection, we obtained an immediate patency of the airway with consequent improvement of quality of life. The median time between the first and second laser treatment was 102 days, being longer in the case of stent placement (when required) or in association with brachytherapy. Even if endoscopic treatment should be considered only for palliation, laser vaporization could be curative in case of in situ carcinoma. Since 1983, we have treated 23 such lesions in 17 patients and up to now, none has recurred. Finally, endoscopic resection may allow a better assessment of the true extent of the tumor, shifting to surgery patients originally considered to have inoperable disease or allowing lung-sparing operations (21 and 18 patients of our series, respectively). The total mortality rate was 0.4% (12 patients over 2,798 treatments; 2,710 Nd:YAG laser + 151 stents without laser + 37 brachytherapies without laser) in the first week after the procedures, and was mainly related to cardiovascular problems and respiratory failure. In conclusion, endoscopic resection of lung malignancies is rapid, effective, repeatable, and complementary to other treatments; although it should be considered only palliative, laser resection could be curative in patients with in situ carcinomas and early cancers. Laser, stents, and endoluminal brachytherapy should be available in all centers with major experience; a well-trained team is mandatory to plan the most appropriate treatment and manage any possible complication."

The rigid bronchoscope was used in 1,280 (92 percent) of the treatments, with patients almost always under general anesthesia; 116 (8 percent) treatments were performed with the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope alone, with the use of local anesthesia. In almost all cases of benign tumors and in many carcinoid tumors, the treatment was curative. In genuine nonmalignant tracheal stenoses, laser therapy was curative in 34 out of 81 cases. In malignant tumors, the laser improved airway gauge 92 percent of the time. Cumulative survival was 50 percent (+/- 3 percent) at six months and 26 percent (+/- 3 percent) at one year. Following palliative laser therapy, eight patients with bronchogenic carcinoma appearing to be inoperable did have surgery and ten underwent less extensive surgery than expected. Results confirm the usefulness and safety of this relatively new method in the treatment of obstructive lesions of the tracheobronchial tree."

        "abstract": "Argon plasma coagulation (APC) is a thermal coagulation technique that uses ionized argon to transmit high-frequency electrical current, contact free, to tissue. APC has been used in surgery for more than 20 years, particularly for the hemostasis of superficial bleeding. Although APC has become well established in gastrointestinal endoscopy since its introduction in 1991, very few reports of its use in bronchoscopy exist to date. From June 1994 to June 1998, 364 patients (80 women, 284 men), 88% with a confirmed malignant tumor, were treated prospectively in a total of 482 sessions. The single most common indication was recanalization of malignant airway stenoses (186 patients). The defined therapy objective was achieved with good results in 67% of patients. More than 90% of interventions were performed with rigid bronchoscopy. Despite less penetration compared with Nd:YAG laser, extensive bronchial tumors were treatable, in which coagulated tumor fractions were removed either with forceps or bronchoscope tip. The second indication was bleeding in the central airways (119 patients). Acute hemostasis was achieved in 118 patients, 20% in whom the flexible technique under local anesthesia was used. In 34 patients, APC was successfully used to recanalize occluded stents. Rare indications included benign endobronchial tumor, fistula conditioning before fibrin adhesion, and the treatment of scar tissue stenosis. Summarizing all complications, a rate of 3.7% \"per treatment\" was recorded. Two patients died within 24 hours; their deaths were not directly related to APC. APC is an effective and safe technique for the treatment of bronchologic tumor ablation and hemostasis and can be used with local anaesthetic with flexible bronchoscopy or rigid bronchoscopy with general anesthesia. Compared with Nd:YAG laser, APC is an economic alternative technique offering more effective hemostasis. Furthermore, APC is of particular value as a compliment to well-known techniques, increasing the options in interventional bronchoscopy."

        "abstract": "Lung cancer is the commonest cause of cancer death, with a very poor survival rate. By the time of diagnosis, most cases are at an advanced stage and about 30% present with symptoms caused by central endobronchial obstruction. Endobronchial cryosurgery is an effective technique, which can be used to relieve tracheobronchial obstruction caused by lung cancer. This report describes the technique, using a nitrous oxide cooled cryoprobe, inserted through a bronchoscope, to remove the obstruction and reopen the airway. In this study, 476 consecutive patients (mean age 68.3 years, M:F ratio 1.9:1) with obstructive tracheobronchial tumours underwent a mean of 2.4 cryosurgical treatments. Their TNM staging was, stage II 6.7%, IIIa 21.0%, IIIb 23.9%, IV 48.4%. Improvement in symptom quantification was found with 76.4, 69.0, 59.2, and 42.6% of symptomatic patients for haemoptysis, cough, dyspnoea, and chest pain, respectively. Mean values for respiratory function improved from 1.38 to 1.41 litres for FEV1 and 1.91 to 2.04 litres for FVC (p &lt;/= 0.0001). Mean performance status improved from 59.6 to 75.2 for Karnofsky scale and 3.04 to 2.20 for the WHO scale and the complication rate was 3.5% of treatments. The Kaplan-Meier median survival was 8.2 months and 1- and 2-year survival 38.4 and 15.9%, respectively. Survival analysis suggested a possible survival advantage over alternative palliative techniques. Endobronchial cryosurgery provides a safe and effective method for the palliation of otherwise inoperable lung cancer. It has advantages over other methods in terms of safety, cost, and a low complication rate. Cryosurgery can be repeated as often as required."

        "abstract": "Twenty patients with inoperable carcinoma in the trachea or a main bronchus were investigated before and one and 10 days after treatment with a carbon dioxide laser. Patients were assessed by spirometry, maximum flow-volume loops, and a visual analogue score of breathlessness on a scale from 0 (not at all breathless) to 100 (very breathless). At day 10 mean FEV1 had improved from 51.9% to 62.6% of predicted (p less than 0.02) and mean peak expiratory flow (PEF) from 45.3% to 53.1% of the predicted value (p less than 0.05). Improvements in maximum inspiratory and expiratory flows at 50% vital capacity were not significant but the breathlessness score decreased from a mean of 49.1 to 35.3 (p less than 0.01). Improvements in breathlessness were significantly correlated with increases in FEV1 and PEF. Thirteen of the 20 patients had unilateral tumours with partial or complete occlusion of the main bronchus; in these perfusion and ventilation were assessed by radioisotope scans before and 10 days after treatment. Seven of the 13 patients showed an increase in perfusion of the affected lung after treatment but the improvement was small, with a mean increase in unilateral perfusion in the 13 patients of 2.4% of the total counts. Four patients with no perfusion of the affected side showed no significant improvement after laser treatment. Changes in ventilation scans were similar to those in perfusion. It is concluded that laser treatment improves airway function and dyspnoea in malignant narrowing of central airways and that in unilateral obstruction such treatment results, at best, in a small increase in the contribution of the affected lung to perfusion."

Patients with malignant CAO scheduled for Nd&#x2009;:&#x2009;YAG laser resection were prospectively recruited in the trial. All patients were given European Organization for Research and Treatment, Quality of Life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-30 v.3) before the procedure and approximately 2 weeks after the treatment. There were 37 male and 10 female patients, average age 54&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;10 years. Most common tumour type was adenocarcinoma diagnosed in 51% of patients. Majority of patients were diagnosed in stage IIIB (53.2%) and stage IV (25.5%). Most common Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was 1 (72.3%). Nd&#x2009;:&#x2009;YAG laser resection significantly improved (P&lt;0.0001) QoL and overall health according to EORTC QLQ-30. However, in some of the questions dealing with nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, family life, social activities and financial situation, we did not observe statistically significant improvement.

        "abstract": "We performed YAG laser photoresection in 11 patients with tracheal or mainstem bronchial obstruction due to malignant or benign disorders. We used maximal inspiratory-expiratory flow-volume loops and expiratory volume-time plots to assess air flow limitation. Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), peak expiratory flow (PEF) and iso-volume maximal flows at 50 percent of forced inspiratory and expiratory volume were calculated. Spirograms and flow-volume loops were repeated within 12 to 72 hours of laser resection. All patients had flattened expiratory limbs on their flow-volume loops. All spirometric parameters increased significantly following laser photoresection. In particular, peak flow improved in all patients, and FEV1 improved in nine of 11 patients, even though four patients had moderate to severe obstructive ventilatory defects which persisted after resection and were probably due to longstanding chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We conclude that flow-volume loops and spirometry are helpful in assessing the site and nature of malignant large airway obstructive processes and, moreover, provide reliable information for evaluating the efficacy of laser photoresection. Serial physiologic studies indicate changes in the caliber of the upper airways and can be used as a simple means of following these patients."

To assess the functional benefit of prosthesis insertion in these indications, we compared functional respiratory values before, immediately after (48 h), and at sometime after (mean, 10.1 months) operation in 24 patients presenting with a bronchial lesion (B group, n = 5) or a lesion of the intrathoracic part (ITT group, n = 9) or of the extrathoracic part of the trachea (ETT group, n = 10). Before treatment, airflow was severely impaired in most patients without significant differences among the groups. After prosthesis insertion, airflow parameters increased [change in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (delta FEV1 = 440 mL; delta peak expiratory flow (PEF) = 0.92 L.s-1; delta maximum expiratory flow 25/75 (delta MEF25/75) = 0.47 L.s-1; and delta forced inspiratory volume in 1 s (delta FIV1 = 310 mL)] and airway resistances (Raws) decreased (delta Raw = -0.43 kPa.s-1.s-1) without any significant variation in either forced vital capacity (FVC) or total lung capacity. Airflow improvement was more apparent in ITT and ETT groups than in the B group. Moreover, inspiratory flow increase and decrease of FEV1/PEF ratio were only observed in the ETT group. This airflow improvement was maintained for a long time after and was associated with a good clinical tolerance. This study supports the clinical and functional benefits of prosthesis placement both in benign and malignant airway compressions for palliative treatment."

The primary prognostic factors are the rate of bleeding and the underlying cardiopulmonary status of the patient. Bronchoscopy is central in management, but the goals differ, depending on circumstances. In stable patients who have minimal hemoptysis, bronchoscopy can diagnose the cause specifically and be used as the primary treatment modality. In the setting of massive or life-threatening bleeding, bronchoscopy primarily is performed to maintain ventilation and to direct endobronchial blockade. Although flexible bronchoscopy is an acceptable mode initially, there should be no delay in performing rigid bronchoscopy when it becomes apparent that bleeding is too vigorous to permit [figure: see text] successful airway exploration with the smaller flexible instrument. Once isolation of bleeding has been achieved, the choice must be made between embolization, surgical resection, or both of these procedures."

Massive hemoptysis can lead to asphyxiation and airway obstruction, shock, and exsanguination. Bronchoscopy plays an integral part in managing massive hemoptysis in diagnosis and treatment (Table 5). Specifically, bronchoscopy allows lateralization and more specific localization of bleeding that is critically important for effective management. Furthermore, acute control of bleeding can sometimes be achieved with instruments and catheters placed through the bronchoscope or by agents instilled into the airways through the bronchoscope."

These lesions with specific characteristics at various levels--such as cuff and stomal--present with the signs and symptoms of airway obstruction. They are best handled in an emergency with systematic dilation. Under certain circumstances surgical repair is best deferred using repetitive dilations or intubation through an appropriately located stoma. Preferred management is surgical resection with primary reconstruction. Special techniques are necessary in cases in which larynx is also involved. With diagnostic precision and meticulous surgical technique, good or satisfactory results were obtained in nearly 94% of 503 surgically treated patients. Best results are obtained at an initial corrective operation performed by an experienced operator."

        "abstract": "Tracheobronchial obstruction is a distressing cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with benign and malignant disease. Resection offers curative treatment for a few, but for the majority of patients who are too frail for surgery, and for those benign and malignant cases where the disease is too extensive for resection, there is a need for an effective method of palliation. We retrospectively reviewed the results of a 9-year experience in 86 patients with major airways obstruction (51 malignant and 35 benign) treated on one or more occasions using various endoscopic techniques. Nineteen patients presented as an emergency. Thirty-nine had received other forms of treatment beforehand including external radiotherapy and laser resection (Nd:YAG). Treatment undertaken in our institution was: diathermy resection (36 patients), gold grain implantation (16 patients), bougienage (9 patients), cryotherapy (2 patients), Montgomery T-tube and T-Y stent (28 patients) and varied endotracheal and endobronchial stents (40 patients). Twenty-two patients were treated with more than one modality at the first treatment session. Twenty-one patients required revision of their endobronchial stents or T-tubes because of displacement or partial occlusion by mucous accretions. There were no intraoperative deaths or complications and the average length of stay was 5 days (range: 2 to 14 days). Eighty-three patients reported immediate symptomatic relief. Objective improvement in lung function tests was demonstrated in patients whose condition was less acute and preoperative measurements could be made. In the diathermy resection group there was an average improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) of 53.1% and in the forced vital capacity (FVC) of 20.6%.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

In 8 patients with end-stage malignant tumours of the tracheobronchial tree, tumor compression of the major airways became apparent after Nd-YAG laser debulking. Dumon-type stents (Endoxane), were inserted under general anaesthesia. There were no complications during and after stent insertion. All stents were well tolerated, with significant symptomatic relief in all patients. This symptomatic relief was considered worthwhile, despite the limited duration of palliation and the pre-terminal stage of the patients. Tumour progression after stent insertion was usually beyond any treatment possibility, except additional laser coagulation. The median survival was 2 months and the longest palliation was 11 months."

Once an esophagotracheal fistula has developed, the overall condition of the patient declines rapidly. Aspiration pneumonia and severe coughing are common. The introduction of esophageal tubes does not always seal the fistula sufficiently and may compromise the airway causing stridor and dyspnea. In 30 patients (25 male, 5 female; age 23 to 74 years; mean, 56 years) with very large fistulas and airway problems, we inserted an airway stent (Dynamic) (n = 12) or an esophageal tube combined with a Dynamic airway stent (n = 18) with the aim of sealing the fistula and restoring patency of the airway and GI passage. The tracheobronchial Dynamic stent was chosen because its slightly concave, flexible posterior silicone membrane adapts ideally to the convex esophageal tube. The stents were well tolerated and significantly improved the quality of life. Of 30 patients, 16 could breathe and swallow unimpaired until shortly before their death. Moderate complaints persisted in five patients, dysphagia in eight patients, and dyspnea in one patient. Mean survival time in the double stent group was significantly greater (110 days) than in the airway stent-only group (24 days) or comparable groups in the literature treated with esophageal tubes only. We conclude that carefully selected patients can benefit from double stenting of esophagus and airways."

Of the 4,595 procedures, 1,146 were performed with a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope (Olympus BF-5B2 or BF-B2) under topical anesthesia with tetracaine and procaine, and 3,449 procedures were performed with a rigid bronchoscope under general intravenous anesthesia with hexobarbital (Evipan) using a modified Sanders' technique to ventilate the patients. Complications occurred in 235 procedures (5.1 percent). Major complications that threatened the patient's life and required intensive medical treatment, surgical intervention, or resuscitative measures occurred in 51 procedures (1.1 percent); deaths occurred after 6 procedures (0.1 percent). A comparison of the complications of rigid bronchoscopy and flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy revealed significantly higher rates of complications of fiberoptic bronchoscopy attributable to toxic effects of tetracaine and of complications of rigid bronchoscopy associated with insufficient general anesthesia. With rigid bronchoscopy, the number of major complications induced by diagnostic manipulations through the bronchoscope and the total number of major complications were significantly higher than with flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy."

Stents may be applied for maintaining airway patency after dilatation of postinflammatory and infectious strictures, for airway dehiscence after lung transplantation, and for the management of tracheobronchomalacia. Fistulas between trachea or bronchi and the esophagus and dehiscence of pneumonectomy stump can be protected with covered stents. Choice of stent depends on careful patient selection, characteristics of airway stenosis, physician's expertise, and availability of equipment. Placement of tube stents requires rigid bronchoscopy and dilatation of strictures beforehand, whereas metal stents can be applied using a flexible bronchoscope. Advantages and disadvantages of commonly used airway stents are discussed."

They are generally divided into two types: the silicone stents and the metallic stents. Unlike in malignancies, removability is a major objective of temporary stenting in benign conditions, which poses the challenge of a new rigid bronchoscopic procedure under general anesthesia and stent removal with all its attendant risks and costs. The concept of a biodegradable (BD) stent that could maintain the patency of an airway for a predetermined duration of time is very appealing. These BD stents would gradually degrade and eventually vanish from the airway once they are no longer needed. Such stents are currently an area of intense research. Another very promising concept of drug delivery with such stents is also a very exciting area of current research. The aim of this comprehensive review is to discuss all pertinent available literature on the use of BD materials in various clinical applications and to extensively review all animal and humans trials involving BD airway stents."

        "abstract": "Poor postoperative healing after sinus surgery is associated with high concentrations of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). The frontal recess is especially vulnerable to restenosis, and frontal sinus stents have been used to overcome this problem. However, the long-term success rate is still controversial and may be poor. In this perspective, we developed doxycycline (DC)-releasing stents, delivering the MMP-9 synthesis-suppressing agent locally to the frontal recess area. We evaluated postoperative MMP-9 levels, bacterial colonization, healing quality, and symptom scores in patients suffering from chronic rhinosinusitis with (CRSwNP) and without nasal polyposis (CRSsNP) (n=10) who underwent functional endoscopic sinus surgery during which the DC-releasing and placebo stents were placed. We found that MMP-9 concentrations were significantly lower at the side of the DC-releasing stent (3,414+/-582 ng/mL) compared with the contralateral placebo stent (9,172+/-2,564 ng/mL) (p&lt;0.05) at month 3 postsurgery. DC stents adequately suppressed bacterial growth compared with placebo stents. Furthermore, the visual analog scale (VAS) for the frontal region was significantly better (mean value 75.1 vs. 52.8, p&lt;0.001) compared with its placebo counterpart. We conclude that compared with placebo stents, DC-releasing stents significantly lowered MMP-9 concentrations and bacterial colonization locally, and improved postoperative healing quality after functional endoscopic sinus surgery, as demonstrated by visual analog scale and ostial closure."

        "abstract": "Recent advances in the three-dimensional (3D) printing industry have enabled clinicians to explore the use of 3D printing in preprocedural planning, biomedical tissue modeling, and direct implantable device manufacturing. Despite the increased adoption of rapid prototyping and additive manufacturing techniques in the health-care field, many physicians lack the technical skill set to use this exciting and useful technology. Additionally, the growth in the 3D printing sector brings an ever-increasing number of 3D printers and printable materials. Therefore, it is important for clinicians to keep abreast of this rapidly developing field in order to benefit. In this Ahead of the Curve, we review the history of 3D printing from its inception to the most recent biomedical applications. Additionally, we will address some of the major barriers to wider adoption of the technology in the medical field. Finally, we will provide an initial guide to 3D modeling and printing by demonstrating how to design a personalized airway prosthesis via 3D Slicer. We hope this information will reduce the barriers to use and increase clinician participation in the 3D printing health-care sector."

In the last 10 years, formal IP fellowships have increased substantially in number from five to now &gt; 30. The vast majority of IP fellowship trainees are selected through the National Resident Matching Program, and validated in-service and certification examinations for IP exist. Practice standards and training guidelines for IP fellowship programs have been published; however, considerable variability in the environment, curriculum, and experience offered by the various fellowship programs remains, and there is currently no formal accreditation process in place to standardize IP fellowship training. Recognizing the need for more uniform training across the various fellowship programs, a multisociety accreditation committee was formed with the intent to establish common accreditation standards for all IP fellowship programs in the United States. This article provides a summary of those standards and can serve as an accreditation template for training programs and their offices of graduate medical education as they move through the accreditation process."

A recent review of index computed tomography scans in patients presenting consecutively with a new diagnosis of lung cancer to a UK hospital found that endobronchial disease was reported in 29% (95% CI 24.4-33.5), with a total of 7.6% (95% CI 4.9-10.2) of patients having involvement of a central airway. 26 This differs considerably from the historical literature but still represents a significant burden of disease, which may go neglected in centers without access to interventional pulmonologists. Such patients are recognized as having a poor outcome, 27 whereas intervention can lead to improvements in performance status, quality of life, and physiologic measures. 28-30 Chhajed and colleagues 31 demonstrated no difference in survival between those with malignancy receiving chemotherapy but without central airway obstruction (median survival 8.4 months) compared with the subjects who underwent successful airway recanalization by means of laser (25%), stent (25%), or both (50%), followed by adjuvant chemotherapy (median survival 8.2 months P 5 .395).",

Extrinsic compression without intraluminal disease is readily treated with dilation followed by stenting. Mixed (intrinsic and extrinsic) obstruction is usually managed with both debulking and stent insertion. Usually, the benefits noted after successful bronchoscopic treatment of obstruction last for 2 to 3 months. 32 Benefit duration after stent placement is generally reported to be around 4 months before tumoral stent overgrowth, 33 but this duration can be increased with the use of effective oncologic treatments (ie, chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy).",

Fig. 4 is a typical diagrammatic representation of a rigid bronchoscope and its components. Multiple ports on the proximal end of the bronchoscope allows for the attachment of various ventilation devices and ancillary tools, such as suctioning tubes to aspirate blood, secretions, pus, and smoke, and easy introduction of ancillary instruments; for example, laser probes, cryoprobes, and rigid forceps. 14,55 In addition, the design of the rigid bronchoscope itself allows for rapid recanalization of obstructed airways using its distal bevel to core and debulk tumors, the so-called core-out or corkscrew technique.",

It is an important tool with easy maneuverability that allows exploration and clearing of peripheral airways, examination of more distal airways, and inspection of segments lateral to the central airways.

Once a decision is made to place a stent, the length of stenosis and required diameter needs to be measured. This can be performed with dedicated measuring forceps. The required stent size is estimated from the diameter of the rigid tube and the length can be measured using a flexible bronchoscope. The size of the stent should exceed the size of the stenosis by 1 cm, which allows 0.5 cm of clearance at the distal and proximal margin ( Fig. 10 ).

The size of the stent should exceed the size of the stenosis by 1 cm, which allows 0.5 cm of clearance at the distal and proximal margin ( Fig. 10 ). The stent should be larger than the stenosis so that there is adequate radial force to keep the prosthesis in position. Only experienced bronchoscopists who can respond and manage both the early and late complications of advanced airway disease should place stents.",

Finally, they set out guidelines for the minimum institutional volumes necessary for accreditation of an IP fellowship program. Ongoing standardization of practice within Europe and the United States will further cement the position of IP as a subspecialty in respiratory medicine.",
