    "abstract": "Flexible and rigid bronchoscopes are used in diagnosis, therapeutics, and palliation. While their use is widespread, effective, and generally safe; there are numerous potential complications that can occur. Mechanical complications of bronchoscopy are primarily related to airway manipulations or bleeding. Systemic complications arise from the procedure itself, medication administration (primarily sedation), or patient comorbidities. Attributable mortality rates remain low at < 0.1% for fiberoptic and rigid bronchoscopy. Here we review the complications (classified as mechanical or systemic) of both rigid and flexible bronchoscopy in hope of making practitioners who are operators of these tools, and those who consult others for interventions, aware of potential problems, and pitfalls in order to enhance patient safety and comfort. Key Words: Bronchoscopy, complications, endoscopy, intensive care",

Systemic  complications  arise  from  the procedure itself, medication administration (primarily sedation), or patient comorbidities. Attributable mortality rates remain low at < 0.1% for fiberoptic and rigid bronchoscopy. Here we review the complications (classified as mechanical or systemic) of both rigid and flexible bronchoscopy in hope of making practitioners who are operators of these tools, and those who consult others for interventions, aware of potential problems, and pitfalls in order to enhance patient safety and comfort."

[1,2] Bronchoscopy, both fiberoptic and rigid, encompasses a number of diagnostic and therapeutic techniques to visualize the luminal surface of the trachea and proximal airways. Flexible or fiberoptic bronchoscopy, allows for excellent visualization of the airway lumen and luminal surface including segmental and subsegmental bronchi with a relatively less traumatic instrument; rigid bronchoscopy enables more therapeutic options but is limited to the trachea and main bronchi unless combined with a fiberoptic bronchoscope. [1,2] Bronchoscopy has become an important tool not only for visualizing abnormalities, but also for biopsy/tissue sampling, removal of secretions, mucous plugs, clots, and foreign bodies. More recent advances include stent placement for relief of airway compression, laser applications (tumor resection), curtailing hemorrhage (using cryocoagulation/cryotherapy), assisting in the"

Other mechanical complications included four brushes breaking off in the bronchi, at least one of which required thoracotomy, and 52 episodes of life-threatening airway complications (most commonly bronchospasm). [8] Lindholm et al ., examined airway pressures of patients undergoing fiberoptic bronchoscopy and found that while spontaneously breathing patients had little change in airway pressures (average of - 5.2 cmH 2 O during inhalation and + 3.5 cmH 2 O during exhalation), intubated patients had a much wider range (as low as - 35 cmH 2 O during inhalation and higher than + 35 cmH 2 O during exhalation).

[11] The pattern of these pressure changes leads to a decrease in vital capacity (as tidal volume is restricted by high pressures and is lost via bronchoscopic suction), and a decrease in forced expiratory volume secondary to obstructed exhalation, which increases auto-positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and functional residual capacity (FRC). This increase in auto-PEEP and FRC may actually protect against hypoxemia, particularly if the patient is breathing 100% oxygen, although following removal of the bronchoscope the PEEP and FRC will decrease, at this point atelectasis, bronchospasm, and laryngospasm may all lead to post-procedural hypoxemia unless treated promptly. [12,13]  Prolonged suctioning during bronchoscopy can lead to further derecruitment and atelectasis, as well as worsening of post-procedural hypoxemia. [11,13]  Despite these physiologic derangements, mechanical rates of pulmonary complications remain low with rates of pneumothorax from 0.07 to 0.16%, and respiratory failure from 0.2 to 0.31% in more recent studies.

This was confirmed by Credle et al ., who reported only two instances of pneumonia in 24,521 procedures. [9]  Kovaleva et al ., demonstrated that Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most commonly transmitted organism by an improperly cleaned bronchoscope, most likely secondary to its ability to form biofilm in the bronchoscope channels. [15] Infection can also be introduced from the oro- or nasopharynx into the lower respiratory tract (as well as from an infected to a non-infected area of the lung). Pharyngeal microbes are most common in this scenario: Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Moraxella, Neisseria, and anaerobic bacteria. [15]  A prospective observational study of 13 hospitals confirmed a low reported rate of pneumonia as 0.6% (five of 908 procedures) in fiberoptic bronchoscopy.

[3] Rates of aspiration are inconsistently reported across all studies likely reflecting the difficulty in making the diagnosis unless frank aspiration is observed. This class of complication is also likely intimately tied to the type and amount of sedation received by the patient. A cross-sectional study by Simpson et al ., demonstrated wide variability in sedation practices at that time. [16]  As early as the 1970s, cases of death related to both sedation and local anesthetics were reported surrounding fiberoptic bronchoscopy. [8] Subsequently, no cases of sedation-related morbidity or local anesthetic toxicity were reported by Pue and Pacht in the 1995 study. [3] They attributed their lower rate of complications to close monitoring (including pulse oximetry) and immediate availability of resuscitation equipment. It may be that standardization of sedation practices and the use of supplemental oxygenation also played a role in the decrease in sedation and anesthesia-related morbidity and mortality. [16]"

[8] It has been reported that heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac output all increase during fiberoptic bronchoscopy, and that increases in myocardial oxygen demand may induce arrhythmias or ischemia in at-risk patients. [13,17] Indeed unspecified cardiac arrest accounted for much of the reported mortality in early studies. [6-8]  Rates of ST changes during fiberoptic bronchoscopy have been reported as high as 17% (for patients over age 50), [18] but severe arrhythmias are cited less than 0.1% of the time. [19] More difficult to quantify is the effect of bronchoscopy on patients with preexisting pulmonary disease (often the indication for the procedure).

Increased airway pressures may be transmitted to the thoracic space and therefore raise intracranial pressure (ICP) (raising both systolic blood pressure and impairing venous return). However, the data on high extrinsic PEEP does not reliably show an increase in ICP. [20]  A series of 26 fiberoptic bronchoscopies performed in patients with ICP monitors demonstrated an increase in ICP in 81% of cases, however the mean arterial pressure also increased leading to a normal cerebral perfusion pressure in all cases, and no cases had neurologic sequelae. [21]  It is therefore common practice not to withhold fiberoptic bronchoscopy in patients with elevated ICP when the procedure is indicated, but to use sedation and paralysis if necessary to attempt to mitigate the increase in ICP in unstable patients."

[28]  Though the invention of the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope by Ikeda in 1967 changed the field of bronchoscopy, the use of the rigid bronchoscope remains an important technique in the management of upper airway disease.

[30,31]  There has been an expanding interest in the management of central airway obstruction by pulmonologists and this has led to a renewed interest in rigid bronchoscopy. [32]  More than just treating cancer-related central airway obstruction mechanically, rigid bronchoscopy also makes possible a number of therapies such as laser/photoresection, endobronchial stents, balloon dilation, electrocautery, use of the argon beam, and cryotherapy. [1]  The wide channel of the rigid bronchoscope lends itself to easier removal of foreign bodies from the airway and debulking of masses, easier control of hemorrhage during therapeutic interventions in the trachea and mainstem bronchi, as well as easier dilation of proximal airways, and easier deployment of stents and other airway implantables, all while allowing for relative ease of ventilation.

One retrospective study reviewed 775 cases of rigid bronchoscopy in a university hospital between 1992 and 1999 and found that 86.7% of cases occurred without any of the above listed complications.

The skilled and mature operator has fewer complications than novices, nonetheless, it is very safe even in the hands of trainees. [38] However, the operator needs to be cognizant of methods to attenuate any bleeding complications. At the time of hemorrhage the nonbleeding lung must be protected. Whether the patient is intubated or not, the patient should be positioned with the bleeding lung in the decubitus, dependent position (if hemodynamics permit), and if necessary, a double lumen tube will have to be placed in the nonbleeding lung (this will require special skills). [41]  Other methods of bleeding control include the instillation of cooled saline into the bronchus and then clamping the bronchus with the fiberoptic scope tip. [42]  If this does not work then 5 mL of thrombin may be instilled (5,000 U dissolve in saline), [43] or, alternately, 2 mL of 1:1,000 epinephrine mixed with normal saline in a 1:10 mixture in order to produce vasoconstriction, thereby reducing bleeding (no more than three 2-mL aliquots are recommended). [41]  There has also been use of tranexamic acid with significant airway bleeding, [44,45] and even activated factor VII has been instilled into the lungs with successful resolution of bleeding (author TJP, case to be published). Sometimes there are large thrombi that can block the airways once the bleeding stops, and these may need to be removed with cryotherapy, which has been in use for over 30 years [Figure 5].

        "abstract": "Rigid bronchoscopy, a procedure more than 100 years old, now has been performed in three centuries. The \"open tube\" bronchoscope provides safe access to the lower airways and has proved to be compatible with newer, more sophisticated therapies as they have been introduced into the practice of bronchology. The twenty-first century surely will provide the bronchoscopist with exciting new diagnostic and therapeutic tools for the management of lung diseases, and it is likely that the rigid bronchoscope will continue to play an important role in delivering these tools to the airways. Pulmonologists need to appreciate the use of this classic instrument and prevent rigid bronchoscopy from becoming a forgotten art."

Over the past decade, advanced imaging techniques, such as autofluoresence bronchoscopy, electromagnetic navigation, narrow-band imaging, confocal fluorescence microendoscopy, and endobronchial ultrasound, have greatly expanded the diagnostic utility of bronchoscopy. This article reviews the technological advances in the field of diagnostic bronchoscopy."

Major complications (respiratory arrest, pneumonia, pneumothorax, and obstruction of airways) occurred in 1.7 per cent (15) of the procedures. There was one death, yielding a mortality of 0.1%. Minor complications, including vasovagal reactions, fever, cardiac arrhythmias, bleeding, obstruction of airways, nausea and vomiting, pneumothorax, psychotic reaction, and aphonia, occurred in 6.5% of the procedures. Pneumothorax occurred after 5% (four) of 85 transbronchial biopsies. Although serious complications occur more frequently than previously reported from retrospective studies, complications after fiberoptic bronchoscopic procedures are still quite infrequent. The relative risks and benefits must always be carefully weighed in patients being considered for a fiberoptic bronchoscopic procedure."

From approximately 48,000 procedures, ten deaths were reported and are described. Information about two additional deaths not obtained from data on the questionnaires is also included. All patients who died had either myocardial disease, severe chronic pulmonary disease, serious pneumonia, or cancer. Two deaths were associated with evidence on necropsy of fresh myocardial infarctions that had been unsuspected prior to the procedure. Two deaths occurred after administration of local anesthesia prior to bronchoscopic examination. Two were patients who previously had slowly hemorrhaging tumors that hemorrhaged massively following, respectively, forceps biopsy and saline lavage. Four brushes broke off in bronchi. Ten cardiac arrests and 41 life-threatening reactions to anesthesia also occurred."

        "abstract": "The flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope is used increasingly often as a multipurpose instrument in critical care medicine. In poor risk patients who need continuous mechanical ventilation, rigid open tube bronchoscopy is a problem. With the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope, however, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures can be carried out without interruption of ongoing mechanical ventilation. This procedure offers the possibility of bronchoscopy with reduced risk in debilitated patients. However, in these critically ill patients, the cardiopulmonary system is functioning at the borderline of its ability. Therefore, even the small changes in ventilation pattern caused by flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FFB) may in some cases cause dangerous cardiopulmonary distress. For example, changes of intrabronchial pressure, tidal volume, PaO2, PaCO2 and cardiac output may be caused by the procedure. Further, it is of great importance to restrict suction through the instrument to short periods to avoid dangerous alterations in the ventilation perfusion relationship. Since serious complications may occur, it is mandatory that the bronchoscopist be aware of the potential pathophysiologic effects of FFB during mechanical ventilation of critically ill patients."

In these patients with moderate airway obstruction, functional residual capacity (FRC) increased significantly after inserting the ETT, after placing the FFB in the airway through the ETT, and after inserting the flexible bronchoscope transnasally. The mean increase in FRC was 30 percent in the intubated group before FFB insertion and 17 percent in the transnasal group. Removal of the FFB and ETT caused FRC to return toward the control value. Insertion of the ETT-FFB combination or transnasal FFB did not change PaO2 substantially, although following the examination, PaO2 was decreased significantly in the transnasal group but not in the intubated group. The PaO2 decreased significantly in both groups following removal of the ETT and transnasal FFB. These results suggest that placement of an FFB or ETT-FFB combination in the airway in spontaneously breathing subjects elevates FRC."

        "abstract": "Fiberoptic bronchoscopy has become a commonplace procedure in ICUs. Despite the fact that one of the most common indications for bronchoscopy is the presence of retained secretions and atelectasis, there is little research dedicated to its safety and utility in this clinical situation. This article presents a case of an intubated trauma victim who had undergone numerous bronchoscopic procedures, with varying degrees of success, for retained secretions and atelectasis. This review then seeks to answer the following three main questions regarding bronchoscopy in critically ill patients: (1) Is bronchoscopy effective in resolving atelectasis? (2) Is bronchoscopy superior to other means of resolving atelectasis? (3) Is bronchoscopy safe in critically ill patients? The patient was a 28-year-old man with no significant medical history who presented to the emergency department after his car was hit by a dump truck. He was found to have multiple leg fractures and a splenic rupture, and he was taken to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy, splenectomy, and reduction of his fractures. He was then brought to the surgical ICU intubated, sedated, and receiving mechanical ventilation. Over the next 6 h, he developed progressive hypoxemia and diffuse, bilateral alveolar infiltrates on a chest radiograph (CXR). Four days postoperatively, a routine CXR revealed total atelectasis of his right upper lobe (RUL). Emergent bronchoscopy was performed, and a large mucus plug obscuring the RUL bronchus was removed. Follow-up CXR demonstrated resolution of the atelectasis. The next day, RUL atelectasis was again seen on his CXR. A repeat bronchoscopic examination and BAL failed to reveal any plug. A follow-up CXR showed continued atelectasis. Over the next week, the patient underwent daily bronchoscopy for atelectasis with variable degrees of improvement. Over the next 3 weeks, his pulmonary status improved until he was eventually extubated, and 1 month after hospital admission he was discharged to rehabilitation."

        "abstract": "Flexible endoscopy is a widely used diagnostic and therapeutic procedure. Contaminated endoscopes are the medical devices frequently associated with outbreaks of health care-associated infections. Accurate reprocessing of flexible endoscopes involves cleaning and high-level disinfection followed by rinsing and drying before storage. Most contemporary flexible endoscopes cannot be heat sterilized and are designed with multiple channels, which are difficult to clean and disinfect. The ability of bacteria to form biofilms on the inner channel surfaces can contribute to failure of the decontamination process. Implementation of microbiological surveillance of endoscope reprocessing is appropriate to detect early colonization and biofilm formation in the endoscope and to prevent contamination and infection in patients after endoscopic procedures. This review presents an overview of the infections and cross-contaminations related to flexible gastrointestinal endoscopy and bronchoscopy and illustrates the impact of biofilm on endoscope reprocessing and postendoscopic infection."

        "abstract": "In 1983 a postal survey of the bronchoscopic practice of chest physicians in the United Kingdom produced a 90% response rate. Two hundred and thirty one physicians were carrying out bronchoscopy; they had performed about 40 000 bronchoscopies in the preceding year, 87% of these being fibreoptic procedures with topical anaesthesia. The mortality rate of fibreoptic bronchoscopy was 0.04%, with a 0.12% incidence of major complications. Transbronchial biopsy carried both an appreciably higher mortality rate of 0.12% and a major complication rate of 2.7%. There is wide variation in the use and choice of sedative drugs for fibreoptic bronchoscopy. Many of the drug combinations could be criticised on pharmacological grounds. The mean dose of lignocaine was 342 mg, most operators exceeding the usual maximum recommended dose; but adverse reactions were rare. Routine supplemental oxygen was given by only 18% of bronchoscopists. Basic resuscitation equipment was often inadequate. Radiological screening was used for transbronchial lung biopsy by 53% of respondents and significantly reduced the incidence of pneumothorax from 2.9% to 1.8%. Both the number of bronchoscopies performed and the complication rate were higher than previous estimates. Bronchoscopists should re-examine their policy on drugs and safety precautions to minimise the risks of the procedure."

        "abstract": "One hundred seven acutely ill ventilated patients were prospectively studied to ascertain the severity and frequency of alterations in gas exchange and hemodynamic parameters during brief bronchoscopy. Sedation was performed using midazolam (0.1 mg/kg IV) without topical anesthesia. An average decline in PaO2 of 26 percent was observed at the end of the procedure, compared to the baseline value, and this was associated with a mild increase in PaCO2 in spite of the use of a special adapter. Alterations in mean systolic blood pressure appeared to be modest, consisting of a 10 percent decrease from the control level, related to sedation, and a 10 percent rise from baseline during the procedure, associated with a concomitant mild tachycardia. At that time, central hemodynamic measurements performed in a subset of 31 patients showed a significant increase in cardiac output associated with higher pulmonary wedge pressure. Fourteen patients developed hypoxemia of less than 60 mm Hg on FIO2 adjusted to 0.8. Of the ten risk factors univariately associated with hypoxemia, only the presence of ARDS (p less than 0.001) and \"fighting\" the ventilator during the procedure (p less than 0.05) remained significant after stepwise logistic regression. Attempts to prevent hypoxemia in critically ill patients should focus on inducing complete sedation, with careful attention to hemodynamic status, or providing maximal levels of oxygen to the ventilator (or both)."

It has been shown to be a safe procedure with only occasional complications. However, in patients with head injuries, FB can lead to intracranial hypertension. Sustained increases in intracranial pressure (ICP) leads to poor outcome in these patients. Because of this, a prospective study was done not only to assess the effect of FB on ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) in patients with brain injuries, but also to identify a regimen of sedation and anesthesia that could prevent significant increases in ICP during FB."

        "abstract": "The era of bronchoscopy began with Gustav Killian in 1876 when he removed a pork bone from a farmer's airway, using an esophagoscope. Prompted by this accomplishment, Chevalier Jackson, an American otolaryngologist, laid the platform for the modern-day rigid bronchoscope in the early twentieth century. In 1967 Shigeto Ikeda revolutionized the field of bronchoscopy by his innovation of the fiberoptic bronchoscope. Today, bronchoscopy and interventional pulmonology have become an integral part of pulmonary medicine and an established subspecialty. Numerous innovators have furthered the horizons of this technology. In the early 1980s Ko-Pen Wang introduced transbronchial needle aspiration to sample mediastinal lesions while Jean-Fran&#xe7;ois Dumon developed methods for laser photoresection and for placing stents thorough the bronchoscope. More recently, application of endobronchial ultrasound and electromagnetic navigation tools has further galvanized the role of bronchoscopy. The success of lung transplantation also belongs in part to flexible bronchoscopy. Today, researchers are looking into treating emphysema as well as asthma, using bronchoscopic techniques. We believe 2015 is a good time to look back on the history of bronchoscopy and to recognize its major milestones. This article attempts to connect the historical dots in this field of research, with the hope that our effort helps future generations improve the welfare of patients with lung ailments."

Rigid bronchoscopy has proved to be an excellent tool to provide airway access and control in this cohort of patients.

We routinely use negative pressure ventilation (NPV) under general anaesthesia to prevent intraoperative apnoea and respiratory acidosis. This procedure allows opioid sparing, a shorter recovery time and avoids manually assisted ventilation, thereby reducing the amount of oxygen needed, while maintaining optimal surgical conditions. The major indication for NPV rigid bronchoscopy at our institution has been airway obstruction by neoplastic tracheobronchial tissue, mainly treated by laser-assisted mechanical dissection. When strictly necessary, we use silicone stents for neoplastic or cicatricial strictures, reserving metal stents to cover tracheo-oesophageal fistulae. NPV rigid bronchoscopy is an excellent tool for the endoscopic treatment of locally advanced tumours of the lung, especially when patients have exhausted the conventional therapeutic resources. Laser-assisted mechanical resection and stent placement are the most effective procedures for preserving quality of life in patients with advanced stage cancer."

Minimally invasive endobronchial techniques have resulted in symptom control and long-term improvements. The rigid bronchoscope remains the method of choice for the treatment of both benign and malignant central airway obstruction. However, it has limited use if lesions are located in the upper lobes or lung periphery, but significant technological advances allow for effective treatments using the flexible bronchoscope. Rigid and flexible bronchoscopes should be seen as complementary procedures and most cases require the use of both modalities."

        "abstract": "Due to growing interest in management of central airway obstruction, rigid bronchoscopy is undergoing a resurgence in popularity among pulmonologists. Performing rigid bronchoscopy requires use of deep sedation or general anesthesia to achieve adequate patient comfort, whereas maintaining oxygenation and ventilation via an uncuffed and often open rigid bronchoscope requires use of ventilation strategies that may be unfamiliar to most pulmonologists. Available approaches include apneic oxygenation, spontaneous assisted ventilation, controlled ventilation, manual jet, and high-frequency jet ventilation. Anesthetic technique is partially dictated by the selected ventilation strategy but most often relies on a total intravenous anesthetic approach using ultra-short-acting sedatives and hypnotics for a rapid offset of action in this patient population with underlying respiratory compromise. Gas anesthetic may be used with the rigid bronchoscope, minimizing leaks with fenestrated caps placed over the ports, although persistent circuit leaks can make this approach challenging. Jet ventilation, the most commonly used ventilatory approach, may be delivered manually using a Sanders valve or via an automated ventilator at supraphysiologic respiratory rates, allowing for an open rigid bronchoscope to facilitate ease of moving tools in and out of the airway. Despite a patient population that often suffers from significant respiratory compromise, major complications with rigid bronchoscopy are uncommon and are similar among modern ventilation approaches. Choice of ventilation technique should be determined by local expertise and equipment availability. Appropriate patient selection and recognition of limitations associated with a given ventilation strategy are critical to avoid procedural-related complications."

Although many anesthesia providers have kept pace with the challenge, the practice is varied and frequently suboptimal. Shared airway during bronchoscopy poses unique challenges. The available reviews have tried to address this lacuna; however, these have frequently dealt with the technical aspects of bronchoscopy than anesthetic challenges. The present review provides evidence-based management insights into anesthesia for bronchoscopy-both flexible and rigid. A systematic approach toward pre-procedural evaluation and risk stratification is presented. The possible anatomical and physiological factors that can influence the outcomes are discussed. Pharmacological principles guiding sedation levels and appropriate selection of sedatives form the crux of safe anesthetic management. The newer and safer drugs that can have potential role in anesthesia for bronchoscopy in the near future are discussed. Ventilatory strategies during bronchoscopy for prevention of hypoxia and hypercarbia are emphasized."

This technique is characterized by specific technical problems, insofar as the anesthesiologist and the operators share the same space, namely the airway. Several potential complications (hemorrhage inside the airway, threat to ventilation ...) may arise. These challenges render the ability to use the variable available techniques essential, as well as knowledge of the complications they could entail, and the ability to rapidly solve them. General anesthesia is usually total intravenous anesthesia, using short acting agents. Ventilation can be spontaneous, but more often insured using high-frequency jet ventilation. The hospital infrastructure and staff must have the expertise to perform this particular procedure, in order to limit the complication rate."

Complications occurred in 235 procedures (5.1 percent). Major complications that threatened the patient's life and required intensive medical treatment, surgical intervention, or resuscitative measures occurred in 51 procedures (1.1 percent); deaths occurred after 6 procedures (0.1 percent). A comparison of the complications of rigid bronchoscopy and flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy revealed significantly higher rates of complications of fiberoptic bronchoscopy attributable to toxic effects of tetracaine and of complications of rigid bronchoscopy associated with insufficient general anesthesia. With rigid bronchoscopy, the number of major complications induced by diagnostic manipulations through the bronchoscope and the total number of major complications were significantly higher than with flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy."

Identifiable bleeding sites can be controlled locally by iced saline, vasopressors, laser, electrocautery and balloon tamponade. Bleeding from an unidentifiable source, on the other hand, is much more difficult to control as the bleeding site is not accessible by the bronchoscope. Tranexamic acid (TA), a synthetic anti-fibrinolytic agent, is approved for treatment or prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in hemophilia or following major operative procedures via intravenous or oral routes. Its efficacy in controlling bleeding from mucosal tissue led us to apply it to patients with pulmonary bleeding. Six patients with significant hemoptysis, two who bled during bronchoscopy biopsy and four with spontaneous bleeding (lung cancer, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, idiopathic pulmonary bleeding, metastatic thyroid carcinoma) were treated with TA. For the two who bled during bronchoscopy, we used a bolus of 500mg/5mL through the bronchoscope working channel, while the latter four received aerosolized TA 500mg/5ml 3-4 times a day. In all cases, the bleeding stopped with the first dose of TA, and the treatment was well tolerated without adverse events. While limited due to the small number of patients, these data show that TA administered either as a bolus through the bronchoscope or via inhalation seems to be effective in controlling severe hemoptysis from both identifiable and unidentifiable bleeding sites. Further clinical studies are needed to evaluate the use of the TA in this set-up."

In some cases, methods such as endobronchial instillation of iced saline lavage and epinephrine may fail to control bleeding. The present study evaluated the efficacy and safety of a new bronchoscopic technique using intratumoral injection of tranexamic acid (IIT) for control of bleeding during forceps biopsy in patients with endobronchial tumors with a high risk of bleeding."

Twenty-eight patients were treated on 60 occasions with a closed liquid nitrogen system and a long insulated probe that was specifically designed to be used through an open ventilating bronchoscope. The conditions of 15 patients (54%) was improved, as judged by local tumor control, decreased bleeding, or improved airway patency. Fatal complications that could be ascribed to cryotherapy occurred in 2 of the 60 treatments (3%). Two patients have experienced complete control of squamous cell cancers four years and five years nine months after cryotherapy."

[11] The pattern of these pressure changes leads to a decrease in vital capacity (as tidal volume is restricted by high pressures and is lost via bronchoscopic suction), and a decrease in forced expiratory volume secondary to obstructed exhalation, which increases auto-positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and functional residual capacity (FRC). This increase in auto-PEEP and FRC may actually protect against hypoxemia, particularly if the patient is breathing 100% oxygen, although following removal of the bronchoscope the PEEP and FRC will decrease, at this point atelectasis, bronchospasm, and laryngospasm may all lead to post-procedural hypoxemia unless treated promptly. [12,13]  Prolonged suctioning during bronchoscopy can lead to further derecruitment and atelectasis, as well as worsening of post-procedural hypoxemia. [11,13]  Despite these physiologic derangements, mechanical rates of pulmonary complications remain low with rates of pneumothorax from 0.07 to 0.16%, and respiratory failure from 0.2 to 0.31% in more recent studies. [3,14]  Rates of more minor pulmonary mechanical complications including bronchospasm and laryngospasm range from 0.26 to 2%. [3,6,14]",

[23]  It is a support adjunct to help guide the site of tracheal puncture entry of the tracheostomy, and to avoid damage to the posterior wall of the trachea. [24,25] However, this function of fiberoptic bronchoscopy is being challenged by the use of ultrasound.

          "nd systemic complications as they arise. [29,34] Here the anesthesiologists, with the bronchoscope operator, need to navigate the multiple approaches to airway management, such as apneic oxygenation, spontaneous ventilation (assisted or otherwise), controlled mechanical ventilation, high frequency, and manual jet ventilation. [32] Relative contraindications to rigid bronchoscopy include uncontrolled coagulopathy, oxygenation, and ventilator demands that are at the clinical extremes, especially in the hands of an inexperienced operator. [35]  The type and rate of complications of rigid bronchoscopy are similar to those of flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy and can likewise be divided into mechanical and systemic complications. Complications in either category can potentially result in death [Table 2].",

Due to this variety of applications, most reports of the incidence of airway fire are not specific to rigid bronchoscopy. In order to ensure the highest margin of safety in preventing airway fire, good communication must exist between the anesthesiologist and proceduralist, and the concentration of inhaled oxygen when the laser is in use should be < 40%. [33]  Standard precautions should be adhered to during laser airway procedures, especially when flammable objects (stents and endotracheal tubes) are also present in the airway.",

Usually the scope's removal for manual cleaning to visualize the field is rarely needed, and only is necessary in the face of massive hemorrhage.

[11] The pattern of these pressure changes leads to a decrease in vital capacity (as tidal volume is restricted by high pressures and is lost via bronchoscopic suction), and a decrease in forced expiratory volume secondary to obstructed exhalation, which increases auto-positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and functional residual capacity (FRC). This increase in auto-PEEP and FRC may actually protect against hypoxemia, particularly if the patient is breathing 100% oxygen, although following removal of the bronchoscope the PEEP and FRC will decrease, at this point atelectasis, bronchospasm, and laryngospasm may all lead to post-procedural hypoxemia unless treated promptly.

[11] The pattern of these pressure changes leads to a decrease in vital capacity (as tidal volume is restricted by high pressures and is lost via bronchoscopic suction), and a decrease in forced expiratory volume secondary to obstructed exhalation, which increases auto-positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and functional residual capacity (FRC). This increase in auto-PEEP and FRC may actually protect against hypoxemia, particularly if the patient is breathing 100% oxygen, although following removal of the bronchoscope the PEEP and FRC will decrease, at this point atelectasis, bronchospasm, and laryngospasm may all lead to post-procedural hypoxemia unless treated promptly. [12,13]  Prolonged suctioning during bronchoscopy can lead to further derecruitment and atelectasis, as well as worsening of post-procedural hypoxemia. [11,13]  Despite these physiologic derangements, mechanical rates of pulmonary complications remain low with rates of pneumothorax from 0.07 to 0.16%, and respiratory failure from 0.2 to 0.31% in more recent studies. [3,14]  Rates of more minor pulmonary mechanical complications including bronchospasm and laryngospasm range from 0.26 to 2%. [3,6,14]",

Additionally, it has been used to support placement of percutaneous dilational tracheostomy. [23]  It is a support adjunct to help guide the site of tracheal puncture entry of the tracheostomy, and to avoid damage to the posterior wall of the trachea. [24,25] However, this function of fiberoptic bronchoscopy is being challenged by the use of ultrasound. [26]   Advances in equipment, monitoring techniques, and anesthetic medications continue to improve the margin of safety and make this procedure widely applicable.",
          "nd systemic complications as they arise. [29,34] Here the anesthesiologists, with the bronchoscope operator, need to navigate the multiple approaches to airway management, such as apneic oxygenation, spontaneous ventilation (assisted or otherwise), controlled mechanical ventilation, high frequency, and manual jet ventilation. [32] Relative contraindications to rigid bronchoscopy include uncontrolled coagulopathy, oxygenation, and ventilator demands that are at the clinical extremes, especially in the hands of an inexperienced operator. [35]  The type and rate of complications of rigid bronchoscopy are similar to those of flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy and can likewise be divided into mechanical and systemic complications. Complications in either category can potentially result in death [Table 2].",

Due to this variety of applications, most reports of the incidence of airway fire are not specific to rigid bronchoscopy. In order to ensure the highest margin of safety in preventing airway fire, good communication must exist between the anesthesiologist and proceduralist, and the concentration of inhaled oxygen when the laser is in use should be < 40%. [33]  Standard precautions should be adhered to during laser airway procedures, especially when flammable objects (stents and endotracheal tubes) are also present in the airway.",

Usually the scope's removal for manual cleaning to visualize the field is rarely needed, and only is necessary in the face of massive hemorrhage. [41] In less than dire circumstances, the scope tip can be cleaned by gently rubbing it vertically against the mucosa of the cartilaginous part of the tracheal wall. [41]  If this maneuver does not clear the operator's vision, then place the scope as described above against the tracheal wall and flush the operating port vigorously. [41]"
