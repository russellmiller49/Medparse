A clear understanding of pathophysiology and existing classification systems is needed to determine the appropriate treatment options and predict clinical course. Clinically significant airway strictures can involve the upper and central airways extending from the subglottis to the lobar airways. Optimal evaluation includes a proper history and physical examination, neck and chest computed tomography, pulmonary function testing, endoscopy and serology. Available treatments include medical therapy, endoscopic  procedures  and  open  surgery  which  are  based  on  the  stricture ' s  extent,  location,  etiology, morphology, severity of airway narrowing and patient ' s functional status. The acuity of the process, patient ' s comorbidities and operability at the time of evaluation determine the need for open surgical or endoscopic interventions.  The  optimal  management  of  patients  with  benign  airway  strictures  requires  the  availability, expertise and collaboration of otolaryngologists, thoracic surgeons and interventional pulmonologists. Multidisciplinary airway teams can facilitate accurate diagnosis, guide management and avoid unnecessary procedures that could potentially worsen the extent of the disease or clinical course. Implementation of a complex airway  program including multidisciplinary  clinics  and  conferences  ensures  that  such  collaboration  leads  to timely,  patient-centered  and  evidence-based  interventions.  In  this  article  we  outline  algorithms  of  care  and illustrate therapeutic techniques based on published evidence."

Severe stenosis ( > 71% reduction in CSA) results in significant pressure gradient even at a low flow rates leading to symptoms at rest or mild exertion. Objective quantification of the degree of narrowing determines whether a certain airway stricture contributes to patient ' s dyspnea. There are other symptoms, however, that impact the decision-making process pertinent to treatment.

Table 1 summarizes and describes the pros and cons of each of the published classification systems [2 -8]. While the ideal system in the classification of LTS remains questionable, a recent study assessed three classification systems to effectively stratify the risk of long term tracheostomy and demonstrated that the McCaffrey and Lano systems offer more precision than the Cotton-Myer scale [9]. We believe that regardless of which classification system one uses, a proper documentation  of  laryngeal  or  tracheal  stenosis  should  be  based  on  objective criteria and include: assessment of functional impairment (eg. Dyspnea scales,  performance  status);  length  of  the  stenotic  airway;  shape (circumferential, elliptical, crescent or triangular), complexity (with or without malacia) and precise location (centimeters or number of rings below  or  above  a  specific  reference  point-vocal  cords,  cricoid,  main carina for laryngotracheal strictures or main carina, primary and secondary carinas for bronchial strictures) [10].",

            "text": "The optimal management of benign airway strictures requires the collaboration  and  availability  of  a  multidisciplinary  team,  including otolaryngology,  thoracic  surgery  and  interventional  pulmonology.  A thorough history and physical exam is essential in identifying the etiology of the stricture and its possible association with other systemic diseases  [Table  2].  This  includes  history  of  autoimmune  disorders, airway infection, previous airway instrumentation, history of endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy, prior surgery or trauma. Objective evaluation includes computed tomography (CT) of the neck and chest with  multiplanar  reconstruction  or  3D  internal  and  external  reconstruction (Fig. 1A) as well as serological tests for working up potential underlying  connective  tissue  disorders  (CTD).  Pulmonary  function testing with attention to the flow volume loops can help detect patterns of airflow obstruction and allow monitoring physiologic changes after interventions. Of note, the classic pattern of truncated inspiratory and expiratory limbs is not sensitive and may only be seen when the tracheal diameter is reduced to 6 -8 mm [11] (Fig. 1B). Patients with unilateral bronchial stenosis may present with a biphasic flow-volume loop, but these findings are also not sensitive [12]. Once non-invasive assessment is completed, the next step is to evaluate the extent and severity of the narrowing and its impact on functional status, voice and swallowing. This involves performing a flexible laryngoscopy and/or a white light bronchoscopy. Biopsies could help narrow the differential diagnosis and rule out an underlying malignant process and may help in diagnosing a benign process. Depending on the disease extent, location, etiology and operability, the care of these patients requires the expertise of a multidisciplinary  airway  team.  Endoscopic  options  include  endoscopic resection, endoscopic dilation, intralesional injection of drugs, endoluminal stents and Montgomery T-tubes. Open surgical options include a chronic indwelling tracheostomy, cricotracheal/laryngotracheal resection with primary anastomosis reconstruction. Given the multitude of techniques learned through different training pathways, major academic centers have implemented such teams for management of patients with benign airway strictures. In this article we propose a multi-disciplinary algorithmic  approach  for  the  management  of  patients  with  benign airway strictures based on currently published evidence and available local expertise [Fig. 2].",

In fact, only  56 -60%  of  the  patients  may  be  ANCA  positive  at  the  time  of diagnosis or relapse of SGS related to GPA [18,19]. Serologic testing, however, should be performed in all patients with SGS, as there is about 1  in  4  chance  of  identifying  an  underlying  connective  tissue  disease (CTD). In  a  study  of  92  patients  with  non-traumatic  LTS,  75%  were found to be idiopathic LTS, but 25% were due to autoimmune disease. In fact, this study showed that ANCA antibodies were only positive in patients with GPA with all other serological testing being equivocal between the two cohorts [20]. The histopathologic assessment in SGS often demonstrates  nonspecific  fibrosis  and  infiltration  by  neutrophils  and epithelioid histiocytes and rarely shows overt vasculitis or granulomatous disease [17 -19]. SGS can also be seen with other CTDs, such as Relapsing Polychondritis (RP). In a large case series of patients with RP, SGS was noted in 5.5% (8/145) of patients [21]. This is often associated with malacia extending to trachea and mainstem bronchi. Other possible etiologies of SGS are listed in Table 2. Despite a thorough work up, in cases when no etiology is identified, a diagnosis of iSGS is established [22 -24]. Idiopathic SGS is primarily seen in females, often in the 5th decade of life [25]. GERD can be seen in up to 65% of the patients with iSGS. There is some evidence demonstrating an imbalance between estrogen  receptor-alpha,  estrogen  receptor-beta,  and  progesterone  receptors in surgical specimens from female idiopathic subglottic stenosis patients, possibly indicating a role in inappropriate inflammation and increased stenosis susceptibility in these patients [26].",

A  metaanalysis  showed  a  success  rate  of  95%  in  patients  undergoing  LTRR [28]. In a large series, Wang et al. reported outcomes of 263 patients that underwent  LTRR  with  93.5%  (243/261)  patients  extubated  in  the operating room and 6.1% (16/261) patients requiring a temporary tracheostomy at the end of the surgery [25]. Anastomotic complications such as granulation, subcutaneous emphysema or early stenosis were noted in 11.7% (31/261) patients at the 30-days post op. On long-term follow-up (median -66 months), delayed recurrence occurred in 8.7% (23/261)  patients  with  3.4%  (9/261)  patients  requiring  repeat  laser assisted  mechanical  dilation  (LAMD)  every  6  months.  A  further follow-up survey in 180 of these patients showed that normal voice was present in 45% patients (82/180), while a change in voice occurred in 54% (96/180) patients with 67% (121/180) having a difficulty in projective voice. This is consistent with the data from a recent systematic review that also showed significantly worse voice quality in patients who underwent open resection [29]."

            "text": "There is lack of data on the role of medical therapy alone for patients with iSGS. However, studies have demonstrated a benefit from synergistic use of a combination of anti-reflux medications, oral trimethoprim-sulfamethaxazole and inhaled corticosteroids along with endoscopic therapies with a possible reduction in the rate of recurrence [27,30].  For  patients  with  iSGS,  endoscopic  resection  with  adjuvant medical therapy (ERMT) has been suggested as the first line of management.  Endoscopy  has  the  advantage  of  being  a  less  invasive  and outpatient  approach.  It  also  has  fewer  complications  than  the  open surgical approach in regards to voice-related outcomes. In a large prospective cohort study by Gelbard et al., patients who underwent ERMT were noted to have a lower recurrence rate (12.4%) compared to patients to underwent endoscopic dilation (either with a rigid instrument or  balloon  dilation)  alone  (28%)  [30,31].  Patients  who  underwent crico-tracheal resection (CTR) were noted to have the lowest recurrence (1.2%) but the open surgery was associated with the higher peri-operative risk and worse postoperative patient-related voice outcomes. However patients who underwent CTR had the most surgical procedures  performed  (mean = 5)  before  open  reconstruction  [30]. Endoscopic resection entails removal of a significant portion of the scar using  CO2 laser  [31]  or  knife  with  a ' mucosal  sparing  technique ' . Topical Mitomycin C has been used as an adjuvant treatment following mucosal sparing interventions and has been shown to reduce time to re-intervention. There is no consensus, however, on its routine use given possible complications and association with anastomotic complications in patients who underwent surgical resection [25,32,33]. When used, two applications of 0.5 mg/ml of topical mitomycin C can be considered at a 3 -4 week interval [33]. Intralesional injection of steroids can be performed as part of the ERMT procedure to potentially decrease scar tissue  formation  [34].  A  few  recent  studies  have  shown  that  serial in-office  intralesional  steroids  with  triamcinolone  40  mg/ml  using topical anesthesia 3 -6 weeks apart resulted in decreased recurrence of stenosis  and  increased  the  endoscopy  free  interval  [35,36].  If  symptomatic recurrence occurs after endoscopic intervention, surgical candidacy for an open surgical intervention for these patients should be considered."

If a patient is noted to be a poor candidate for open surgery, then"

While clinical remission rates have improved with newer pharmacologic therapies in these patients, studies suggest that SGS can prove refractory to pharmacologic therapy alone with up to 62% patient experiencing a relapse on conventional GPA therapy [18]. A recent study demonstrated that Rituximab  may  be  more  effective  than  other  conventional  GPA  therapy (methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine or TMP/SMX) in management of otolaryngologic manifestations of GPA including SGS [37]. LTRR in patients with GPA and SGS has been associated with disease relapse even in a highly selective group with 55 -75% patients requiring additional tracheal dilation and 9 -13% patients requiring a permanent tracheostomy [38,39]. In addition, patients with a systemic autoimmune disease causing SGS may also be susceptible to lower airway stenosis (mainstem  bronchial  or  lobar)  that  may  need  repeated  endoscopic procedures [40]. These include LAMD or electrocautery knife-assisted radial  incisions  with  mechanical  dilation  using  a  rigid  bronchoscope or balloon dilation along with intralesional steroids injection [15,18, 41].  Given  the  high  risk  of  recurrence  and  risk  of  developing  lower airway disease, close  clinical  and  bronchoscopic  follow  up  is  recommended in these patients to ensure early diagnosis and management. Indeed,  these  patients  will  likely  require  multiple  bronchoscopic  dilations during the course of their illness. In a study with 47 patients,"

PITS can be seen in 1 -21% of intubated patients with 1 -2% patients developing severe stenosis [44,45]. The risk factors of PITS include duration of intubation, size of endotracheal tube, cuff pressure ( ≥ 30 mm H2O), trauma during intubation and need for reintubation, infection, previous radiation  and  diabetes  mellitus.  Symptomatic  PTTS  can  be  seen  in 1.5 -1.7% patients undergoing tracheostomy [46 -48].

Silicone stents, however, may be used for long-term palliation in non-surgical candidates [54,60,62 -64]. Silicone stenting in patients with benign tracheal stenosis does not have to be a life-long intervention. Some patients may be become operable in which case the stent will be removed allowing for tracheal healing and then proceeding with surgical resection. In addition in some patients tracheal remodeling can occur after long term indwelling stenting and the stent could be removed without the need for further intervention. For example, in a large study by Dumon et al., 263 patients underwent 419 silicone stent placements for tracheal stenosis [64]. Of the 117 patients in whom the stent was removed, no recurrence was noted in 64 (25% of all cases). Overall  complications  included  migration  (9.5%),  granuloma  (7.9%) and obstruction by secretions (3.6%) justifying the practice of routine surveillance bronchoscopy.

        "abstract": "Patients referred for treatment of tracheal stenosis typically are asymptomatic until critical narrowing of the airway occurs, which then requires immediate intervention. To understand how tracheal stenosis affects local pressure drops and explore how a dramatic increase in pressure drop could possibly be detected at an early stage, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study was undertaken. We assessed flow patterns and pressure drops over tracheal stenoses artificially inserted into a realistic three-dimensional upper airway model derived from multislice computed tomography images obtained in healthy men. Solving the Navier-Stokes equations (with a Yang-shih k-epsilon turbulence model) for different degrees of tracheal constriction located approximately one tracheal diameter below the glottis, the simulated pressure drop over the stenosis (DeltaP) was seen to dramatically increase only when well over 70% of the tracheal lumen was obliterated. At 30 l/min, DeltaP increased from 7 Pa for a 50% stenosis to, respectively, 46 and 235 Pa for 80% and 90% stenosis. The pressure-flow relationship in the entire upper airway model (between mouth and end of trachea) in the flow range 0-60 l/min showed a power law relationship with best-fit flow exponent of 1.77 in the absence of stenosis. The exponent became 1.92 and 2.00 in the case of 60% and 85% constriction, respectively. The present simulations confirm that the overall pressure drop at rest is only affected in case of severe constriction, and the simulated flow dependence of pressure drop suggests a means of detecting stenosis at a precritical stage."

        "abstract": "Tracheobronchial stenosis, a serious problem in adults and children, has multiple causes and has been treated in many ways. While developing an international multicentre study to evaluate efficacy of airway stents, it was realised that no adequate description of central airway stenosis regarding type, location and degree has been published. Thus, comparing results of different treatment modalities in different centres has been difficult due to a lack of uniformity of classification. Reports are typically descriptive and precise classification schemes have not adequately addressed either for the trachea or the main bronchi. A standardised classification scheme was proposed with descriptive images and diagrams for rapid and uniform classification of central airway stenosis. The present authors' system divides stenosis into structural and dynamic types and further classifies the disease by degree of stenosis, location and transition zone. Multiple sites can be described and each is transformed into a simple numerical scoring system prompted by a diagram, which can be easily captured for subsequent uniform analysis across sites. A pilot validation of the system, with 18 pulmonologists of varying training background, showed strong precision and agreement between observers. Such a system will enhance the ability to study the effectiveness of treatment modalities for central airway stenosis."

We reviewed 41 patients who underwent 46 LT reconstructions over the past 10 years. Success was judged by the ability to decannulate patients within 1 year postoperatively. Of our patients, 63% were treated successfully, and an additional 17% had intermediate success. The techniques used for laryngotracheoplasty with augmentation grafting and tracheal resection are reviewed. Major complications, thoracic complications, and wound complications are presented. Each patient was staged by the McCaffrey staging system and Cotton grades. We propose a new staging system based on the extent of the stenosis throughout the glottis, subglottis, and trachea. It is logical and easy to use. Applied to our cases of LT stenosis retrospectively, the new system predicts clinical success (chi2, p = .05). Using contingency tables and chi2 testing for statistical evaluation, we found that diabetics have a significantly higher failure rate (chi2, p = .0002). Further, we identified a group of patients who in addition to the airway stenosis also had comorbid medical conditions that frequently necessitate a tracheostomy. These patients have a significantly higher failure rate (chi2, p = .009). Using this information and applying the staging system prior to reconstruction, we can identify patients likely to fail."

Decannulation and absence of dyspnea after exertion were the criteria of successful management. The probability of decannulation over time was computed using the Kaplan-Meier technique. Cox multiple regression analysis was used to determine the effects of independent variables (age, sex, etiology, site of stenosis, length of stenosis, diameter of stenosis, and surgical technique) on treatment success. The only factors with a significant effect on the outcome were site of stenosis and diameter of stenosis. A classification into four clinical stages of stenosis based on site of lesion was shown to effectively predict the likelihood of successful decannulation."

It follows that comparisons of therapeutic maneuvers are even more difficult. A system is proposed that is simple, reproducible, and based on a readily available reference standard. Endotracheal tubes, which are manufactured to high standards of precision and accuracy, can be used to determine the size of an obstructed airway at its smallest point. The endotracheal tube that will pass through the lumen, if one exists, and tolerate normal leak pressures (10 to 25 cm H2O), can be compared to the expected age-appropriate endotracheal tube size. By using the outside diameters of the endotracheal tubes, the maximum percentage of airway obstruction can be determined. We present a conversion of tube size to the proposed grading scale: grade I up to 50% obstruction, grade II from 51% to 70%, and grade III above 70% with any detectable lumen. An airway with no lumen is assigned to grade IV."

We review the&#xa0;published literature within the past decade on postintubation, posttracheostomy, and TB-&#xa0;and&#xa0;transplant-related airway strictures; tracheobronchomalacia; and malignant airway obstruction.&#xa0;We review terminology, classification systems, and parameters that impact treatment decisions. The focus is on how airway stent insertion fits into the best algorithm of care. Several case series and cohort studies demonstrate that airway stents improve dyspnea, lung function, and quality of life in patients with airway obstruction. Airway stenting, however, is associated with high rates of adverse events and should be used only when curative open surgical interventions&#xa0;are not feasible or are contraindicated."

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a systemic inflammatory condition with pulmonary manifestations that may be infiltrative (e.g., pneumonia), hemorrhagic, and may rarely cause bronchial stenosis. Herein, we present a case of GPA-related, bronchial obstruction that caused biphasic flow-volume loop along with a literature review."

Historically, patients were treated with dilation or ablation, however this approach has proven to be largely palliative and often leads to recurrence and the need for tracheostomy. A single-staged laryngotracheal resection and reconstruction is now the preferred definitive treatment for idiopathic subglottic stenosis and can be performed with excellent patient outcomes and rare subsequent progression of the disease. Avoiding anastomotic tension and devascularization are important technical keys to minimizing complications."

Among 158 patients treated at the National Institutes of Health during the past 24 years, 145 (92%) had an otolaryngologic manifestation of their disease and 25 (16%) had subglottic stenosis (SGS). SGS varied from asymptomatic to life-threatening. Sixteen (80%) of 20 patients with fixed SGS required surgical intervention, including manual dilations, carbon-dioxide laser resections, and laryngotracheoplasty (LTP). LTP was performed with and without microvascular reconstruction. Thirteen of the patients required tracheostomy and all 13 were ultimately decannulated. Five patients who repeatedly failed dilations and/or endoscopic laser surgery underwent LTP. Since 1987, two patients have undergone LTP with microvascular free flaps. Both patients were subsequently decannulated. The authors' experience demonstrates that management of SGS in WG is complex, requiring individualized frequent multimodality interventions to achieve satisfactory results. Microvascular laryngotracheal reconstruction should be considered in the surgical armamentarium for patients with persistent stenoses."

Of the 51 patients with biopsy-proven WG who underwent bronchoscopy at least once at our institution between January 1982 and November 1993, 30 (59%) had endobronchial abnormalities due to WG. Initial findings included subglottic stenosis in five (17%), ulcerating tracheobronchitis with or without inflammatory pseudotumors in 18 (60%), tracheal or bronchial stenosis without inflammation in four (13%), and hemorrhage without identifiable source in two (4%) patients. Nine patients with ulcerating tracheobronchitis on initial study had subsequent bronchoscopies for continued symptoms, which in seven cases documented the progression from ulcerating tracheobronchitis to stenosis without inflammation. Bronchoscopic interventions included dilation by rigid bronchoscope in three, YAG-laser treatment in one, and placement of silastic airway stents in three patients. Only the stents provided persistent airway patency. Endobronchial biopsies were performed on 21 occasions in 17 patients. Half of the specimens were helpful in establishing the diagnosis and in all but three in assessing disease activity. While antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody titers reflect overall disease activity, no correlation with endobronchial inflammatory activity was apparent."

Subglottic stenosis developed in 6 out of 51 (11.7%) patients, in four of them in the absence of other features of active disease, and was the symptom that leads to WG diagnosis in three cases. In two cases, SGS began while the patients were receiving systemic immunosuppressive therapy for disease activity involving other sites. PR3-ANCAs were positive in four cases. An urgent tracheostomy was needed in two patients. Four patients achieved SGS clinical remission on standard treatment with glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide, but three of them experienced repeated local relapses and required additional immunosuppressive therapy and mechanical dilations. In one case, a local relapse was successfully managed with endotracheal dilation of the stenotic segment and intralesional injection of a long-acting corticosteroid plus mechanical dilation of the stenotic segment (ILCD) without adding supplemental immunosuppressant drugs. Two patients with isolated SGS were also successfully managed with ILCD alone and did not require the institution of systemic immunosuppressive therapy. One patient underwent open surgical repair when the disease was under control. Our data suggest that Subglottic stenosis often occurs or progresses independently of other features of active WG, and that ILCD may be a safe alternative to conventional immunosuppressive therapy in patients who develop SGS in the absence of other features of active disease, allowing reducing the treatment-related toxicity."

There is an overwhelming female preponderance, and treatment usually involves dilation, tracheostomy or resection with reconstruction of the involved portion of the airway. The exact mechanism of action is unknown. Estrogen has been thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of this disease, but estrogen receptors have not been found in tissue specimens taken from afflicted individuals. A careful history taken from the patient often reveals a severe episode of coughing prior to the development of symptoms, and intraoperative examination can reveal impaction of the first tracheal ring within the lumen of the cricoid cartilage. Based on these observations, we surmise that an intermittent telescoping effect of the first tracheal ring within the lumen of the cricoid cartilage can lead to disruption of the local blood supply and trauma to the cricoid mucosa, with consequent mucosal edema, ischemia, and ultimately fibrosis. While estrogen has been shown to play a beneficial role in wound healing, abnormal wound healing may be potentiated by variations in estrogen receptor expression, and could also explain the female preponderance seen in this disease."

        "abstract": "Idiopathic subglottic stenosis (iSGS) is a fibrotic disease of unclear etiology that produces obstruction of the central airway in the anatomic region under the glottis. The diagnosis of this entity is difficult, usually delayed and confounded with other common respiratory diseases. No apparent etiology is identified even after a comprehensive workup that includes a complete history, physical examination, pulmonary function testing, auto-antibodies, imaging studies, and endoscopic procedures. This approach, however, helps to exclude other conditions such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). It is also helpful to characterize the lesion and outline management strategies. Therapeutic endoscopic procedures and surgery are the most common management modalities, but medical therapy can also play a significant role in preventing or delaying recurrence. In this review, we describe the morphology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, evaluation, management, and prognosis of iSGS."

The disease is characterised by mucosal inflammation and localised fibrosis resulting in life-threatening blockage of the upper airway. Because of high recurrence rates, patients with iSGS will frequently require multiple procedures following their initial diagnosis. Both the disease and its therapies profoundly affect patients' ability to breathe, communicate and swallow. A variety of treatments have been advanced to manage this condition. However, comparative data on effectiveness and side effects of the unique approaches have never been systematically evaluated. This study will create an international, multi-institutional prospective cohort of patients with iSGS. It will compare three surgical approaches to determine how well the most commonly used treatments in iSGS 'work' and what quality of life (QOL) trade-offs are associated with each approach."

Seventy-four percent of these patients (n = 32) had intrinsic tracheal stenosis, most frequently as a complication of prolonged endotracheal trauma. A total of 41 distinctly separate stenotic segments were identified in the 32 patients. The stenoses were considered moderate or severe in 33 (80%) of the 41 cases and the length of the stenotic segment was greater than 1 cm in 23 (56%) of the cases. An overall 70% success rate was achieved following 93 surgical procedures in this group. The concurrent presence of glottic/subglottic stenosis, multiple segments of stenosis, bilateral vocal cord paralysis, tracheoesophageal fistula, and a tendency to marked hypertrophic scar formation were found to be significant factors in the surgical management of this patient group."

        "abstract": "Objective To determine the incidence of posttracheostomy tracheal stenosis and to investigate variables related to the patient, hospitalization, or operation that may affect stenosis rates. Study Design A combined retrospective cohort and case-control study. Setting Tertiary care academic medical center. Subjects and Methods A total of 1656 patients who underwent tracheostomy at a tertiary care medical center from January 2011 to November 2016 were reviewed for evidence of subsequent tracheal stenosis on airway endoscopy or computed tomography. Forty-three confirmed cases of posttracheostomy tracheal stenosis (PTTS) were compared with a subgroup of 319 controls. Factors including medical comorbidity, type and setting of tracheostomy, and hospitalization details were analyzed. Results Five-year incidence of PTTS was 2.6%. Obesity was the sole demographic factor associated with stenosis. Hospitalization-related variables associated with stenosis included tracheostomy after 10 days of orotracheal intubation and endotracheal tube cuff pressure &#x2265;30 mm H<sub>2</sub>O. The surgical variables associated with higher rates of stenosis included percutaneous technique and insertion of an initial tracheostomy tube size &gt;6. Bjork flap creation was negatively associated with stenosis. In multivariable analysis, obesity and insertion of tracheostomy tube size &gt;6 were identified as risk factors. Conclusion Greater than 10 days of orotracheal intubation prior to tracheostomy and endotracheal tube cuff pressure &#x2265;30 mm H<sub>2</sub>O were associated with greater rates of subsequent tracheal stenosis. The only patient-related factor associated with tracheal stenosis was obesity. Surgical variables associated with increased rates of subsequent stenosis included placement of a tracheostomy tube size &gt;6, use of percutaneous technique, and failure to create a Bjork flap."

        "abstract": "Treatment of tracheal stenosis varies with the type and extent of the disease. Tracheostomy with stents, end-to-end anastomosis, or extensive reconstructive procedures often is required, especially when tracheomalacia is present. High recurrence rate is associated with relatively less invasive endotracheal treatments, such as bougie dilatation or total laser ablation. Mucosal sparing technique using Nd:YAG laser photodissection (LPD) and gentle dilatation (GD) can provide durable successful results in selected patients with benign concentric tracheal stenosis (CTS). In our study of 18 patients with CTS, 12 were successfully treated with Nd:YAG LPD and GD. Of these patients, eight required a single treatment while four required two or more treatments. No patients required new tracheostomy to carry out the procedure. Follow-up periods ranging from 2 to 85 months (mean: 32.6 +/- 1.5 months) for 12 successfully treated patients have revealed no recurrence of their stenosis. Lengthy scars (&gt; 1 cm) and tracheomalacia were the clinical features common to those patients who failed the treatment. We advocate the use of Nd:YAG LPD in conjunction with \"gentle\" rigid bronchoscopic dilatation as the initial treatment of CTS."

Interventional bronchoscopic procedures have been reported to be of help in weaning patients with malignant airway stenoses from mechanical ventilation, whereas their use in benign disease is only anecdotal. The objectives of this study are to evaluate early, intermediate and long-term outcome of interventional bronchoscopy and stent placement in the treatment of MV/AA dependency due to benign airway obstruction. In a retrospective cohort analysis for the period 1999-2004, we evaluated 15 consecutive ICU patients with documented benign central airway obstruction, who were referred for bronchoscopic management of their condition after multiple failed attempts at weaning from MV or decannulation of the AA. Indications for bronchoscopic treatment were surgery refusal, medical or surgical inoperability, or absence of alternative treatment options. Malacia, post-intubation stenosis and goiter were the main causes of airway obstruction and MV/AA dependency. All patients were treated by means of rigid bronchoscopy, dilatation procedures and stent insertion. All but one patient (93.3%) were successfully and permanently extubated/decanulated immediately after the bronchoscopy. Minor complications occurred in 6 patients (40%) leading to a second intervention. All complications could be managed endoscopically and long-term follow up was uneventful. Interventional bronchoscopy with stent insertion can allow successful withdrawal from MV/AA and can offer longstanding airway patency in selected ventilator- or tracheostomy-dependant individuals with benign airway stenoses,when surgery in not feasable or contra-indicated."

Healing of this anastomosis is one source of postoperative complications especially after double lung transplantation (DLT). In this series of 10 patients with cystic fibrosis undergoing DLT, the tracheas of donor and recipient were anastomosed with omental wrapping in 2 cases while the two main stem bronchi were joined without omental wrapping in 8. Endoscopy disclosed no sign of ischaemia in the patients with bilateral bronchial anastomoses. Three patients died on day 20, 21 and 35, respectively, after DLT. Two of these patients (one with a tracheal and the other with bronchial anastomoses) showed no complication at the level of the suture line. The third patient (with bronchial suture) suffered dehiscence of both anastomoses which was attributed to a misdosage of corticosteroids. Of the 6 patients alive after bronchial anastomosis, 3 recovered uneventfully and 3 who had required prolonged postoperative mechanical ventilation developed bronchomalacia. Bronchomalacia was treated by laser resection and stenting. Dehiscence did not occur in any of these six cases. This technique was based on the findings of 12 fresh cadaver dissections showing that collaterals between the bronchial arteries and the pulmonary arteries and veins extend up to the origin of the main stem bronchus. Bronchial suture without omental wrap may be used for double lung and heart-lung transplantation instead of tracheal suture."

Less commonly, the airways are involved, and the disease is manifested as mucosal erythema, edema, granularity and cobblestoning, plaques, nodules, and bronchial stenosis, airway distortion, traction bronchiectasis, and bronchiolitis. Airway involvement may lead to airflow limitation. Involvement of oral, nasal, and pharyngeal mucosa may cause hoarseness, dysphagia, laryngeal paralysis, and upper airway obstruction. Airway symptoms are important indicators of airway involvement in sarcoidosis. Pulmonary function testing, radiologic imaging, and bronchoscopy occupy a significant role in the diagnosis and management of airway involvement in patients with sarcoidosis."

We describe our experience using self-expanding metallic stents to treat post-lung transplant bronchial dehiscence. From January 1995 to June 2004, 189 single and 118 double lung transplants were performed in our institution, totaling 425 at-risk bronchial anastomoses. Seven (1.6%) incidents of life-threatening bronchial dehiscence were treated with self-expanding metallic stents. The interval between transplant and diagnosis of dehiscence was 29.1 +/- 18.5 days. All patients presented with respiratory distress, and three required mechanical ventilation. Self-expanding metallic stent placement resulted in complete bronchial healing. All three patients with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation were successfully weaned after stent placement. In two later cases, the stents were electively removed after adequate healing of the dehiscence. Complications included stent migration (one patient) and in-stent stenosis (three patients). Two of these patients required repeat stent insertion after removal, due to bronchomalacia. In patients with life-threatening bronchial dehiscence, self-expanding metallic stents offer prospects for a successful outcome. Self-expanding metallic stents are known to be associated with significant granulation tissue formation, and this property provides a platform for healing of dehiscence and, in time, peribronchial soft tissue grows in to cover the defect, allowing stent removal."

Moderate stenosis (51 -70% reduction in CSA) could  cause  symptoms  on  exertion  with  a  significant  pressure  drop occurring at higher flow rates. Severe stenosis ( > 71% reduction in CSA) results in significant pressure gradient even at a low flow rates leading to symptoms at rest or mild exertion. Objective quantification of the degree of narrowing determines whether a certain airway stricture contributes to patient ' s dyspnea. There are other symptoms, however, that impact the decision-making process pertinent to treatment. Patients with laryngotracheal stenosis (LTS) can have symptoms other than dyspnea such as dysphagia and dysphonia. In fact, some classification systems address",

          "ourse [17], a negative ANCA does not permit exclusion of GPA. In fact, only  56 -60%  of  the  patients  may  be  ANCA  positive  at  the  time  of diagnosis or relapse of SGS related to GPA [18,19]. Serologic testing, however, should be performed in all patients with SGS, as there is about 1  in  4  chance  of  identifying  an  underlying  connective  tissue  disease (CTD). In  a  study  of  92  patients  with  non-traumatic  LTS,  75%  were found to be idiopathic LTS, but 25% were due to autoimmune disease. In fact, this study showed that ANCA antibodies were only positive in patients with GPA with all other serological testing being equivocal between the two cohorts [20]. The histopathologic assessment in SGS often demonstrates  nonspecific  fibrosis  and  infiltration  by  neutrophils  and epithelioid histiocytes and rarely shows overt vasculitis or granulomatous disease [17 -19]. SGS can also be seen with other CTDs, such as Relapsing Polychondritis (RP). In a large case series of patients with RP, SGS was noted in 5.5% (8/145) of patients [21]. This is often associated with malacia extending to trachea and mainstem bronchi. Other possible etiologies of SGS are listed in Table 2. Despite a thorough work up, in cases when no etiology is identified, a diagnosis of iSGS is established [22 -24]. Idiopathic SGS is primarily seen in females, often in the 5th decade of life [25]. GERD can be seen in up to 65% of the patients with iSGS. There is some evidence demonstrating an imbalance between estrogen  receptor-alpha,  estrogen  receptor-beta,  and  progesterone  receptors in surgical specimens from female idiopathic subglottic stenosis patients, possibly indicating a role in inappropriate inflammation and increased stenosis susceptibility in these patients [26].",

The inherent disadvantage of a T-tube is the need for a tracheostomy as compared to a dedicated endoluminal stent. It also requires patient compliance with pulmonary hygiene measures including but not limited to saline nebulization, deep breathing exercises  and  self-suctioning.  It  thus  can  significantly  compromise  the quality of life. In our opinion, T -tubes should be reserved for patients who are not surgical candidates for  open resection and endoluminal stent placement that is associated with recurrent stent-related complications.",

For patients with a complex stenosis with a  long  segment  lesion  ( > 1  cm)  or  associated  cartilage  involvement, surgical resection of the involved airway segment is the preferred modality and should be offered before any endoscopic attempts. In fact, some endoscopic procedures (i.e. stenting) may lengthen the extent of the  narrow  segment  potentially  precluding  a  curative-intent  surgical resection [56].",
          "f placement via flexible bronchoscopy, the US Food and Drug Administration has recommended against the use of SEMS for benign airway stenosis due to excessive granulation formation, airway injury and stent fracture [10,61]. Silicone stents, however, may be used for long-term palliation in non-surgical candidates [54,60,62 -64]. Silicone stenting in patients with benign tracheal stenosis does not have to be a life-long intervention. Some patients may be become operable in which case the stent will be removed allowing for tracheal healing and then proceeding with surgical resection. In addition in some patients tracheal remodeling can occur after long term indwelling stenting and the stent could be removed without the need for further intervention. For example, in a large study by Dumon et al., 263 patients underwent 419 silicone stent placements for tracheal stenosis [64]. Of the 117 patients in whom the stent was removed, no recurrence was noted in 64 (25% of all cases). Overall  complications  included  migration  (9.5%),  granuloma  (7.9%) and obstruction by secretions (3.6%) justifying the practice of routine surveillance bronchoscopy. Similarly, in another 2 studies where 47 and 55  patients  underwent  stent  placement  for  PITS,  successful  stent removal  was  possible  in  47%  (22/47)  and  40%  (22/55)  patients, respectively, without need for further interventions [54,62].",

In patients with bronchial stenosis with connective tissue  disorders  such  as  GPA,  pharmacologic  therapy  remains  the mainstay of treatment. Endoscopic interventions with LAMD or electrocautery assisted mechanical dilation may be used in refractory patients  with  clinical  symptoms  (Fig.  5B).  Long-term  bronchoscopic surveillance is required in these patients due to the risk of recurrence and thus close outpatient follow-up is recommended.",

Moderate stenosis (51 -70% reduction in CSA) could  cause  symptoms  on  exertion  with  a  significant  pressure  drop occurring at higher flow rates. Severe stenosis ( > 71% reduction in CSA) results in significant pressure gradient even at a low flow rates leading to symptoms at rest or mild exertion. Objective quantification of the degree of narrowing determines whether a certain airway stricture contributes to patient ' s dyspnea. There are other symptoms, however, that impact the decision-making process pertinent to treatment. Patients with laryngotracheal stenosis (LTS) can have symptoms other than dyspnea such as dysphagia and dysphonia. In fact, some classification systems address",

          "ourse [17], a negative ANCA does not permit exclusion of GPA. In fact, only  56 -60%  of  the  patients  may  be  ANCA  positive  at  the  time  of diagnosis or relapse of SGS related to GPA [18,19]. Serologic testing, however, should be performed in all patients with SGS, as there is about 1  in  4  chance  of  identifying  an  underlying  connective  tissue  disease (CTD). In  a  study  of  92  patients  with  non-traumatic  LTS,  75%  were found to be idiopathic LTS, but 25% were due to autoimmune disease. In fact, this study showed that ANCA antibodies were only positive in patients with GPA with all other serological testing being equivocal between the two cohorts [20]. The histopathologic assessment in SGS often demonstrates  nonspecific  fibrosis  and  infiltration  by  neutrophils  and epithelioid histiocytes and rarely shows overt vasculitis or granulomatous disease [17 -19]. SGS can also be seen with other CTDs, such as Relapsing Polychondritis (RP). In a large case series of patients with RP, SGS was noted in 5.5% (8/145) of patients [21]. This is often associated with malacia extending to trachea and mainstem bronchi. Other possible etiologies of SGS are listed in Table 2. Despite a thorough work up, in cases when no etiology is identified, a diagnosis of iSGS is established [22 -24]. Idiopathic SGS is primarily seen in females, often in the 5th decade of life [25]. GERD can be seen in up to 65% of the patients with iSGS. There is some evidence demonstrating an imbalance between estrogen  receptor-alpha,  estrogen  receptor-beta,  and  progesterone  receptors in surgical specimens from female idiopathic subglottic stenosis patients, possibly indicating a role in inappropriate inflammation and increased stenosis susceptibility in these patients [26].",
          "epeated  endoscopic  interventions  with  adjuvant  local  and  medical therapy should be the mainstay of treatment and based on symptoms. A T-tube placement could be considered in refractory patients with need for repeat frequent interventions.",
          "fter the first endoscopic procedure, the cumulative incidence of endoscopic treatment failure was 50% at 1 year, 70% at 2 years and 80% at 5 years [42].",
          "ubglottic edema and retention of secretions. There are life-threatening complications due to obstruction of the T tube by thick gluey secretions [52] and mucus plugging. The inherent disadvantage of a T-tube is the need for a tracheostomy as compared to a dedicated endoluminal stent. It also requires patient compliance with pulmonary hygiene measures including but not limited to saline nebulization, deep breathing exercises  and  self-suctioning.  It  thus  can  significantly  compromise  the quality of life. In our opinion, T -tubes should be reserved for patients who are not surgical candidates for  open resection and endoluminal stent placement that is associated with recurrent stent-related complications.",
          "alloon tracheoplasty [54,55]. For patients with a complex stenosis with a  long  segment  lesion  ( > 1  cm)  or  associated  cartilage  involvement, surgical resection of the involved airway segment is the preferred modality and should be offered before any endoscopic attempts. In fact, some endoscopic procedures (i.e. stenting) may lengthen the extent of the  narrow  segment  potentially  precluding  a  curative-intent  surgical resection [56].",
          "f placement via flexible bronchoscopy, the US Food and Drug Administration has recommended against the use of SEMS for benign airway stenosis due to excessive granulation formation, airway injury and stent fracture [10,61]. Silicone stents, however, may be used for long-term palliation in non-surgical candidates [54,60,62 -64]. Silicone stenting in patients with benign tracheal stenosis does not have to be a life-long intervention. Some patients may be become operable in which case the stent will be removed allowing for tracheal healing and then proceeding with surgical resection. In addition in some patients tracheal remodeling can occur after long term indwelling stenting and the stent could be removed without the need for further intervention. For example, in a large study by Dumon et al., 263 patients underwent 419 silicone stent placements for tracheal stenosis [64]. Of the 117 patients in whom the stent was removed, no recurrence was noted in 64 (25% of all cases). Overall  complications  included  migration  (9.5%),  granuloma  (7.9%) and obstruction by secretions (3.6%) justifying the practice of routine surveillance bronchoscopy. Similarly, in another 2 studies where 47 and 55  patients  underwent  stent  placement  for  PITS,  successful  stent removal  was  possible  in  47%  (22/47)  and  40%  (22/55)  patients, respectively, without need for further interventions [54,62].",
          "ndoscopic management and optimization of the immunosuppressive therapy.  Bronchial  stenosis  has  also  been  reported  in  patients  with sarcoidosis with the incidence ranging from 1 to 18% [71,72], but this is often  due  to  compression  from  large  mediastinal,  hilar  or  interlobar adenopathy, rather than a true airway stricture. The various etiologies of bronchial stenosis are listed in Table 2.",
          "trictures  have  also  been  treated  with  endoscopic  interventions  such as LAMD or balloon dilation after a electrocautery knife-assisted incision but  often  need  long-term  stenting  ( > 12 months) to maintain airway patency [10,77,78]. In patients with bronchial stenosis with connective tissue  disorders  such  as  GPA,  pharmacologic  therapy  remains  the mainstay of treatment. Endoscopic interventions with LAMD or electrocautery assisted mechanical dilation may be used in refractory patients  with  clinical  symptoms  (Fig.  5B).  Long-term  bronchoscopic surveillance is required in these patients due to the risk of recurrence and thus close outpatient follow-up is recommended.",

Moderate stenosis (51 -70% reduction in CSA) could  cause  symptoms  on  exertion  with  a  significant  pressure  drop occurring at higher flow rates. Severe stenosis ( > 71% reduction in CSA) results in significant pressure gradient even at a low flow rates leading to symptoms at rest or mild exertion. Objective quantification of the degree of narrowing determines whether a certain airway stricture contributes to patient ' s dyspnea. There are other symptoms, however, that impact the decision-making process pertinent to treatment. Patients with laryngotracheal stenosis (LTS) can have symptoms other than dyspnea such as dysphagia and dysphonia. In fact, some classification systems address",

          "ourse [17], a negative ANCA does not permit exclusion of GPA. In fact, only  56 -60%  of  the  patients  may  be  ANCA  positive  at  the  time  of diagnosis or relapse of SGS related to GPA [18,19]. Serologic testing, however, should be performed in all patients with SGS, as there is about 1  in  4  chance  of  identifying  an  underlying  connective  tissue  disease (CTD). In  a  study  of  92  patients  with  non-traumatic  LTS,  75%  were found to be idiopathic LTS, but 25% were due to autoimmune disease. In fact, this study showed that ANCA antibodies were only positive in patients with GPA with all other serological testing being equivocal between the two cohorts [20]. The histopathologic assessment in SGS often demonstrates  nonspecific  fibrosis  and  infiltration  by  neutrophils  and epithelioid histiocytes and rarely shows overt vasculitis or granulomatous disease [17 -19]. SGS can also be seen with other CTDs, such as Relapsing Polychondritis (RP). In a large case series of patients with RP, SGS was noted in 5.5% (8/145) of patients [21]. This is often associated with malacia extending to trachea and mainstem bronchi. Other possible etiologies of SGS are listed in Table 2. Despite a thorough work up, in cases when no etiology is identified, a diagnosis of iSGS is established [22 -24]. Idiopathic SGS is primarily seen in females, often in the 5th decade of life [25]. GERD can be seen in up to 65% of the patients with iSGS. There is some evidence demonstrating an imbalance between estrogen  receptor-alpha,  estrogen  receptor-beta,  and  progesterone  receptors in surgical specimens from female idiopathic subglottic stenosis patients, possibly indicating a role in inappropriate inflammation and increased stenosis susceptibility in these patients [26].",
          "epeated  endoscopic  interventions  with  adjuvant  local  and  medical therapy should be the mainstay of treatment and based on symptoms. A T-tube placement could be considered in refractory patients with need for repeat frequent interventions.",

          "ubglottic edema and retention of secretions. There are life-threatening complications due to obstruction of the T tube by thick gluey secretions [52] and mucus plugging. The inherent disadvantage of a T-tube is the need for a tracheostomy as compared to a dedicated endoluminal stent. It also requires patient compliance with pulmonary hygiene measures including but not limited to saline nebulization, deep breathing exercises  and  self-suctioning.  It  thus  can  significantly  compromise  the quality of life. In our opinion, T -tubes should be reserved for patients who are not surgical candidates for  open resection and endoluminal stent placement that is associated with recurrent stent-related complications.",

For patients with a complex stenosis with a  long  segment  lesion  ( > 1  cm)  or  associated  cartilage  involvement, surgical resection of the involved airway segment is the preferred modality and should be offered before any endoscopic attempts. In fact, some endoscopic procedures (i.e. stenting) may lengthen the extent of the  narrow  segment  potentially  precluding  a  curative-intent  surgical resection [56].",
          "f placement via flexible bronchoscopy, the US Food and Drug Administration has recommended against the use of SEMS for benign airway stenosis due to excessive granulation formation, airway injury and stent fracture [10,61]. Silicone stents, however, may be used for long-term palliation in non-surgical candidates [54,60,62 -64]. Silicone stenting in patients with benign tracheal stenosis does not have to be a life-long intervention. Some patients may be become operable in which case the stent will be removed allowing for tracheal healing and then proceeding with surgical resection. In addition in some patients tracheal remodeling can occur after long term indwelling stenting and the stent could be removed without the need for further intervention. For example, in a large study by Dumon et al., 263 patients underwent 419 silicone stent placements for tracheal stenosis [64]. Of the 117 patients in whom the stent was removed, no recurrence was noted in 64 (25% of all cases). Overall  complications  included  migration  (9.5%),  granuloma  (7.9%) and obstruction by secretions (3.6%) justifying the practice of routine surveillance bronchoscopy. Similarly, in another 2 studies where 47 and 55  patients  underwent  stent  placement  for  PITS,  successful  stent removal  was  possible  in  47%  (22/47)  and  40%  (22/55)  patients, respectively, without need for further interventions [54,62].",

Bronchial  stenosis  has  also  been  reported  in  patients  with sarcoidosis with the incidence ranging from 1 to 18% [71,72], but this is often  due  to  compression  from  large  mediastinal,  hilar  or  interlobar adenopathy, rather than a true airway stricture. The various etiologies of bronchial stenosis are listed in Table 2.",

In patients with bronchial stenosis with connective tissue  disorders  such  as  GPA,  pharmacologic  therapy  remains  the mainstay of treatment. Endoscopic interventions with LAMD or electrocautery assisted mechanical dilation may be used in refractory patients  with  clinical  symptoms  (Fig.  5B).  Long-term  bronchoscopic surveillance is required in these patients due to the risk of recurrence and thus close outpatient follow-up is recommended.",

Some patients may be become operable in which case the stent will be removed allowing for tracheal healing and then proceeding with surgical resection. In addition in some patients tracheal remodeling can occur after long term indwelling stenting and the stent could be removed without the need for further intervention. For example, in a large study by Dumon et al., 263 patients underwent 419 silicone stent placements for tracheal stenosis [64].

          ") as well as serological tests for working up potential underlying  connective  tissue  disorders  (CTD).  Pulmonary  function testing with attention to the flow volume loops can help detect patterns of airflow obstruction and allow monitoring physiologic changes after interventions. Of note, the classic pattern of truncated inspiratory and expiratory limbs is not sensitive and may only be seen when the tracheal diameter is reduced to 6 -8 mm [11] (Fig. 1B). Patients with unilateral bronchial stenosis may present with a biphasic flow-volume loop, but these findings are also not sensitive [12]. Once non-invasive assessment is completed, the next step is to evaluate the extent and severity of the narrowing and its impact on functional status, voice and swallowing. This involves performing a flexible laryngoscopy and/or a white light bronchoscopy. Biopsies could help narrow the differential diagnosis and rule out an underlying malignant process and may help in diagnosing a benign process. Depending on the disease extent, location, etiology and operability, the care of these patients requires the expertise of a multidisciplinary  airway  team.  Endoscopic  options  include  endoscopic resection, endoscopic dilation, intralesional injection of drugs, endoluminal stents and Montgomery T-tubes. Open surgical options include a chronic indwelling tracheostomy, cricotracheal/laryngotracheal resection with primary anastomosis reconstruction. Given the multitude of techniques learned through different training pathways, major academic centers have implemented such teams for management of patients with benign airway strictures. In this article we propose a multi-disciplinary algorithmic  approach  for  the  management  of  patients  with  benign airway strictures based on currently published evidence and available local expertise [Fig. 2]."

Pulmonary  function testing with attention to the flow volume loops can help detect patterns of airflow obstruction and allow monitoring physiologic changes after interventions. Of note, the classic pattern of truncated inspiratory and expiratory limbs is not sensitive and may only be seen when the tracheal diameter is reduced to 6 -8 mm [11] (Fig. 1B). Patients with unilateral bronchial stenosis may present with a biphasic flow-volume loop, but these findings are also not sensitive [12]. Once non-invasive assessment is completed, the next step is to evaluate the extent and severity of the narrowing and its impact on functional status, voice and swallowing. This involves performing a flexible laryngoscopy and/or a white light bronchoscopy. Biopsies could help narrow the differential diagnosis and rule out an underlying malignant process and may help in diagnosing a benign process. Depending on the disease extent, location, etiology and operability, the care of these patients requires the expertise of a multidisciplinary  airway  team.  Endoscopic  options  include  endoscopic resection, endoscopic dilation, intralesional injection of drugs, endoluminal stents and Montgomery T-tubes. Open surgical options include a chronic indwelling tracheostomy, cricotracheal/laryngotracheal resection with primary anastomosis reconstruction. Given the multitude of techniques learned through different training pathways, major academic centers have implemented such teams for management of patients with benign airway strictures. In this article we propose a multi-disciplinary algorithmic  approach  for  the  management  of  patients  with  benign airway strictures based on currently published evidence and available local expertise [Fig. 2]."

In  a  study  of  92  patients  with  non-traumatic  LTS,  75%  were found to be idiopathic LTS, but 25% were due to autoimmune disease. In fact, this study showed that ANCA antibodies were only positive in patients with GPA with all other serological testing being equivocal between the two cohorts [20]. The histopathologic assessment in SGS often demonstrates  nonspecific  fibrosis  and  infiltration  by  neutrophils  and epithelioid histiocytes and rarely shows overt vasculitis or granulomatous disease [17 -19]. SGS can also be seen with other CTDs, such as Relapsing Polychondritis (RP). In a large case series of patients with RP, SGS was noted in 5.5% (8/145) of patients [21]. This is often associated with malacia extending to trachea and mainstem bronchi. Other possible etiologies of SGS are listed in Table 2. Despite a thorough work up, in cases when no etiology is identified, a diagnosis of iSGS is established [22 -24]. Idiopathic SGS is primarily seen in females, often in the 5th decade of life [25]. GERD can be seen in up to 65% of the patients with iSGS.

Silicone stenting in patients with benign tracheal stenosis does not have to be a life-long intervention. Some patients may be become operable in which case the stent will be removed allowing for tracheal healing and then proceeding with surgical resection. In addition in some patients tracheal remodeling can occur after long term indwelling stenting and the stent could be removed without the need for further intervention. For example, in a large study by Dumon et al., 263 patients underwent 419 silicone stent placements for tracheal stenosis [64]. Of the 117 patients in whom the stent was removed, no recurrence was noted in 64 (25% of all cases).

Of note, the classic pattern of truncated inspiratory and expiratory limbs is not sensitive and may only be seen when the tracheal diameter is reduced to 6 -8 mm [11] (Fig. 1B). Patients with unilateral bronchial stenosis may present with a biphasic flow-volume loop, but these findings are also not sensitive [12]. Once non-invasive assessment is completed, the next step is to evaluate the extent and severity of the narrowing and its impact on functional status, voice and swallowing. This involves performing a flexible laryngoscopy and/or a white light bronchoscopy. Biopsies could help narrow the differential diagnosis and rule out an underlying malignant process and may help in diagnosing a benign process. Depending on the disease extent, location, etiology and operability, the care of these patients requires the expertise of a multidisciplinary  airway  team.  Endoscopic  options  include  endoscopic resection, endoscopic dilation, intralesional injection of drugs, endoluminal stents and Montgomery T-tubes. Open surgical options include a chronic indwelling tracheostomy, cricotracheal/laryngotracheal resection with primary anastomosis reconstruction. Given the multitude of techniques learned through different training pathways, major academic centers have implemented such teams for management of patients with benign airway strictures. In this article we propose a multi-disciplinary algorithmic  approach  for  the  management  of  patients  with  benign airway strictures based on currently published evidence and available local expertise [Fig. 2]."

Moderate stenosis (51 -70% reduction in CSA) could  cause  symptoms  on  exertion  with  a  significant  pressure  drop occurring at higher flow rates. Severe stenosis ( > 71% reduction in CSA) results in significant pressure gradient even at a low flow rates leading to symptoms at rest or mild exertion. Objective quantification of the degree of narrowing determines whether a certain airway stricture contributes to patient ' s dyspnea. There are other symptoms, however, that impact the decision-making process pertinent to treatment.

In fact, only  56 -60%  of  the  patients  may  be  ANCA  positive  at  the  time  of diagnosis or relapse of SGS related to GPA [18,19]. Serologic testing, however, should be performed in all patients with SGS, as there is about 1  in  4  chance  of  identifying  an  underlying  connective  tissue  disease (CTD). In  a  study  of  92  patients  with  non-traumatic  LTS,  75%  were found to be idiopathic LTS, but 25% were due to autoimmune disease. In fact, this study showed that ANCA antibodies were only positive in patients with GPA with all other serological testing being equivocal between the two cohorts [20]. The histopathologic assessment in SGS often demonstrates  nonspecific  fibrosis  and  infiltration  by  neutrophils  and epithelioid histiocytes and rarely shows overt vasculitis or granulomatous disease [17 -19]. SGS can also be seen with other CTDs, such as Relapsing Polychondritis (RP). In a large case series of patients with RP, SGS was noted in 5.5% (8/145) of patients [21]. This is often associated with malacia extending to trachea and mainstem bronchi. Other possible etiologies of SGS are listed in Table 2. Despite a thorough work up, in cases when no etiology is identified, a diagnosis of iSGS is established [22 -24]. Idiopathic SGS is primarily seen in females, often in the 5th decade of life [25]. GERD can be seen in up to 65% of the patients with iSGS. There is some evidence demonstrating an imbalance between estrogen  receptor-alpha,  estrogen  receptor-beta,  and  progesterone  receptors in surgical specimens from female idiopathic subglottic stenosis patients, possibly indicating a role in inappropriate inflammation and increased stenosis susceptibility in these patients [26].",

The inherent disadvantage of a T-tube is the need for a tracheostomy as compared to a dedicated endoluminal stent. It also requires patient compliance with pulmonary hygiene measures including but not limited to saline nebulization, deep breathing exercises  and  self-suctioning.  It  thus  can  significantly  compromise  the quality of life. In our opinion, T -tubes should be reserved for patients who are not surgical candidates for  open resection and endoluminal stent placement that is associated with recurrent stent-related complications.",

For patients with a complex stenosis with a  long  segment  lesion  ( > 1  cm)  or  associated  cartilage  involvement, surgical resection of the involved airway segment is the preferred modality and should be offered before any endoscopic attempts. In fact, some endoscopic procedures (i.e. stenting) may lengthen the extent of the  narrow  segment  potentially  precluding  a  curative-intent  surgical resection [56].",
          "f placement via flexible bronchoscopy, the US Food and Drug Administration has recommended against the use of SEMS for benign airway stenosis due to excessive granulation formation, airway injury and stent fracture [10,61]. Silicone stents, however, may be used for long-term palliation in non-surgical candidates [54,60,62 -64]. Silicone stenting in patients with benign tracheal stenosis does not have to be a life-long intervention. Some patients may be become operable in which case the stent will be removed allowing for tracheal healing and then proceeding with surgical resection. In addition in some patients tracheal remodeling can occur after long term indwelling stenting and the stent could be removed without the need for further intervention. For example, in a large study by Dumon et al., 263 patients underwent 419 silicone stent placements for tracheal stenosis [64]. Of the 117 patients in whom the stent was removed, no recurrence was noted in 64 (25% of all cases). Overall  complications  included  migration  (9.5%),  granuloma  (7.9%) and obstruction by secretions (3.6%) justifying the practice of routine surveillance bronchoscopy. Similarly, in another 2 studies where 47 and 55  patients  underwent  stent  placement  for  PITS,  successful  stent removal  was  possible  in  47%  (22/47)  and  40%  (22/55)  patients, respectively, without need for further interventions [54,62].",

In patients with bronchial stenosis with connective tissue  disorders  such  as  GPA,  pharmacologic  therapy  remains  the mainstay of treatment. Endoscopic interventions with LAMD or electrocautery assisted mechanical dilation may be used in refractory patients  with  clinical  symptoms  (Fig.  5B).

In fact, only  56 -60%  of  the  patients  may  be  ANCA  positive  at  the  time  of diagnosis or relapse of SGS related to GPA [18,19]. Serologic testing, however, should be performed in all patients with SGS, as there is about 1  in  4  chance  of  identifying  an  underlying  connective  tissue  disease (CTD). In  a  study  of  92  patients  with  non-traumatic  LTS,  75%  were found to be idiopathic LTS, but 25% were due to autoimmune disease. In fact, this study showed that ANCA antibodies were only positive in patients with GPA with all other serological testing being equivocal between the two cohorts [20]. The histopathologic assessment in SGS often demonstrates  nonspecific  fibrosis  and  infiltration  by  neutrophils  and epithelioid histiocytes and rarely shows overt vasculitis or granulomatous disease [17 -19]. SGS can also be seen with other CTDs, such as Relapsing Polychondritis (RP). In a large case series of patients with RP, SGS was noted in 5.5% (8/145) of patients [21]. This is often associated with malacia extending to trachea and mainstem bronchi. Other possible etiologies of SGS are listed in Table 2. Despite a thorough work up, in cases when no etiology is identified, a diagnosis of iSGS is established [22 -24]. Idiopathic SGS is primarily seen in females, often in the 5th decade of life [25]. GERD can be seen in up to 65% of the patients with iSGS. There is some evidence demonstrating an imbalance between estrogen  receptor-alpha,  estrogen  receptor-beta,  and  progesterone  receptors in surgical specimens from female idiopathic subglottic stenosis patients, possibly indicating a role in inappropriate inflammation and increased stenosis susceptibility in these patients [26].",

Silicone stenting in patients with benign tracheal stenosis does not have to be a life-long intervention. Some patients may be become operable in which case the stent will be removed allowing for tracheal healing and then proceeding with surgical resection. In addition in some patients tracheal remodeling can occur after long term indwelling stenting and the stent could be removed without the need for further intervention. For example, in a large study by Dumon et al., 263 patients underwent 419 silicone stent placements for tracheal stenosis [64]. Of the 117 patients in whom the stent was removed, no recurrence was noted in 64 (25% of all cases).

In  a  study  of  92  patients  with  non-traumatic  LTS,  75%  were found to be idiopathic LTS, but 25% were due to autoimmune disease. In fact, this study showed that ANCA antibodies were only positive in patients with GPA with all other serological testing being equivocal between the two cohorts [20]. The histopathologic assessment in SGS often demonstrates  nonspecific  fibrosis  and  infiltration  by  neutrophils  and epithelioid histiocytes and rarely shows overt vasculitis or granulomatous disease [17 -19]. SGS can also be seen with other CTDs, such as Relapsing Polychondritis (RP). In a large case series of patients with RP, SGS was noted in 5.5% (8/145) of patients [21]. This is often associated with malacia extending to trachea and mainstem bronchi. Other possible etiologies of SGS are listed in Table 2. Despite a thorough work up, in cases when no etiology is identified, a diagnosis of iSGS is established [22 -24]. Idiopathic SGS is primarily seen in females, often in the 5th decade of life [25]. GERD can be seen in up to 65% of the patients with iSGS. There is some evidence demonstrating an imbalance between estrogen  receptor-alpha,  estrogen  receptor-beta,  and  progesterone  receptors in surgical specimens from female idiopathic subglottic stenosis patients, possibly indicating a role in inappropriate inflammation and increased stenosis susceptibility in these patients [26].",

Silicone stenting in patients with benign tracheal stenosis does not have to be a life-long intervention. Some patients may be become operable in which case the stent will be removed allowing for tracheal healing and then proceeding with surgical resection. In addition in some patients tracheal remodeling can occur after long term indwelling stenting and the stent could be removed without the need for further intervention. For example, in a large study by Dumon et al., 263 patients underwent 419 silicone stent placements for tracheal stenosis [64]. Of the 117 patients in whom the stent was removed, no recurrence was noted in 64 (25% of all cases).

Of note, the classic pattern of truncated inspiratory and expiratory limbs is not sensitive and may only be seen when the tracheal diameter is reduced to 6 -8 mm [11] (Fig. 1B). Patients with unilateral bronchial stenosis may present with a biphasic flow-volume loop, but these findings are also not sensitive [12]. Once non-invasive assessment is completed, the next step is to evaluate the extent and severity of the narrowing and its impact on functional status, voice and swallowing. This involves performing a flexible laryngoscopy and/or a white light bronchoscopy. Biopsies could help narrow the differential diagnosis and rule out an underlying malignant process and may help in diagnosing a benign process. Depending on the disease extent, location, etiology and operability, the care of these patients requires the expertise of a multidisciplinary  airway  team.  Endoscopic  options  include  endoscopic resection, endoscopic dilation, intralesional injection of drugs, endoluminal stents and Montgomery T-tubes. Open surgical options include a chronic indwelling tracheostomy, cricotracheal/laryngotracheal resection with primary anastomosis reconstruction.

In fact, only  56 -60%  of  the  patients  may  be  ANCA  positive  at  the  time  of diagnosis or relapse of SGS related to GPA [18,19]. Serologic testing, however, should be performed in all patients with SGS, as there is about 1  in  4  chance  of  identifying  an  underlying  connective  tissue  disease (CTD). In  a  study  of  92  patients  with  non-traumatic  LTS,  75%  were found to be idiopathic LTS, but 25% were due to autoimmune disease. In fact, this study showed that ANCA antibodies were only positive in patients with GPA with all other serological testing being equivocal between the two cohorts [20]. The histopathologic assessment in SGS often demonstrates  nonspecific  fibrosis  and  infiltration  by  neutrophils  and epithelioid histiocytes and rarely shows overt vasculitis or granulomatous disease [17 -19]. SGS can also be seen with other CTDs, such as Relapsing Polychondritis (RP). In a large case series of patients with RP, SGS was noted in 5.5% (8/145) of patients [21]. This is often associated with malacia extending to trachea and mainstem bronchi. Other possible etiologies of SGS are listed in Table 2. Despite a thorough work up, in cases when no etiology is identified, a diagnosis of iSGS is established [22 -24]. Idiopathic SGS is primarily seen in females, often in the 5th decade of life [25]. GERD can be seen in up to 65% of the patients with iSGS. There is some evidence demonstrating an imbalance between estrogen  receptor-alpha,  estrogen  receptor-beta,  and  progesterone  receptors in surgical specimens from female idiopathic subglottic stenosis patients, possibly indicating a role in inappropriate inflammation and increased stenosis susceptibility in these patients [26].",

Silicone stents, however, may be used for long-term palliation in non-surgical candidates [54,60,62 -64]. Silicone stenting in patients with benign tracheal stenosis does not have to be a life-long intervention. Some patients may be become operable in which case the stent will be removed allowing for tracheal healing and then proceeding with surgical resection. In addition in some patients tracheal remodeling can occur after long term indwelling stenting and the stent could be removed without the need for further intervention. For example, in a large study by Dumon et al., 263 patients underwent 419 silicone stent placements for tracheal stenosis [64]. Of the 117 patients in whom the stent was removed, no recurrence was noted in 64 (25% of all cases). Overall  complications  included  migration  (9.5%),  granuloma  (7.9%) and obstruction by secretions (3.6%) justifying the practice of routine surveillance bronchoscopy.

Pulmonary  function testing with attention to the flow volume loops can help detect patterns of airflow obstruction and allow monitoring physiologic changes after interventions. Of note, the classic pattern of truncated inspiratory and expiratory limbs is not sensitive and may only be seen when the tracheal diameter is reduced to 6 -8 mm [11] (Fig. 1B). Patients with unilateral bronchial stenosis may present with a biphasic flow-volume loop, but these findings are also not sensitive [12]. Once non-invasive assessment is completed, the next step is to evaluate the extent and severity of the narrowing and its impact on functional status, voice and swallowing. This involves performing a flexible laryngoscopy and/or a white light bronchoscopy. Biopsies could help narrow the differential diagnosis and rule out an underlying malignant process and may help in diagnosing a benign process. Depending on the disease extent, location, etiology and operability, the care of these patients requires the expertise of a multidisciplinary  airway  team.  Endoscopic  options  include  endoscopic resection, endoscopic dilation, intralesional injection of drugs, endoluminal stents and Montgomery T-tubes. Open surgical options include a chronic indwelling tracheostomy, cricotracheal/laryngotracheal resection with primary anastomosis reconstruction. Given the multitude of techniques learned through different training pathways, major academic centers have implemented such teams for management of patients with benign airway strictures. In this article we propose a multi-disciplinary algorithmic  approach  for  the  management  of  patients  with  benign airway strictures based on currently published evidence and available local expertise [Fig. 2]."

Serologic testing, however, should be performed in all patients with SGS, as there is about 1  in  4  chance  of  identifying  an  underlying  connective  tissue  disease (CTD). In  a  study  of  92  patients  with  non-traumatic  LTS,  75%  were found to be idiopathic LTS, but 25% were due to autoimmune disease. In fact, this study showed that ANCA antibodies were only positive in patients with GPA with all other serological testing being equivocal between the two cohorts [20]. The histopathologic assessment in SGS often demonstrates  nonspecific  fibrosis  and  infiltration  by  neutrophils  and epithelioid histiocytes and rarely shows overt vasculitis or granulomatous disease [17 -19]. SGS can also be seen with other CTDs, such as Relapsing Polychondritis (RP). In a large case series of patients with RP, SGS was noted in 5.5% (8/145) of patients [21]. This is often associated with malacia extending to trachea and mainstem bronchi. Other possible etiologies of SGS are listed in Table 2. Despite a thorough work up, in cases when no etiology is identified, a diagnosis of iSGS is established [22 -24]. Idiopathic SGS is primarily seen in females, often in the 5th decade of life [25]. GERD can be seen in up to 65% of the patients with iSGS. There is some evidence demonstrating an imbalance between estrogen  receptor-alpha,  estrogen  receptor-beta,  and  progesterone  receptors in surgical specimens from female idiopathic subglottic stenosis patients, possibly indicating a role in inappropriate inflammation and increased stenosis susceptibility in these patients [26].",

Silicone stenting in patients with benign tracheal stenosis does not have to be a life-long intervention. Some patients may be become operable in which case the stent will be removed allowing for tracheal healing and then proceeding with surgical resection. In addition in some patients tracheal remodeling can occur after long term indwelling stenting and the stent could be removed without the need for further intervention. For example, in a large study by Dumon et al., 263 patients underwent 419 silicone stent placements for tracheal stenosis [64]. Of the 117 patients in whom the stent was removed, no recurrence was noted in 64 (25% of all cases).

Of note, the classic pattern of truncated inspiratory and expiratory limbs is not sensitive and may only be seen when the tracheal diameter is reduced to 6 -8 mm [11] (Fig. 1B). Patients with unilateral bronchial stenosis may present with a biphasic flow-volume loop, but these findings are also not sensitive [12]. Once non-invasive assessment is completed, the next step is to evaluate the extent and severity of the narrowing and its impact on functional status, voice and swallowing. This involves performing a flexible laryngoscopy and/or a white light bronchoscopy. Biopsies could help narrow the differential diagnosis and rule out an underlying malignant process and may help in diagnosing a benign process. Depending on the disease extent, location, etiology and operability, the care of these patients requires the expertise of a multidisciplinary  airway  team.  Endoscopic  options  include  endoscopic resection, endoscopic dilation, intralesional injection of drugs, endoluminal stents and Montgomery T-tubes. Open surgical options include a chronic indwelling tracheostomy, cricotracheal/laryngotracheal resection with primary anastomosis reconstruction. Given the multitude of techniques learned through different training pathways, major academic centers have implemented such teams for management of patients with benign airway strictures. In this article we propose a multi-disciplinary algorithmic  approach  for  the  management  of  patients  with  benign airway strictures based on currently published evidence and available local expertise [Fig. 2]."

Silicone stenting in patients with benign tracheal stenosis does not have to be a life-long intervention. Some patients may be become operable in which case the stent will be removed allowing for tracheal healing and then proceeding with surgical resection. In addition in some patients tracheal remodeling can occur after long term indwelling stenting and the stent could be removed without the need for further intervention. For example, in a large study by Dumon et al., 263 patients underwent 419 silicone stent placements for tracheal stenosis [64]. Of the 117 patients in whom the stent was removed, no recurrence was noted in 64 (25% of all cases).

Of note, the classic pattern of truncated inspiratory and expiratory limbs is not sensitive and may only be seen when the tracheal diameter is reduced to 6 -8 mm [11] (Fig. 1B). Patients with unilateral bronchial stenosis may present with a biphasic flow-volume loop, but these findings are also not sensitive [12]. Once non-invasive assessment is completed, the next step is to evaluate the extent and severity of the narrowing and its impact on functional status, voice and swallowing. This involves performing a flexible laryngoscopy and/or a white light bronchoscopy. Biopsies could help narrow the differential diagnosis and rule out an underlying malignant process and may help in diagnosing a benign process. Depending on the disease extent, location, etiology and operability, the care of these patients requires the expertise of a multidisciplinary  airway  team.  Endoscopic  options  include  endoscopic resection, endoscopic dilation, intralesional injection of drugs, endoluminal stents and Montgomery T-tubes. Open surgical options include a chronic indwelling tracheostomy, cricotracheal/laryngotracheal resection with primary anastomosis reconstruction. Given the multitude of techniques learned through different training pathways, major academic centers have implemented such teams for management of patients with benign airway strictures.

Patients with unilateral bronchial stenosis may present with a biphasic flow-volume loop, but these findings are also not sensitive [12]. Once non-invasive assessment is completed, the next step is to evaluate the extent and severity of the narrowing and its impact on functional status, voice and swallowing. This involves performing a flexible laryngoscopy and/or a white light bronchoscopy. Biopsies could help narrow the differential diagnosis and rule out an underlying malignant process and may help in diagnosing a benign process. Depending on the disease extent, location, etiology and operability, the care of these patients requires the expertise of a multidisciplinary  airway  team.  Endoscopic  options  include  endoscopic resection, endoscopic dilation, intralesional injection of drugs, endoluminal stents and Montgomery T-tubes. Open surgical options include a chronic indwelling tracheostomy, cricotracheal/laryngotracheal resection with primary anastomosis reconstruction. Given the multitude of techniques learned through different training pathways, major academic centers have implemented such teams for management of patients with benign airway strictures.

In addition in some patients tracheal remodeling can occur after long term indwelling stenting and the stent could be removed without the need for further intervention. For example, in a large study by Dumon et al., 263 patients underwent 419 silicone stent placements for tracheal stenosis [64]. Of the 117 patients in whom the stent was removed, no recurrence was noted in 64 (25% of all cases).

Of note, the classic pattern of truncated inspiratory and expiratory limbs is not sensitive and may only be seen when the tracheal diameter is reduced to 6 -8 mm [11] (Fig. 1B). Patients with unilateral bronchial stenosis may present with a biphasic flow-volume loop, but these findings are also not sensitive [12]. Once non-invasive assessment is completed, the next step is to evaluate the extent and severity of the narrowing and its impact on functional status, voice and swallowing. This involves performing a flexible laryngoscopy and/or a white light bronchoscopy. Biopsies could help narrow the differential diagnosis and rule out an underlying malignant process and may help in diagnosing a benign process. Depending on the disease extent, location, etiology and operability, the care of these patients requires the expertise of a multidisciplinary  airway  team.  Endoscopic  options  include  endoscopic resection, endoscopic dilation, intralesional injection of drugs, endoluminal stents and Montgomery T-tubes. Open surgical options include a chronic indwelling tracheostomy, cricotracheal/laryngotracheal resection with primary anastomosis reconstruction. Given the multitude of techniques learned through different training pathways, major academic centers have implemented such teams for management of patients with benign airway strictures. In this article we propose a multi-disciplinary algorithmic  approach  for  the  management  of  patients  with  benign airway strictures based on currently published evidence and available local expertise [Fig. 2]."

Patients with unilateral bronchial stenosis may present with a biphasic flow-volume loop, but these findings are also not sensitive [12]. Once non-invasive assessment is completed, the next step is to evaluate the extent and severity of the narrowing and its impact on functional status, voice and swallowing. This involves performing a flexible laryngoscopy and/or a white light bronchoscopy. Biopsies could help narrow the differential diagnosis and rule out an underlying malignant process and may help in diagnosing a benign process. Depending on the disease extent, location, etiology and operability, the care of these patients requires the expertise of a multidisciplinary  airway  team.  Endoscopic  options  include  endoscopic resection, endoscopic dilation, intralesional injection of drugs, endoluminal stents and Montgomery T-tubes. Open surgical options include a chronic indwelling tracheostomy, cricotracheal/laryngotracheal resection with primary anastomosis reconstruction. Given the multitude of techniques learned through different training pathways, major academic centers have implemented such teams for management of patients with benign airway strictures.

          ") as well as serological tests for working up potential underlying  connective  tissue  disorders  (CTD).  Pulmonary  function testing with attention to the flow volume loops can help detect patterns of airflow obstruction and allow monitoring physiologic changes after interventions. Of note, the classic pattern of truncated inspiratory and expiratory limbs is not sensitive and may only be seen when the tracheal diameter is reduced to 6 -8 mm [11] (Fig. 1B). Patients with unilateral bronchial stenosis may present with a biphasic flow-volume loop, but these findings are also not sensitive [12]. Once non-invasive assessment is completed, the next step is to evaluate the extent and severity of the narrowing and its impact on functional status, voice and swallowing. This involves performing a flexible laryngoscopy and/or a white light bronchoscopy. Biopsies could help narrow the differential diagnosis and rule out an underlying malignant process and may help in diagnosing a benign process. Depending on the disease extent, location, etiology and operability, the care of these patients requires the expertise of a multidisciplinary  airway  team.  Endoscopic  options  include  endoscopic resection, endoscopic dilation, intralesional injection of drugs, endoluminal stents and Montgomery T-tubes. Open surgical options include a chronic indwelling tracheostomy, cricotracheal/laryngotracheal resection with primary anastomosis reconstruction. Given the multitude of techniques learned through different training pathways, major academic centers have implemented such teams for management of patients with benign airway strictures. In this article we propose a multi-disciplinary algorithmic  approach  for  the  management  of  patients  with  benign airway strictures based on currently published evidence and available local expertise [Fig. 2]."

Moderate stenosis (51 -70% reduction in CSA) could  cause  symptoms  on  exertion  with  a  significant  pressure  drop occurring at higher flow rates. Severe stenosis ( > 71% reduction in CSA) results in significant pressure gradient even at a low flow rates leading to symptoms at rest or mild exertion. Objective quantification of the degree of narrowing determines whether a certain airway stricture contributes to patient ' s dyspnea. There are other symptoms, however, that impact the decision-making process pertinent to treatment. Patients with laryngotracheal stenosis (LTS) can have symptoms other than dyspnea such as dysphagia and dysphonia. In fact, some classification systems address",

Table 1 summarizes and describes the pros and cons of each of the published classification systems [2 -8]. While the ideal system in the classification of LTS remains questionable, a recent study assessed three classification systems to effectively stratify the risk of long term tracheostomy and demonstrated that the McCaffrey and Lano systems offer more precision than the Cotton-Myer scale [9]. We believe that regardless of which classification system one uses, a proper documentation  of  laryngeal  or  tracheal  stenosis  should  be  based  on  objective criteria and include: assessment of functional impairment (eg. Dyspnea scales,  performance  status);  length  of  the  stenotic  airway;  shape (circumferential, elliptical, crescent or triangular), complexity (with or without malacia) and precise location (centimeters or number of rings below  or  above  a  specific  reference  point-vocal  cords,  cricoid,  main carina for laryngotracheal strictures or main carina, primary and secondary carinas for bronchial strictures) [10].",

          "ourse [17], a negative ANCA does not permit exclusion of GPA. In fact, only  56 -60%  of  the  patients  may  be  ANCA  positive  at  the  time  of diagnosis or relapse of SGS related to GPA [18,19]. Serologic testing, however, should be performed in all patients with SGS, as there is about 1  in  4  chance  of  identifying  an  underlying  connective  tissue  disease (CTD). In  a  study  of  92  patients  with  non-traumatic  LTS,  75%  were found to be idiopathic LTS, but 25% were due to autoimmune disease. In fact, this study showed that ANCA antibodies were only positive in patients with GPA with all other serological testing being equivocal between the two cohorts [20]. The histopathologic assessment in SGS often demonstrates  nonspecific  fibrosis  and  infiltration  by  neutrophils  and epithelioid histiocytes and rarely shows overt vasculitis or granulomatous disease [17 -19]. SGS can also be seen with other CTDs, such as Relapsing Polychondritis (RP). In a large case series of patients with RP, SGS was noted in 5.5% (8/145) of patients [21]. This is often associated with malacia extending to trachea and mainstem bronchi. Other possible etiologies of SGS are listed in Table 2. Despite a thorough work up, in cases when no etiology is identified, a diagnosis of iSGS is established [22 -24]. Idiopathic SGS is primarily seen in females, often in the 5th decade of life [25]. GERD can be seen in up to 65% of the patients with iSGS. There is some evidence demonstrating an imbalance between estrogen  receptor-alpha,  estrogen  receptor-beta,  and  progesterone  receptors in surgical specimens from female idiopathic subglottic stenosis patients, possibly indicating a role in inappropriate inflammation and increased stenosis susceptibility in these patients [26].",

The inherent disadvantage of a T-tube is the need for a tracheostomy as compared to a dedicated endoluminal stent. It also requires patient compliance with pulmonary hygiene measures including but not limited to saline nebulization, deep breathing exercises  and  self-suctioning.  It  thus  can  significantly  compromise  the quality of life. In our opinion, T -tubes should be reserved for patients who are not surgical candidates for  open resection and endoluminal stent placement that is associated with recurrent stent-related complications.",

For patients with a complex stenosis with a  long  segment  lesion  ( > 1  cm)  or  associated  cartilage  involvement, surgical resection of the involved airway segment is the preferred modality and should be offered before any endoscopic attempts. In fact, some endoscopic procedures (i.e. stenting) may lengthen the extent of the  narrow  segment  potentially  precluding  a  curative-intent  surgical resection [56].",
          "f placement via flexible bronchoscopy, the US Food and Drug Administration has recommended against the use of SEMS for benign airway stenosis due to excessive granulation formation, airway injury and stent fracture [10,61]. Silicone stents, however, may be used for long-term palliation in non-surgical candidates [54,60,62 -64]. Silicone stenting in patients with benign tracheal stenosis does not have to be a life-long intervention. Some patients may be become operable in which case the stent will be removed allowing for tracheal healing and then proceeding with surgical resection. In addition in some patients tracheal remodeling can occur after long term indwelling stenting and the stent could be removed without the need for further intervention. For example, in a large study by Dumon et al., 263 patients underwent 419 silicone stent placements for tracheal stenosis [64]. Of the 117 patients in whom the stent was removed, no recurrence was noted in 64 (25% of all cases). Overall  complications  included  migration  (9.5%),  granuloma  (7.9%) and obstruction by secretions (3.6%) justifying the practice of routine surveillance bronchoscopy. Similarly, in another 2 studies where 47 and 55  patients  underwent  stent  placement  for  PITS,  successful  stent removal  was  possible  in  47%  (22/47)  and  40%  (22/55)  patients, respectively, without need for further interventions [54,62].",
