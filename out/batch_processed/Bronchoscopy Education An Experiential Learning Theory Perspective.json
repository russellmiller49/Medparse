    "abstract": "The application of ELM to bronchoscopy training is learner centered and faculty intense. Bronchoscopy programs implementing ELM set up workshops to build and enhance their technical skills using low-fidelity and high-fidelity simulators or cadaveric-based models. The curriculum design provides access to slide presentations, multiple choice questions, and interactive didactic learning material to improve cognitive learning, whereas simulation sessions focus on mastery of technical Recommended number of procedures for American Association for Bronchology and Interventional Pulmonology interventional pulmonology fellowship accreditation skills, thus providing a comprehensive learning experience. PBLs help improve critical decision making and communication. Together, these modalities contribute to active engagement, which in turn leads to durable learning. All methods described herein, including interactive questionand-answer sessions, PBLs, and simulation, are teaching modalities preferred by learners. They require not only content experts but also trained faculty dedicated to learner-centered teaching. Faculty development programs are thus an essential component for genuine bronchoscopy education. WABIP and CHEST are among the organizations that have led initiatives to help bronchoscopy educators gain in-depth familiarity with curriculum design and meet adequate standards to better train health care professionals who seek to improve their bronchoscopy skills",

Traditional lectures have minimal active audience participation, and usually educators are inclined to simply review data rather than truly educate. Lectures may thus be perceived as overwhelming and may burden the learners with excessive information. For any type of substantial learning to occur, more interactive teaching methods must be used."

The key to meaningful education is the understanding of how learning occurs in an individual. Incorporating varied learning styles in an educational encounter seems the most desirable way of approaching teaching programs. 1 This method has the potential to influence individual learning as well as the core components of medical education, from individual lectures or hands-on activities to entire courses. 1"

His model encourages incorporating learning formats that are conducive to most learners. 5 Importantly, learners' preferred styles may differ, but that should not matter because this model's implementation incorporates all learning styles. 1 A truly effective educational model facilitates an individual's ability to harness knowledge by incorporating different learning styles into the curriculum."

For instance, during a bronchoscopy course at the CHEST headquarters in Chicago, Illinois, a survey showed that a majority of learners (90%) preferred to experiment with newly acquired information; their learning style was congruent with Kolb's third and fourth quadrants.

This style promotes reflection on the content presented, allowing time for a learner's engagement with the faculty. The interaction, however, is dependent on a learner's personal understanding of the material. If a lecture style is necessary for addressing this learning style, it is paramount that the lecture material is engaging. Use of bullet points, concise slides, and regular audience participation via ARSs can keep participants interested. 6 Presenting information in a quiz format improves retention, likely because of the effort put into the learning process. 7 This style can be incorporated into lectures by using ARS participation.

Learners can build on existing knowledge by incorporating new evidence and applying theory into practice. 1,8 Experimentation and risk-taking in a safe and controlled environment allows physicians to expand their armamentarium.

Simulation laboratories mimic real-life scenarios to test newly acquired skills. Participants can analyze the impact of new knowledge and skills and evaluate the results.

Learners can intuitively attempt integration of new concepts into their current practice. This concept has gained traction with the advent of Web-based technologies that offer massive open online courses, enabling learners to gain access to lecture material via online portals.

Since then, this model has been tried and tested with other demographics and is gaining acceptance with undergraduate and graduate learning programs as well as several medical schools. 11-13 It provides an opportunity for learners to review the lecture material online in Portable Document Format (PDF), slide format, or multimedia presentations prior to meeting in the actual classroom. Interactive techniques have been shown to improve retention of knowledge in health care employees and have increased participant satisfaction. 14-16 This is a dynamic learning model where traditional lectures can be provided to students online for reading at leisure, leaving actual student-teacher interaction for engaging in PBL and critical analysis of the lecture content. 17 The flipped classroom model increases active learning for the student compared with traditional classroom-based instruction. 13 Improved test scores have been observed in graduate students along with increased class attendance. 11,13 In the flipped classroom model, transmission of facts is performed by reviewing the learning material outside of the classroom setting, usually in the form of articles (less preferred), slide presentations, voice-over lectures, videos, or even augmented reality platforms (most preferred).

This generation witnessed the dawn of technological advancement impact on their traditional homes and society. 6 They prefer learning styles where learners are collective participants for faculty to address and thus are more accustomed to lecture-based learning (ie, quadrants 1 and 2). 6 Generally, they adapt well to teaching habits that tailor personal growth and development. 25 They find it difficult to adjust to instant learning, however, because of unfamiliarity with activity-based learning.

The aim is to encourage teamwork for the diagnosis and management of a certain clinical problem. For example, newly diagnosed lung cancer requires input and feedback from different team members, with each contributing to a specific aspect of patient care. Some of the areas that may be discussed in this scenario include diagnostic interventions, staging of the disease, specimen acquisition, and handling and processing for cytology, histology, and molecular testing.

There are different modes of feedback. Continuous feedback is used each time a student performs a task, whereas differential feedback is offered each time a learner performs better. One advantage of differential feedback is the emphasis on improvement, thereby giving learners an opportunity for recognizing their accomplishments. Immediate feedback is a potent tool for change. 32 This was demonstrated to have a positive impact on performance in surgical clerkship students. 33 Regardless of the method, providing honest feedback is essential for meaningful education. Dishonest, positive feedback can be detrimental to learners because praise, self-esteem, and performance rise and fall together. 34"

There is a false perception of individual performance and the inability to recognize one's own shortcomings. While working in a group setting, low-percentile performers overestimate their performance, and high-percentile performers underestimate their performance. This enhancement of the self gives the learner a false sense of accomplishment. 35 In the authors' opinion, this is a common phenomenon among participants at bronchoscopy courses and is supported by published evidence. 36 The overinflated illusion of self-grandeur limits critical thinking and mastery of a skill. This eventually can affect patient care. Procedural complications are often a result of this phenomenon. An example of this can be seen with endobronchial ultrasound (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS))related complications involving hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes biopsies with resultant intramural hematoma and hemomediastinum. 37"

The troubling pattern with poor judgment is that individuals seldom recognize their ineptitude despite the execution of flawed actions and poor outcomes. 38 Because learners lack the tools to estimate their own skills, it is critical for educators to provide constructive and corrective feedback. Lack of negative feedback can lead to failure to understand why errors happen and thereby limit implementation of corrective measures. Negative feedback should, however, be considered only in a manner that brings meaningful results. 38"

Knowledge bias is a faculty trap where an educator's selfknowledge leads to believing the same of the learner. 39 It is the implicit failure of recognition of faculty's own skills leading to the projection of the bias on the learner. The curse of expertise (also known as the curse of knowledge) is a miscalibration or inability to recognize what tools may be required for a learner to learn a task or master a skill. 40 One way to curb this bias is for instructors to systematically follow checklists, such as the one shown in Fig. 3 , while teaching procedural skills. This ensures that learners are cognizant of all the involved steps needed for mastery of a procedural task.",

It has become evident over the years that bronchoscopy skills vary among individuals based on prior access to simulation laboratories, training environment, and logistics. Because physician competency has an impact on safety and patient care, training programs are challenged to incorporate simulation-based training and objective measurement of procedural skills. The eventual goal is to standardize bronchoscopy training and assess competency through gained cognitive and technical skills, not on numbers of procedures performed. For training programs to better monitor effectiveness of their curricula, the performance status of their trainees must be tracked. This can be done for fundamental bronchoscopy (ie, BSTAT), Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-Transbronchial Needle Aspiration (ie, Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-STAT), and even for rigid bronchoscopy.

        "abstract": "As changes in health care delivery systems and in the global burden of disease call for a reassessment of how tomorrow's physicians should be educated--indeed, for a reconsideration of the diversity of roles the physician should play--there is an immediate need to produce continuing medical education (CME) programs with real impact. Curriculum planners are questioning both the content of medical education and the methods of instruction and training. The product, or content, and the mechanism for its delivery have been defined and discussed, but a significant body of literature has shown that new knowledge does not necessarily lead to new behavior. Ample evidence exists in the CME literature to support the implementation of more active and self-directed learning strategies to promote the desired change in behaviors. The question, then, that is the focus of this article is how educational planning might be better guided by an understanding of how physicians learn within the continuing medical education domain. Revisiting the principles of David Kolb's Learning Styles Inventory, the authors propose applying his experiential learning model to overall curriculum design work. The authors argue that promoting the application of all learning styles in sequence in an educational encounter is a most desirable approach, and that this approach to learning could extend far beyond individual learners to influence how every component of medical education is designed, from the individual lecture or class activity to entire courses or programs."

        "abstract": "To test the hypothesis that lecturing maximizes learning and course performance, we metaanalyzed 225 studies that reported data on examination scores or failure rates when comparing student performance in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses under traditional lecturing versus active learning. The effect sizes indicate that on average, student performance on examinations and concept inventories increased by 0.47 SDs under active learning (n = 158 studies), and that the odds ratio for failing was 1.95 under traditional lecturing (n = 67 studies). These results indicate that average examination scores improved by about 6% in active learning sections, and that students in classes with traditional lecturing were 1.5 times more likely to fail than were students in classes with active learning. Heterogeneity analyses indicated that both results hold across the STEM disciplines, that active learning increases scores on concept inventories more than on course examinations, and that active learning appears effective across all class sizes--although the greatest effects are in small (n &#x2264; 50) classes. Trim and fill analyses and fail-safe n calculations suggest that the results are not due to publication bias. The results also appear robust to variation in the methodological rigor of the included studies, based on the quality of controls over student quality and instructor identity. This is the largest and most comprehensive metaanalysis of undergraduate STEM education published to date. The results raise questions about the continued use of traditional lecturing as a control in research studies, and support active learning as the preferred, empirically validated teaching practice in regular classrooms."

Over the course of 3 years (2010-2013), the authors facilitated more than 80 implementations of games and virtual patient simulations into the education of 550 osteopathic medical students. The authors report on 4 key aspects of the TEAL-MEd initiative, including purpose, portfolio of tools, progress to date regarding challenges and solutions, and future directions. Lessons learned may be of benefit to medical educators at academic and clinical training sites who wish to implement TEAL-MEd activities."

The data suggest that the optimum length of a lecture may be 30 instead of 60 min. This method by which student feedback is obtained may also be used to improve lecturing performance."

Therefore, continuing pharmacy education (CPE) could be utilized as a valuable modality to upgrade pharmacists' capabilities. A randomized controlled trial was designed to compare the efficacy of CPE meetings (lecture based vs. workshop based) on contraception and male sexual dysfunctions. Sixty pharmacists were recruited for each CPE meeting. Small group training using simulated patients was employed in the workshop-based CPE. Study outcomes were declarative/procedural knowledge, attitudes, and satisfaction of the participants. Data were collected pre-CPE, post-CPE, and 2 months afterward and were analyzed using repeated measure analysis of variance and Mann-Whitney U test. Results showed that lecture-based CPE was more successful in improving pharmacists' knowledge post-CPE (p &lt; .001). In contrast, a significant decrease was observed in the lecture-based group at follow-up (p = .002), whereas the workshop-based group maintained their knowledge over time (p = 1.00). Knowledge scores of both groups were significantly higher at follow-up in comparison with pre-CPE (p &lt; .01). No significant differences were observed regarding satisfaction and attitudes scores between groups. In conclusion, an interactive workshop might not be superior to lecture-based training for improving pharmacists' knowledge and attitudes in a 1-day CPE meeting."

        "abstract": "Recent reform of medical education highlights the growing concerns about the capability of the current educational model to equip medical school students with essential skills for future career development. In the field of ophthalmology, although many attempts have been made to address the problem of the decreasing teaching time and the increasing load of course content, a growing body of literature indicates the need to reform the current ophthalmology teaching strategies. Flipped classroom is a new pedagogical model in which students develop a basic understanding of the course materials before class, and use in-class time for learner-centered activities, such as group discussion and presentation. However, few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of the flipped classroom in ophthalmology education. This study, for the first time, assesses the use of flipped classroom in ophthalmology, specifically glaucoma and ocular trauma clerkship teaching. A total number of 44 international medical school students from diverse background were enrolled in this study, and randomly divided into two groups. One group took the flipped glaucoma classroom and lecture-based ocular trauma classroom, while the other group took the flipped ocular trauma classroom and lecture-based glaucoma classroom. In the traditional lecture-based classroom, students attended the didactic lecture and did the homework after class. In the flipped classroom, students were asked to watch the prerecorded lectures before the class, and use the class time for homework discussion. Both the teachers and students were asked to complete feedback questionnaires after the classroom. We found that the two groups did not show differences in the final exam scores. However, the flipped classroom helped students to develop skills in problem solving, creative thinking and team working. Also, compared to the lecture-based classroom, both teachers and students were more satisfied with the flipped classroom. Interestingly, students had a more positive attitude towards the flipped ocular trauma classroom than the flipped glaucoma classroom regarding the teaching process, the course materials, and the value of the classroom. Therefore, the flipped classroom model in ophthalmology teaching showed promise as an effective approach to promote active learning."

Low- and high-fidelity simulators are now available and allow learners to gain fundamental bronchoscopy skills in a zero-risk environment. Testing trainees on simulators is currently possible by using validated assessment tools for both essential bronchoscopy and endobronchial ultrasound skills, and more tools are under development for other bronchoscopic techniques. Educational concepts including the 'flipped classroom' model and problem-based learning exercises are increasingly used in bronchoscopy training programmes. These learner-centric teaching modalities require well-trained educators, which is possible thorough the expansion of existing faculty development programmes."

We trialed the flipped classroom in our fourth-year student clerkship. Our aim was to learn student and faculty facilitator perceptions of the experience, as it has not been done previously in this setting. We evaluated this in two ways: (1) participant perception of the experience and (2) facilitator (EM physician educator) perception of student preparation, participation, and knowledge synthesis."

This way of accounting for the time spent in training has two essential parts, classroom teaching (work with the professor) and distance learning (work without the professor, whether in an individual or collective way). Much has been published on the distance learning part, but less on the classroom teaching section. In this work, the authors investigate didactic strategies and associated aids for distance learning work in a concept based on flipped classroom where transmitting information is carried out with aids that the professor prepares, so that the student works in an independent way before the classes, thus being able to dedicate the classroom teaching time to more complex learning and being able to count on the professor's help."

Managed care presents an immediate and challenging opportunity to providers of continuing medical education to offer effective educational programs for physicians on managed care issues. In this exploratory research, the problem-based learning model was used to develop a continuing medical education program that would offer an interactive and effective method for teaching physicians about managed care. Problem-based learning is a departure from the traditional lecture format of continuing medical education programs because it is designed for small groups of self-directed learners who are guided by a faculty facilitator. Although only a small number of participants participated in this program, the findings offer important considerations for providers of continuing medical education. For example, participants reported increased confidence in their knowledge about managed care issues. Participants also clearly indicated a preference for the small group, interactive format of the problem-based learning model."

We sought out to objectively identify potential areas of improvement through direct feedback and implement programmatic changes to address these areas.

The test group comprised 50 medical students who underwent a standard 4-minute examination followed by 2 minutes of feedback. Immediately following feedback the students repeated an identical 4-minute examination scored by the same examiners. The control group consisted of 50 students from the same class who underwent an identical testing sequence, but instead of receiving feedback, they were instructed to continue their examinations for an additional 2 minutes before repeating the stations. Simple repetition of the task did not significantly improve score (mean increase 2.0%, NS). Extending the testing period from 4 to 6 minutes resulted in a small but significant increase in score (mean 6.7%, P less than 0.001). However, there was a much larger increase in the scores obtained following 2 minutes of immediate feedback compared to pre-feedback performance (mean 26.3%, P less than 0.0001). The majority of students and examiners felt that feedback, as administered in this study, was valuable both as a learning and teaching experience. Short periods of immediate feedback during an OSCE are practical and can improve competency in the performance of criterion-based tasks, at least over the short term. In addition, such feedback provides students with valuable self-assessment that may stimulate further learning."

The authors suggest that this overestimation occurs, in part, because people who are unskilled in these domains suffer a dual burden: Not only do these people reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate choices, but their incompetence robs them of the metacognitive ability to realize it. Across 4 studies, the authors found that participants scoring in the bottom quartile on tests of humor, grammar, and logic grossly overestimated their test performance and ability. Although their test scores put them in the 12th percentile, they estimated themselves to be in the 62nd. Several analyses linked this miscalibration to deficits in metacognitive skill, or the capacity to distinguish accuracy from error. Paradoxically, improving the skills of participants, and thus increasing their metacognitive competence, helped them recognize the limitations of their abilities."

This unskilled and unaware effect has been attributed to poor performers' lack of metacognitive ability to realize their ineptitude. We contend that the unskilled are motivated to ignore (be unaware of) their poor performance so that they can feel better about themselves. We tested this idea in an experiment in which we manipulated the perceived self-relevancy of the task to men and women after they had completed a visual pun task and before they estimated their performance on the task. As predicted, the unskilled and unaware effect was attenuated when the task was perceived to have low self-relevance."

We find that expertise increases confidence in the ability to explain a wide variety of phenomena. However, this confidence is unwarranted; after actually offering full explanations, people are surprised by the limitations in their understanding. For passive expertise (familiar topics), miscalibration is moderated by education; those with more education are accurate in their self-assessments (Experiment 1).&#xa0;But when those with more education consider topics related to their area of concentrated study (college major), they also display an illusion of understanding (Experiment 2). This \"curse of expertise\" is explained by a failure to recognize the amount of detailed information that had been forgotten (Experiment 3). While expertise can sometimes lead to accurate self-knowledge, it can also create illusions of competence."

Previous studies have demonstrated construct validity of these systems and transfer of virtual skills to the operating room. However, to date no simulator-training curricula have been designed and there is very little evidence on the impact of external feedback on acquisition of endoscopic skills. The aim of the present study was to assess the impact of external feedback on the learning curves on a VR colonoscopy simulator using inexperienced trainees."

Anesthesiologists, cardiothoracic and trauma surgeons, otolaryngologists, and critical are physicians also perform this procedure as part of difficult airway management, intubation or airway inspection and bronchial toilet. Compared to the expanding body of simulation-related literature that is available in other procedural fields, however, the volume of published work relating to bronchoscopy is scant. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the available literature pertaining to the use of simulation in bronchoscopy education, and to demonstrate how this limited yet valuable body of work lays a foundation for the future use of simulator-based bronchoscopy training."

A growing armamentarium of diagnostic and therapeutic tools has expanded the interventional pulmonologist's ability to care for pulmonary patients with complex abnormalities, often in concert and close collaboration with physicians in other specialties, such as thoracic surgery. Innovative technologies promise to have an impact on diseases and clinical entities not traditionally treated by invasive pulmonary interventions, such as asthma, COPD, and the solitary pulmonary nodule. Training, credentialing, reimbursement, and scientific validation remain key necessities for the continued growth of IP, and require a concerted effort by chest physicians and their professional organizations."

        "abstract": "Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) is currently the modality of choice for evaluation of mediastinal lymphadenopathy. However, there is still uncertainty regarding the training methodology and the number of procedures required to attain proficiency in EBUS. Herein, we performed a systematic review of studies selected from PubMed, EmBase and Scopus databases describing the training and assessment of proficiency during EBUS, specifically studies investigating various methods for training, its outcome and the number of procedures required to overcome the learning curve for EBUS. Twenty-seven (simulator-based learning (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;8), tools for assessing competence in EBUS-TBNA (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;5) and threshold numbers needed to attain proficiency in EBUS-TBNA (n&#x2009;=&#x2009;16)) studies were identified. An EBUS simulator accurately stratified individuals based on the level of experience in performing EBUS. Training received on a simulator was comparable with traditional apprentice-based training. Importantly, skills acquired on a simulator could be transferred to real-world patients. The number needed to overcome the initial learning curve of EBUS varied from 10 to 100 in individual studies with a mean of 37-44 procedures. Tools such as EBUS-STAT (EBUS skill and task assessment tool) and EBUSAT (EBUS skill and assessment tool) were effective in evaluating the EBUS trainees. We conclude that an EBUS simulator or EBUS assessment tools can objectively assess the training of an EBUS trainee. Simulator-based training is a useful modality in EBUS training. The number of procedures needed to overcome the initial learning curve is about 40. Centres involved in EBUS training could incorporate simulator-based training in their curriculum before allowing operators to perform EBUS on patients."

Virtual reality simulators have been proposed as potential EBUS-TBNA training instruments, to avoid unskilled beginners practicing directly in real-life settings. A validated and perfected simulation program could be used before allowing beginners to practice on patients. Our goal was to test the reliability of the EBUS-Skills and Task Assessment Tool (STAT) and its subscores for measuring the competence of experienced bronchoscopists approaching EBUS-guided TBNA, using only the virtual reality simulator as both a training and an assessment tool."

In the last 10 years, formal IP fellowships have increased substantially in number from five to now &gt; 30. The vast majority of IP fellowship trainees are selected through the National Resident Matching Program, and validated in-service and certification examinations for IP exist. Practice standards and training guidelines for IP fellowship programs have been published; however, considerable variability in the environment, curriculum, and experience offered by the various fellowship programs remains, and there is currently no formal accreditation process in place to standardize IP fellowship training. Recognizing the need for more uniform training across the various fellowship programs, a multisociety accreditation committee was formed with the intent to establish common accreditation standards for all IP fellowship programs in the United States. This article provides a summary of those standards and can serve as an accreditation template for training programs and their offices of graduate medical education as they move through the accreditation process."

        "abstract": "While there is a literature on the distribution of food stores across geographic and social space, much of this research uses cross-sectional data. Analyses attempting to understand whether the availability of stores across neighborhoods is associated with diet and/or health outcomes are limited by a lack of understanding of factors that shape the emergence of new stores and the closure of others. We used quarterly data on supermarket and convenience store locations spanning seven years (2006-2012) and tract-level census data in four US cities: Birmingham, Alabama; Chicago, Illinois; Minneapolis, Minnesota; San Francisco, California. A spatial discrete-time survival model was used to identify factors associated with an earlier and/or later closure time of a store. Sales volume was typically the strongest indicator of store survival. We identified heterogeneity in the association between tract-level poverty and racial composition with respect to store survival. Stores in high poverty, non-White tracts were often at a disadvantage in terms of survival length. The observed patterns of store survival varied by some of the same neighborhood sociodemographic factors associated with lifestyle and health outcomes, which could lead to confusion in interpretation in studies of the estimated effects of introduction of food stores into neighborhoods on health."

His model encourages incorporating learning formats that are conducive to most learners. 5 Importantly, learners' preferred styles may differ, but that should not matter because this model's implementation incorporates all learning styles. 1 A truly effective educational model facilitates an individual's ability to harness knowledge by incorporating different learning styles into the curriculum.",

The technique of responding to answers generated via ARSs must be learnercentered and address the correct but especially the incorrect answers. After a discussion of the available answer choices, the rationale for the correct answer choice is presented in subsequent supporting slides. This quadrant, because it involves a concrete experience, may also include workshops where instructors demonstrate and learners observe.

The challenge for instructors is to create opportunities for learners to experiment with their new knowledge in a safe environment. This can be accomplished by testing new ideas and skills in problem-based learning (PBL) exercises and game-based learning simulation. Learners can build on existing knowledge by incorporating new evidence and applying theory into practice. 1,8 Experimentation and risk-taking in a safe and controlled environment allows physicians to expand their armamentarium. Several bronchoscopy courses attempt to follow this model using PBL and simulation by structuring the workflow to engage each participant. Simulation laboratories mimic real-life scenarios to test newly acquired skills. Participants can analyze the impact of new knowledge and skills and evaluate the results. This cycle of learner-faculty interaction aims to provide new insight. Initially, the understanding and mastery of a skill can be incomplete and repetition is often required to minimize deficiencies.

His model encourages incorporating learning formats that are conducive to most learners. 5 Importantly, learners' preferred styles may differ, but that should not matter because this model's implementation incorporates all learning styles. 1 A truly effective educational model facilitates an individual's ability to harness knowledge by incorporating different learning styles into the curriculum.",

The technique of responding to answers generated via ARSs must be learnercentered and address the correct but especially the incorrect answers. After a discussion of the available answer choices, the rationale for the correct answer choice is presented in subsequent supporting slides.

The challenge for instructors is to create opportunities for learners to experiment with their new knowledge in a safe environment. This can be accomplished by testing new ideas and skills in problem-based learning (PBL) exercises and game-based learning simulation. Learners can build on existing knowledge by incorporating new evidence and applying theory into practice. 1,8 Experimentation and risk-taking in a safe and controlled environment allows physicians to expand their armamentarium. Several bronchoscopy courses attempt to follow this model using PBL and simulation by structuring the workflow to engage each participant. Simulation laboratories mimic real-life scenarios to test newly acquired skills. Participants can analyze the impact of new knowledge and skills and evaluate the results.

It is relevant for educators to know how best to design a curriculum whereby knowledge is delivered in an environment that fosters active learning. 1,2 Regarding bronchoscopy education, it is the authors' belief that any valid training program should demonstrate improvements in cognitive and technical knowledge and also lead to positive changes in clinicians' practice. This article describes the rationale and methodology of implementing experiential learning theory into bronchoscopy education programs. The experiential learning theory could be applied globally in bronchoscopy training programs because it addresses various learning styles affected by distinct personality traits and cultural factors.",

This model remains one of the most popular in medical education. 1 David Kolb theorized that the way people perceive and process an experience explains how they learn. 4 The emphasis on experience playing a central role in the learning process differentiates the experiential approach from other learning theories. His model encourages incorporating learning formats that are conducive to most learners. 5 Importantly, learners' preferred styles may differ, but that should not matter because this model's implementation incorporates all learning styles. 1 A truly effective educational model facilitates an individual's ability to harness knowledge by incorporating different learning styles into the curriculum.",

The diverging style applies to those learners who prefer to reflect on new information acquired through a concrete experience. This can be implemented through an interactive case-based session using an ARS or other techniques of engaging the learners (ie, think-pair-share). The technique of responding to answers generated via ARSs must be learnercentered and address the correct but especially the incorrect answers. After a discussion of the available answer choices, the rationale for the correct answer choice is presented in subsequent supporting slides. This quadrant, because it involves a concrete experience, may also include workshops where instructors demonstrate and learners observe. This format of simulation, in which the teachers demonstrate and the learners observe and reflect on what they see, is not the optimal way of implementing simulation.",

The challenge for instructors is to create opportunities for learners to experiment with their new knowledge in a safe environment. This can be accomplished by testing new ideas and skills in problem-based learning (PBL) exercises and game-based learning simulation. Learners can build on existing knowledge by incorporating new evidence and applying theory into practice. 1,8 Experimentation and risk-taking in a safe and controlled environment allows physicians to expand their armamentarium. Several bronchoscopy courses attempt to follow this model using PBL and simulation by structuring the workflow to engage each participant. Simulation laboratories mimic real-life scenarios to test newly acquired skills. Participants can analyze the impact of new knowledge and skills and evaluate the results. This cycle of learner-faculty interaction aims to provide new insight. Initially, the understanding and mastery of a skill can be incomplete and repetition is often required to minimize deficiencies.

When incorporated into a PBL model, the case scenarios are designed to ensure an authentic learning environment, such that the analytic skills required in this process are consistent with the cognitive demands of real-life patients. The learners work through the clinical scenario in a group. Working through a casebased exercise helps learners contemplate patient and procedure-related issues in a structured fashion.
