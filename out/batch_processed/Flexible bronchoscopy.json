In 1888, a team of physicians in Austria were the first to incorporate this concept into medical care when they developed bent glass rods for illuminating body cavities. In the 1920s and 1930s, multiple separate groups independently realized that, in addition to simple light transmission, images could also be transmitted through glass fiber bundles. 4 In 1954, physicists Hopkins and Kapany developed the first prototype flexible endoscope using fiberoptic bundles. 5 In 1958, Hirscowitz patented a flexible gastroscope to visualize the stomach. 6,7 In the early 1960s, Dr Ikeda, who was already experimenting with fiberoptic rigid telescopes, approached the Machida Endoscope CO, and the Olympus Optical Company with his vision for the first flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope. In 1964, Dr Ikeda presented the first prototype flexible bronchoscope at the 'IX International Congress of Diseases of the Chest' in Copenhagen, Denmark. 1 Although this early rendering had major limitations, including an inability to bend or direct the distal tip, and did not include a working channel, the clinical importance of the flexible bronchoscope was readily apparent to the society; his presentation was published in The New York Times shortly after the conference concluded. The first commercially available flexible bronchoscope, which allowed angulation of the distal tip, manufactured by Machida Company, was commercialized in 1968. This development was quickly followed by an Olympus bronchoscope that included a working channel for suction or passage of instruments. 1-3 Over the next few years, rapid improvements in image quality, flexibility, and angulation followed, and by the mid1970s the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope was being commonly used worldwide. A major advance occurred when Asahi Optical Company (later renamed Pentax Corporation), using the technology from video camcorders, could replace the flexible fiberoptic bundle system with a miniaturized charge-coupled device integrated into the distal tip of a bronchoscope, creating highquality video images that could be viewed on a large screen rather than just through an eyepiece. 1,8,9 As charge-coupled device technology progressed, newer generations of bronchoscopes with improved image quality and smaller footprints continue to be developed. Despite the advancements in video technology the fiberoptic technology used by Dr Ikeda has maintained its relevance in the form of hybrid bronchoscopes, which combine the minimal space requirements of the fiberoptic bundles with the superior video quality of the charge-coupled device chip allowing"

            "text": "The flexible bronchoscope opened a new era in bronchoscopy and, in the decades since its initial commercial release, there have been numerous innovations that have expanded the field of pulmonary medicine. Some of these innovations were originally used in rigid bronchoscopy, but were not widely adopted because of the limitations of reach and flexibility intrinsic to rigid instruments. One of the most important innovations in flexible bronchoscopy was in 1974 when Reynolds and Newball 10 first introduced bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). This innovation allowed bronchoscopists to obtain material from the lower respiratory tract to aid in the diagnosis of infectious, inflammatory, and malignant disease, while additionally influencing the understanding of the cellular response to diseases of the lung. Although transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) using a rigid bronchoscope had been used at selected centers for several years before the invention of the flexible bronchoscope, the inability to reach lesions with precision, particularly in the upper lobes, limited its clinical usefulness. 11,12 Dr Ikeda recognized the potential of the flexible bronchoscope in the diagnosis of malignancy and specifically designed the original commercially available bronchoscope with this in mind. The original forceps were rudimentary; however, as the design of the flexible forceps evolved, TBLB became a standard procedure easily learned and performed by the general pulmonologist. 13-15 Transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA), also originally developed for rigid bronchoscopy by Schiepatti in 1948, had the same limitations as rigid TBLB and was uncommonly performed. 16,17 Kato Oho first developed a needle that could be used through the flexible bronchoscope for the aspiration of paratracheal pathology in 1979, 1 year after Ko-Pen Wang first demonstrated the technique of mediastinal TBNA with the use of the rigid bronchoscope. These monumental achievements forever expanded the role of the bronchoscopist beyond disease of the airways, and were an essential step in the development of modern linear endobronchial ultrasound (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)) imaging. 18-20"

Although the optimal volume of infused saline is unknown, previous work demonstrated that instilled volume of less than 120 mL, yield inconsistent results. 47,48 In addition to the volume instilled, the volume returned also effects the adequacy of the sample and at least 30% of instilled volume is necessary to obtain adequate alveolar sampling. 46,49 The indication for BAL often dictates the sequence of procedures performed. For diagnosis of diffuse lung disease, BAL should be the first procedure performed, before other biopsy techniques to minimize blood contamination. In suspected malignancy, the primary goal is to obtain as much diagnostic material as possible, performing lavage after biopsy to increase capture of residual tumor elements. That being said, there is really a paucity of data with regard to the effect of sequence. In diffuse lung disease many recommend disposing of initial 20 to 30 mL of aspirated fluid to avoid contamination because this has been shown to contain mostly cells and proteins from the bronchial surfaces and not alveolar contents. 50 Again, this would be of less importance and potentially decrease diagnostic yield in malignancy. For diffuse lung disease, lavage is most commonly performed in the gravity-dependent areas such as the right middle lobe or lingula to maximize return, whereas in suspected localized infection of malignancy the target segment depends on the radiographic area of concern. 10 Risks of BAL are extremely low, with hypoxemia being the most common. 51 Low-grade fevers within the first 24 hours after lavage can occur in up to one-third of patients, likely related to induced cytokine activity, and typically do not represent actual infection. 52 Additionally, emergency department and hospital providers might be unaware that transient radiographic abnormalities are expected because of retained saline.

The most common complications associated with TBLB include pneumothorax and bleeding. 65 The incidence of pneumothorax depends on multiple factors to include with TBLB is type of forceps, use of mechanical ventilation, presence of surrounding emphysema, location of the lesion, operator experience, type of forceps, number of samples taken, and fluoroscopic guidance. 66 The rate of pneumothorax ranges between 1% and 5% in the general population, but is higher in the presence of the risk factors discussed. 67,68 TBLB can generally be performed under moderate sedation in a standard bronchoscopy suite with or without a fluoroscopy. The typical technique for TBLB is to advance the bronchoscope into a wedged position within the target airway and to advance the closed forceps into the target segment. If fluoroscopy is used, it should be activated when the tip of the forceps exits the working channel. The closed forceps are then advanced until gentle resistance is met and then pulled back 1 to 2 cm, at which point the forceps are opened and then advanced until resistance is reencountered, at which point the forceps are closed and retracted. If using fluoroscopy, one should watch the visceral pleural line closely while retracting the closed forceps. If the visceral pleura 'tents,' retraction should be stopped, while simultaneously opening the forceps, to avoid development of pneumothorax. If fluoroscopy is not used, the development of acute chest pain by the patient should be used as a marker of possible pleural retraction and the same steps applied. The general indications for the use of fluoroscopy are to localize a biopsy target in focal disease, for the prevention and detection of pneumothorax, and in localized disease processes. After biopsy, the bronchoscope is kept wedged with several biopsies performed in rapid succession. After biopsies are completed, the bronchoscope should remain in the wedged position for at least 1 minute before it is slowly retracted. 69 If continued bleeding is encountered, the bronchoscope should be rewedged to allow clot to for an additional 4 to 5 minutes. Fluoroscopy is recommended in the evaluation of focal lung disease and has been shown to improved diagnostic yield. 70 The need for fluoroscopy in the setting of diffuse interstitial lung disease is more controversial. In a 2002 survey of bronchoscopists in the UK, 57% of respondents never used fluoroscopy for transbronchial biopsy and 24% only use it occasionally. 71 In contrast a survey from Canada published in 2011, 68% of respondents reported"

The exceptions are disease processes, which follow a bronchocentric or centrilobular distribution, in which a diagnosis can often be made with relatively small samples such as sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, eosinophilic pneumonias, and lymphangitic spread of malignancy. 80 Given that most interstitial lung diseases with atypical radiologic features require surgical lung biopsy (or at a minimum bronchoscopic cryobiopsy) for diagnosis, most experts recommend obtaining a TBLB before advancing to the more high-risk procedures to exclude mimickers, which can often be confirmed on TBLB, such as sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, infection, and malignancy. 81 The yield of TBLB for focal peripheral lung lesions varies considerably with the location and size of the lesion, as well as the other modalities used to guide the biopsy.

With central TBNA, longer stiffer needles are typically used to provide the directed force required to penetrate the airway wall. 97 When the needle is inserted into the working channel of the bronchoscope care must be taken to keep the distal tip of the bronchoscope in a neutral position to avoid scope damage. In endobronchial or parabronchial lesions, once the tip of the catheter is visible outside the bronchoscope, the needle is extended outside of the catheter and locked before puncturing the airway wall as the target site. There are 4 common methods used to penetrate the needle tip through the airway wall and into the target lesion. The 'hub against the wall' technique where the catheter is in contact with the airway wall before needle extension, and the 'jabbing technique' in which the extended needle is quickly thrust forward through the airway wall by grasping the catheter at the insertion point of the working channel while the bronchoscope remains in a fixed position within the airway are the most commonly used methods. The 'piggyback method,' in which the bronchoscope is advanced toward the airway wall with the needle extended and locked in the out position, and the 'cough technique,' where the patient is instructed to cough to move the airway wall toward the locked and extended needle within the airway, are less frequently used. After the needle penetrates the airway wall, suction is applied through an attached syringe before agitating the needle back and forth within the lesion, and suction is released before withdrawing the needle into the airway to reduce aspirated bronchial tissue contamination of the specimen. Aspirated blood within the suction tubing suggests vascular puncture and the needle should be immediately retracted and introduced into a new puncture site. 94 In peripheral TBNA, the needle is advanced either directly thorough the working channel of the bronchoscope or through an extended sheath with fluoroscopic observation in a manner like TBLB. Once the outer protective sheath is within 1 to 2 cm of the lesion the needle is extended into the lesion and agitated with suction using the same technique as in central TBNA. 84"

            "text": "Severe hypoxemia is a relative contraindication to flexible bronchoscopy. However, there is no specific minimum PO2 or oxygen saturation that must be maintained during the bronchoscopy. Additionally, bronchoscopy is often performed for the purpose of improving oxygenation, such as in a patient with pulmonary hemorrhage or atelectasis related to mucous plugging or foreign body aspiration. In a study by Albertini and colleagues, 108 evaluating changes in PO 2 during bronchoscopy by performing serial arterial blood gas analysis showed reductions of average reductions in PO 2 ranging from 4 to 38 mm Hg with an average decline of 20 mm Hg. Considering if a specific patient would be expected to tolerate this reduction can be useful in considering whether hypoxia should preclude bronchoscopy. In patients with significant hypoxemia undergoing biopsy, the risks are greater; complications of the biopsy, namely, hemorrhage and pneumothorax, can exacerbate hypoxemia in already tenuous patients. If the procedure cannot be postponed using general anesthesia, with a protected airway such as an endotracheal tube or rigid bronchoscope, should always be considered. In the intubated patient, prebronchoscopy hypoxia is less of an issue, and studies evaluating the risk of bronchoscopy in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome have shown it to be relatively safe. 109-111 There has been increasing attention drawn to the usefulness of high-flow nasal cannula during bronchoscopy. Although most published data specifically are related to patients in the intensive care unit, there are potential advantages in the outpatient setting as well in patients with borderline preprocedure oxygenation. Additionally, the small amount of positive end-expiratory pressure induced by high-flow oxygen likely provides some degree of pneumatic stenting, which can improve visualization of the airways and maneuverability of the bronchoscope. 112"

Complications were rare with only 2 patents developing arrhythmias related to the bronchoscopy. Only 5 patients in this review were not already intubated and 1 (20%) in this subgroup required intubation after the procedure. 116 This paper does not necessarily imply that the procedure is safe, but rather that it is safer in the previously intubated and deeply sedated patient because much of the theoretic risks are associated with the underlying adrenergic response and hypoxemia attributable to bronchoscopy in the moderately sedated patient. Additionally, one should consider that the degree of adrenergic response and potential hypoxemia associated with the bronchoscopy is variable depending on the complexity of the procedure. A simple lavage in a patient who is already intubated and deeply sedated will likely result in significantly less risk than in a moderate sedation bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsies. Again, just as in patients with significant hypoxia, the risks of inducing myocardial ischemia are likely greater when lung biopsy is performed because these patients are less likely to tolerate complications such as pneumothorax or bleeding. Although the data regarding the recommendation to avoid bronchoscopy within 4 to 6 weeks of myocardial infarction are limited, it is a reasonable precaution. In a setting where bronchoscopy cannot be delayed, we recommend maximizing oxygenation, minimizing suction to avoid tachycardia and hypoxemia, and providing adequate sedation and analgesia to reduce adrenergic response with a low threshold for terminating the procedure if evidence of acute ischemia develops. Although bronchoscopy using moderate sedation is generally considered safe for patients with stable coronary artery disease, hemodynamic changes associated with the procedure may induce ischemia in rare cases. 117"

The initial animal study evaluating the effect of clopidogrel with and without aspirin before TBLB in swine showed no significant increased bleeding risk. 121 However, when clopidogrel with or without aspirin was evaluated prospectively in humans, a substantial risk was identified, with bleeding occurring in 89% of patients on clopidogrel alone and 100% of patients on combination aspirin and clopidogrel therapy. 122 Current recommendations are to hold clopidogrel for 5 to 7 days before bronchoscopic biopsies. 106 When bronchoscopy cannot be delayed, in patients with continued need for thienopyridines, such as in drug-eluding stents placed within the previous 12 months, using a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor as a bridge could be considered in consultation with interventional cardiology. 123 Data regarding TBLB in the setting of thrombocytopenia are less robust; however, the available data support caution in severe thrombocytopenia. In a small study of 24 patients with platelet counts of less than 60,000/mm 3 as a result of chemotherapeutics or bone marrow invasion from malignancy who received platelet transfusions within the hour before intervention, significant bleeding occurred in 21% of patients, with 1 patient developing fatal pulmonary hemorrhage. 124"

After a few minutes, the mean arterial pressure does begin to return toward baseline and the ICP remains elevated, resulting in a reduction in the cerebral perfusion pressure in longer procedures. 130 Recently, Grosu and colleagues 131 published a retrospective evaluation of patients undergoing flexible or rigid bronchoscopy in the setting of malignant space-occupying brain lesions, of which 40% had evidence of increased ICP on preprocedural imaging.

In nonsevere PH, this has not been borne out in literature. 132,133 A recent observational review evaluating the safety of bronchoscopy with TBLB, endobronchial biopsy or TBNA in 107 patients with echocardiographic evidence of PH (pulmonary artery systolic pressure of /C21 36 mm Hg) compared with 83 patients without PH (pulmonary artery systolic pressure of <36 mm Hg). In this study, no difference in safety outcomes such as major bleeding, pneumothorax, sedation complications, or procedure-related deaths, were found. 134 Although it seems that TBLB is likely safe in patients with mild or moderate PH, there is very little evidence regarding the safety of bronchoscopy and TBLB in patients with severe PH.

White light flexible videobronchoscopy with its ancillary devices (forceps biopsy, bronchial brushing, bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial washings and transbronchial needle aspiration) has long been the only established diagnostic bronchoscopic technique. With the advances in microtechnology over the past two decades, recent technical developments such as autofluorescence bronchoscopy and endoscopic ultrasound allow better evaluation of endobronchial, mediastinal and parenchymal lesions."

Eighteen patients with abnormal chest radiographs had normal transbronchial forceps lung biopsies and no established diagnosis. Satisfactory specimens were obtained in 153 patients (93 per cent), with diagnositc accuracies of 62, 64, and 67 per cent, respectively, in infectious, interstitial, and malignant lung disease. The over-all diagnostic accuracy was 57 per cent. Seven patients were diagnosed as having metastatic carcinoma to the lung by transbronchial forceps lung biopsy, but brush biopsy was psoitive in only 3. Of the 23 patients with primary lung carcinoma diagnosed by transbronchial forceps lung biopsy, 21 had positive brush biopsies. An additional 3 patients with bronchogenic carcinoma, however, were diagnosed only by brush biopsy. Fluoroscopy was essential for accurate positioning of the biopsy instrument. Increased risk factors were present in 83 patients (51 per cent), among whom the immunosuppressed group presented special problems. Significant bleeding in 15 patients (9 per cent) was controlled by conservative management. Pneumothorax occurred in 7 patients (4 per cent). There were no deaths. Transbronchial forceps lung biopsy in experienced hands is safe and well tolerated. The physician, nevertheless, must be prepared to handle major complications, especially bleeding. The procedure has a resonable diagnostic yield in high-risk patients who have a variety of lung lesions."

The system included a 200W mercury vapor lamp and primary filter, flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope with special violet-transmitting light conductor, secondary filter, and image intensifier tube. Tests indicated the system could detect a tumor only 100 micron thick at the expected concentration of hematoporphyrin derivative: 1 microgram/gm at 48 to 96 hours following intravenous injection at a dosage of 2.5 mg/kg. Examination of resected specimens (six of lung, one of esophagus) showed positive fluorescence in all cases, with fluorescence visible beyond the region visible under conventional white light examination. Fluorescence bronchoscopy has been performed on four patients thus far. Positive fluorescence was observed in all three cases where the tumor had been known to occur. Positive fluorescence was also observed in the patient with sputum positive for lung cancer, but negative x-ray film findings. However, additional examinations are required to demonstrate the smallest lesion that can be detected in vivo."

The beam is carried through a flexible fibre delivering a power of 50 to 90 watts. It can be introduced through the biopsy channel of a standard bronchoscope, or through a fibrescope. Anaesthesia must avoid inflammable gases. In most cases, general anaesthesia was used, and ventilation achieved with a mixture of 50% nitrogen and oxygen, using a modification of the Sanders injector. One hundred and sixty-four cases have been treated in 317 sessions (from one to five sessions per patient). They comprised: 72 cancers, 24 of which had just been diagnosed and had acute respiratory obstruction. In 16, one single session restored the patency of the airway. Forty-eight other cases were recurrent carcinomas after either surgery or radiotherapy, nine of which were caused by cancers of other origin invading the trachea; 21 benign or moderately malignant tumours; 44 iatrogenic stenoses, including 31 narrow ones. Of those 31 cases, 17 had an immediate satisfactory result, but eight recurred; 24 granulomas on bronchial suture lines. There were two deaths not directly related to surgery or anaesthesia. Bleeding was never more than moderate. The main difficulty lies in the critical respiratory condition of the patients, sometimes seen in acute asphyxia, referred to us as a last resort, especially those with carcinomas involving the trachea or main bronchi."

To overcome these problems, we undertook the current study to evaluate the clinical utility of the newly developed ultrasound puncture bronchoscope to visualize and perform real-time TBNA of the mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes under direct endobronchial ultrasonography (EBUS) guidance."

Nondiagnostic bronchoscopy leads to more invasive interventions, such as transthoracic needle aspiration, mediastinoscopy or even thoracotomy. Electromagnetic navigation is a novel technology that facilitates approaching peripheral lung lesions, which are difficult to sample by conventional means. The navigation system involves creating an electromagnetic field around the chest and localizing an endoscopic tool using a microsensor overlaid upon previously acquired CT images."

This study describes the use of a flexible cryoprobe for cryotherapy using nitrous oxide as a cryogen through a fiberoptic bronchoscope. The study group consisted of 22 patients, ages ranging from 28 to 82 years. Twenty patients had malignant TBO and two had bronchial obstruction (BO) following lung transplantation. Benign BO was first dilated with a balloon and followed with cryotherapy. Eighteen of the 20 malignant endobronchial lesions were completely removed. In three of these patients, the airway remained occluded due to extrinsic compression. Cryotherapy offers an alternative to Nd:YAG laser in the management of TBO. Cryotherapy offers other advantages such as being inexpensive, safe for the operator, and safe for other members of the team. Similarly for the patient, there is no danger of bronchial wall perforation or endobronchial fires, cryotherapy can be done under local anesthesia with conscious sedation, and it can be performed in an endoscopy suite."

        "abstract": "Endobronchial electrosurgery is used to remove endobronchial lesions in the trachea and bronchi, using either a rigid or a flexible bronchoscope. The thermal property of electric current is used to destroy tissue or coagulate bleeding sites. Electrosurgery, electrocautery, electrotherapy, and surgical diathermy are terms often used when referring to the use of heat for tissue destruction. In this article, we specifically use the term electrocautery ( EC) to describe an electrosurgical technique that requires probe-to-tissue contact whereby the conduction of electric current ionizes air resulting in tissue destruction or hemostasis or both. In contrast, argon plasma coagulation (APC) is a relatively new electrosurgical method whereby argon gas is ionized by an electric current to create a noncontact, homogeneous \"bridge\" to target tissue for coagulation or ablation. Both EC and APC are effective in ablating and coagulating tissue. In this article, we further elucidate the basic principles of electrosurgery; indications, complications, and techniques associated with both EC and APC; and how they compare with other standard endobronchial interventions, including mechanical debridement, laser photoresection, cryotherapy, photodynamic therapy (PDT), and brachytherapy."

        "abstract": "Brush and forceps biopsies were done consecutively in 186 cases of pulmonary neoplasia with a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope guided by x-ray television fluoroscopy. Imprint and histologic sections were prepared from all forceps biopsy specimens. The three techniques were compared for their diagnostic sensitivity. As a result 84.9% of all imprints, 80.6% of brush biopsy specimens, and 62.9% of histologic sections were positive for malignancy. The sensitivity of brush biopsy specimens was independent of the location and morphology of the tumors, but the sensitivity of forceps biopsy specimens was lower in neoplasms unidentified by bronchoscopy. The sensitivity of the diagnostic accuracy when all three methods were used jointly was 97.3%, and the specificity was 100%. Agreement in the final morphologic tumor type was found in 130 of 150 cases (86.7%) by positive brush biopsy specimens, in 136 of 158 cases (86.1%) by positive imprint cytology, and in 104 of 117 cases (88.9%) by positive histology from forceps biopsy specimens. For routine bronchoscopy, all three methods should be used in combination to obtain the highest diagnostic yield."

The ILD group had more cells aspirated after the second half than after the first half of the BAL, whereas the control group did not. Abnormalities in the cell population of the BAL fluid were more striking when the larger volume was used."

Although lavage recovers only those cells and proteins present on the epithelial surface of the lower respiratory tract, comparison with open lung biopsies shows that these constituents are representative of the inflammatory and immune systems of the alveolar structures. With the use of these techniques, sufficient materials are obtained from normal individuals to allow characterization of not only the types of cells and proteins present but their functions as well. Such observations have been useful in defining the inflammatory and immune capabilities of the normal lung and provide a basis for the study of lung disease. Lavage methods have been used to characterize inflammatory and immune processes of the lower respiratory tract in destructive, infectious, neoplastic, and interstitial disorders. From the data already acquired, it is apparent that bronchoalveolar lavage will yield major insights into the pathogenesis, staging, and therapy decisions involved in these disorders.

A number of modifications have been suggested in order to obtain samples relatively enriched for bronchial material. In order to be able to use a standard technique for bronchoalveolar lavage to sample both airways and \"routine\" alveolar material, a simple modification of the technique as described by Reynolds and Newball was used: five sequential 20-ml aliquots were infused into the lower respiratory tract, and each aliquot was immediately aspirated. The return from the first aliquot was processed separately from the return from the subsequent four aliquots. These last four aliquots were pooled. Analysis of the first aliquot revealed it to be enriched for ciliated epithelial cells when compared with the subsequent aliquots. There were also differences in inflammatory cell composition with the bronchial sample containing relatively more neutrophils and relatively less lymphocytes. Aspiration during transoral bronchoscopy was documented by quantifying salivary amylase in the bronchial and alveolar lavage fluids. It was estimated, however, that the aspiration was not of quantitative significance in the vast majority of subjects studied. Finally, with the technique of fractional processing of bronchoalveolar lavage samples, it was possible to compare the protein concentrations in bronchial and alveolar lavages. Most prominent among the differences was a marked relative enrichment in the bronchial samples for immunoglobulin A. The technique of fractional processing of bronchoalveolar lavage samples provides a simple means to obtain samples enriched for bronchial and alveolar components. This should facilitate analysis of lower respiratory tract specimens in airway disease."

Those individuals developing complications had a wide range of physiologic findings; functional tests could not predict which subjects were more likely to develop minor complications associated with lavage. These findings suggest that bronchoalveolar lavage for interstitial disease is a safe procedure associated with minor risks."

The aim of the present study was to investigate factors mediating these side effects. Fifty consecutive patients with various pulmonary diseases who underwent FOB without further interventions (n = 30) or combined with BAL (n = 20) were enrolled. Serum levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha were determined directly prior to (t0), directly after (t1), and 6 h after (t2) the procedures by ELISA. In parallel, blood cultures were drawn at t2. At to and t1, generally only low cytokine concentrations could be detected. At t2, however, significant increases of cytokine levels were found. IL-6 and TNF-alpha were significantly higher in patients after BAL than in patients after FOB. Comparing patients who developed fever (n = 12) with those who did not (n = 38), irrespective of the endoscopic procedures performed, dramatic increases of all three cytokines were detected in febrile patients that were significantly higher than in patients without fever. In the FOB group only patients who received local anesthesia by prilocaine bolus injection into the airways via the working channel of the bronchoscope developed fever and increases of IL-6 and IL-beta, whereas patients anaesthetized by inhalation of a prilocaine aerosol remained afebrile and had slight IL-6 increases only. There was a highly significant correlation between IL-6 values at t2 and the number of BAL alveolar macrophages (r = 0.98). All blood cultures remained sterile. These results indicate that fever after FOB and BAL is induced by proinflammatory cytokines derived from alveolar macrophages activated by instillation of fluid into the airways."

A total of 162 patients with biopsy- or autopsy-proven cancer had an analysis of BAL fluid performed. Cytologic examination showed malignant cells in 123 (76%) patients. The diagnostic accuracy varied depending on the neoplastic nature and growth pattern of the disease. BAL disclosed cancer cells in 93% of 44 bronchioloalveolar carcinomas. Carcinomatous lymphangitis due to metastatic cancer was diagnosed in 83% of 69 cases. Hematogenous metastases (with sharply circumscribed nodules on chest radiography) were diagnosed in 45% of 22 such cases. We recognized 67% of 15 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and 3 of 9 cases of Hodgkin's disease with pulmonary involvement. Immunocytochemistry using monoclonal and/or polyclonal antibodies was of value in the identification and classification of cells in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."

Major complications (respiratory arrest, pneumonia, pneumothorax, and obstruction of airways) occurred in 1.7 per cent (15) of the procedures. There was one death, yielding a mortality of 0.1%. Minor complications, including vasovagal reactions, fever, cardiac arrhythmias, bleeding, obstruction of airways, nausea and vomiting, pneumothorax, psychotic reaction, and aphonia, occurred in 6.5% of the procedures. Pneumothorax occurred after 5% (four) of 85 transbronchial biopsies. Although serious complications occur more frequently than previously reported from retrospective studies, complications after fiberoptic bronchoscopic procedures are still quite infrequent. The relative risks and benefits must always be carefully weighed in patients being considered for a fiberoptic bronchoscopic procedure."

In a collected series of 438 patients, the incidence of mild to \"explosive\" hemorrhage was 9 percent in \"routine\" cases, 29 percent (eight) in 31 immunosuppressed patients, and 45 percent (five) in 11 uremic patients. One death resulted from massive hemorrhage. A new \"wedge\" method of transbronchial forceps biopsy is now being utilized in our bronchoscopic unit. The tip of the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope is lodged into the appropriate segmental bronchus to tamponade any bleeding and, thus, prevent blood from flooding the airway. Careful screening of patients and competence in procedural techniques are necessary. Otherwise, transbronchial forceps biopsy should be performed through a rigid open-tube bronchoscopicronchoscope or performed through a rigid open-tube bronchoscope or lung tissue should be obtained via thoracotomy."

Tissue diagnosis from these lesions is usually obtained by transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB). The lesion location is estimated by chest radiograph (CXR) or computerized tomography (CT) of the chest. The diagnostic yield of TBLB is limited and variable, ranging from 16-80%. Fluoroscopy is used simultaneously with FOB during TBLB for better localization of parenchymatous lesions. Nevertheless, fluoroscopy-guided transbronchial biopsy (Flu-TBLB) is not widely used at present. The advantages and safety of Flu-TBLB have not yet been verified."

In view of this, and the authors' own observations of individual variation in preparation and technique, a national survey of bronchoscopic procedure was performed to assess physicians' methods. A structured questionnaire was mailed to 547 consultant physicians in adult respiratory medicine. Physicians' routines of patient preparation, drug therapy, sampling methods, and experience of complications with the flexible bronchoscope were assessed. A 60% response (328 physicians) was obtained. Patient consent was obtained by a junior doctor in 31% of replies. 205 (63%) physicians gave benzodiazepine sedation, 46 (14%) used opioid, and 38 (12%) administered both. Ninety-four (29%) physicians prescribed an antimuscarinic agent, and 235 (74%) gave antibiotics to patients with mechanical heart valves. Only 22% of physicians monitored electrocardiogram and 10% monitored blood pressure during all procedures. Marked variance was noted in sampling routines of suspected lung tumours. Physicians who used fluoroscopic guidance for transbronchial lung biopsy reported a significantly lower incidence of pneumothorax requiring drain insertion over the previous 12 months compared to those who did not (2.68 of 1000 versus 9.17 of 1000, (p&lt;0.03)), but no difference in the total incidence of pneumothorax. Only 87 (27%) of responders had performed transbronchial needle aspiration sampling over the previous 12 months. The preparation and practice of flexible bronchoscopy varies greatly for each physician. Use of radiographical screening for performing transbronchial lung biopsy was associated with a lower likelihood of pneumothorax requiring chest tube drainage."

Patient records and bronchoscopy reports for 112 transbronchial biopsies performed with fluoroscopy over a seven-year period were reviewed and compared with those of 135 transbronchial biopsies performed without fluoroscopy over the same interval. Complication rates with regard to pneumothorax, fever, and hemorrhage were compared, as were yield data for neoplasm, sarcoidosis, and other miscellaneous pulmonary diagnoses. Complication rates were low in both groups and not statistically different; yield data were likewise comparable, particularly in diffuse neoplasm and sarcoidosis. This report suggests that TBB without fluoroscopy (in the basilar segments) is safe and that diagnostic yield, particularly in sarcoidosis and diffuse neoplasm, is good."

We have compared the results of transbronchial biopsy performed with or without fluoroscopic guidance in patients with diffuse roentgenographic infiltrates who had or were suspected of having the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Neither the sensitivity for Pneumocystis carinii (88.5 versus 92%) nor the percentage of patients developing pneumothoraces after transbronchial biopsy (8.6 versus 11.1%) was significantly different in those patients who had the procedure without fluoroscopic guidance compared with those in whom fluoroscopy was used. There were no patients with significant hemorrhage or deaths in either group.

The risk-benefit ratio of TBB currently is debated, since several authors have found that the less invasive BAL may provide as much information as TBB, with the avoidance of some biopsy-related side effects. We retrospectively evaluated 157 instances of bronchoscopy carried out on 142 immunocompromised patients, with both BAL and TBB performed in every case. Immunosuppressant conditions were HIV infection (79), hematologic malignancies (36), and antirejection therapy in renal transplant recipients (27). Transbronchial biopsy provided a diagnostic yield significantly higher than that obtained by BAL in all categories investigated; diagnostic rates were 77.3% for TBB and 47.6% for BAL (p &lt; 0.001) in patients with HIV infection, 55 and 20% (p &lt; 0.001) in patients with hematologic malignancies, and 57.5 and 27.2% (p &lt; 0.001) in renal transplant recipients. Looking at the whole series, the diagnostic rates of TBB and BAL were 67.5 and 36.3%, respectively (p &lt; 0.001), with a total additional yield of 33% provided by TBB, while in only 2% of cases BAL gave rise to diagnostic information not achieved by TBB. Considering that side effects followed TBB at a negligible rate (2.5%), we believe that TBB should be routinely carried out in these patients once the diagnostic strategy has been oriented to bronchoscopy."

        "abstract": "Few studies have evaluated how the results of bronchoscopic lung biopsy (BLB) affect clinical management. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the clinical usefulness of BLB in the overall management of patients with diffuse pulmonary diseases. The study was a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent fluoroscopy-guided BLB over a 2-yr period. Patients whose biopsy was of a lung mass or single dominant lung nodule were excluded. The usefulness of BLB was assessed to determine whether the results affected the clinical management of these patients. During the study period, 603 patients underwent 651 BLB procedures. The results of BLB were clinically helpful in 494 (75.9%) out of 651 procedures. No diagnostic abnormality was identified in 107 (16.4%) out of the 651 biopsy procedures. This finding was clinically helpful in 59 (55.1%) out of 107 procedures, as the results excluded specific processes suspected before BLB. In 52 procedures (8% of all BLB), no lung parenchyma was obtained. In conclusion, bronchoscopic lung biopsy is a clinically useful test in approximately 75% of procedures. In the 25% of bronchoscopic lung biopsies that were clinically unhelpful, the reason for failure in approximately one-third of patients was the failure of the procedure to obtain an adequate quantity of lung parenchyma for a meaningful histological analysis."

        "abstract": "This study prospectively compared the diagnostic yield of transbronchial biopsies using large and small forceps (cup sizes, 3 x 2 x 0.9 versus 2 x 1.5 x 0.6 mm, respectively). Diagnostic yield was compared by a pathologist, blinded to the size of forceps used on the basis of the relative amount of tissue obtained, alveolar tissue obtained, and ability to ascertain a histopathologic diagnosis. Large forceps obtained significantly more tissue than did small forceps (20 of 27 patients [74%] versus five of 27 patients [19%], p &lt; 0.005, with similar amounts obtained in two patients). Also, large forceps obtained significantly more alveolar tissue than did small forceps (16 of 22 patients [73%] versus six of 22 patients [27%], p &lt; 0.05, with no alveolar tissue obtained in five patients). In 18 of the 27 patients, biopsies performed resulted in nonspecific diagnoses, including fibrosis or chronic inflammation. All nine of the patients with a specific diagnosis were ultimately proved to have sarcoidosis. There was a trend toward more of these patients having noncaseating granulomas obtained with the large forceps than with the small forceps (seven of nine patients versus four of nine patients). No difference was observed in the amount of postbiopsy bleeding with either forceps. We conclude that large forceps used for transbronchial biopsy yield more tissue and more alveolar tissue than do small forceps. These findings may have an impact on the diagnostic yield in some diseases such as sarcoidosis."

We attempted to perform TBNA in 37 patients referred to our hospital for diagnostic evaluation of radiographically evident peripheral masses (23 cases) or nodules (14 cases). None of them had bronchoscopic evidence of endobronchial lesion. The aspirations were performed under fluoroscopic guidance, through a fibreoptic bronchoscope, employing a 21-gauge, 1.3 cm aspirating needle. They were preceded by bronchial brushing and followed by transbronchial biopsy (TBB) of the peripheral lesion. In two cases, the apical nodules were not accessible by any of these procedures. Bronchial washings were also collected immediately after each procedure (brush, TBNA and TBB). TBNA was diagnostic in 23 of 37 patients (62%) rendering the TBNA yield considerably higher than washing (24%), brushing (27%) or TBB (38%). The addition of TBNA to the combination of TBB, brushing and washing, significantly increased the yield of fibreoptic bronchoscopy in our series from 46% to 70%. No significant complications, such as pneumothorax or major bleeding, occurred either with TBNA or TBB. In conclusion, our findings suggest that transbronchial needle aspiration is a safe procedure, that can improve the diagnostic yield of bronchoscopy in the diagnosis of peripheral lung masses or nodules."

The many publications produced about EBUS-TBNA have led to a better understanding of the performance characteristics of this procedure. The goal of this document was to examine the current literature on the technical aspects of EBUS-TBNA as they relate to patient, technology, and proceduralist factors to provide evidence-based and expert guidance to clinicians."

However, it is usually underutilized by pulmonologist. One of the main reasons given for not performing cTBNA is the risk of puncturing vascular structures of the mediastinum. Recently, with the twofold objective of minimize the risk of bleeding and reduce the cTBNA cost, a thinner and less expensive needle has been commercialized. It is a 23 gauge (G) needle that costs 34, 37 &#x20ac;. The aim of our study was to analyze the sample adequacy, diagnostic accuracy and safety of this needle in comparison with 21 and 22 G needles (average cost: 6,400 &#x20ac;)."

        "abstract": "Transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) for diagnosis and staging of bronchogenic carcinoma has evolved in the USA since the late 1970's. Initial reports advised that aspirated specimens be flushed into a container by normal saline or Hank's solution and processed in a cytology laboratory usually by Millipore filter and other techniques. A highly sophisticated cytology laboratory is the key to the success of this procedure. This study was designed to assess a simpler alternative method of processing the specimen by a direct smear technique. From June 1990 to September 1990, 40 procedures were performed on 34 consecutive patients. Seventy two paired direct smear and fluid specimens for cytology examination were collected. Fifty specimens were found to be negative in both types of specimen preparation. Fifteen were found to be positive in both types of specimens preparation, and six specimens were found to be positive only in the direct smear preparation. One of the 72 specimens was found to be positive in the Millipore and other preparation techniques. Based on our data, we conclude that the use of the direct smear for TBNA specimen preparation is an effective, simpler, and improved method. Proper use of it may increase the diagnostic yield and result in better acceptance of this new procedure."

Out of 1,630 bronchoscopic procedures, 633 patients (39 percent) had TBNA performed as part of the initial examination. Mediastinal nodes were sampled in 86 percent of the patients who had TBNA performed, and 127 (23 percent) of 547 of these aspirates were positive. Other areas of mucosal abnormality of the tracheobronchial tree were also sampled by TBNA under direct vision and showed malignant cells in 44 (25 percent) of 176 aspirates. Of 363 patients first diagnosed as having carcinoma of the lung who had TBNA of N2 nodes, 41 (59 percent) of 70 with small-cell tumors were positive, as were 83 (28 percent) of 293 with non-small-cell malignant neoplasms. Comparison of cytologic results obtained by TBNA with histologic material in 109 cases showed an excellent correlation. In 31 cases (4 percent of all TBNA), the aspirate provided the sole means of establishing the diagnosis of cancer. Two patients were thought to have false-positive aspirates. No complications of therapeutic significance were encountered. We believe that TBNA is a safe and effective way to assess mediastinal lymphatic involvement in the staging of lung cancer and that TBNA can be safely performed as part of the initial bronchoscopic examination in patients suspected of having malignant neoplasms of the chest."

Two hundred and thirty one physicians were carrying out bronchoscopy; they had performed about 40 000 bronchoscopies in the preceding year, 87% of these being fibreoptic procedures with topical anaesthesia. The mortality rate of fibreoptic bronchoscopy was 0.04%, with a 0.12% incidence of major complications. Transbronchial biopsy carried both an appreciably higher mortality rate of 0.12% and a major complication rate of 2.7%. There is wide variation in the use and choice of sedative drugs for fibreoptic bronchoscopy. Many of the drug combinations could be criticised on pharmacological grounds. The mean dose of lignocaine was 342 mg, most operators exceeding the usual maximum recommended dose; but adverse reactions were rare. Routine supplemental oxygen was given by only 18% of bronchoscopists. Basic resuscitation equipment was often inadequate. Radiological screening was used for transbronchial lung biopsy by 53% of respondents and significantly reduced the incidence of pneumothorax from 2.9% to 1.8%. Both the number of bronchoscopies performed and the complication rate were higher than previous estimates. Bronchoscopists should re-examine their policy on drugs and safety precautions to minimise the risks of the procedure."

        "abstract": "Although shown to be safe in many other lung disorders, the safety of fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in critically ill patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains unproven. We conducted a prospective study to evaluate the safety of BAL in patients with ARDS. There were 438 patients with ARDS at our institution during the study period. Of these, 110 underwent FOB and BAL for either research or clinical purposes. Data were collected at baseline, at 5-min intervals during the procedure, and 1 h after the procedure. We did not detect any statistically or clinically significant changes in PaO2/FlO2, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, peak inspiratory pressure, or static thoracic compliance after the procedure. A small decrease in SaO2 occurred after BAL. Although this change was statistically significant, the magnitude was not of clinical importance. Five patients (4.5%) had transient arterial oxygen desaturation to &lt; 90% during FOB and one patient (0.9%) experienced desaturation to &lt; 80%. There were no prolonged episodes of severe hypoxemia. No serious bleeding occurred. One pneumothorax developed during the procedure. No deaths occurred that were related to the procedure. We conclude that FOB and BAL can be performed safely and are reasonably well-tolerated in patients with ARDS."

Problems with oxygenation during FOB are well-recognised, but there are few data about its cardiovascular effects. Forty five patients (median age 65 yrs) undergoing elective FOB were studied prospectively. Patients were connected to a 12-lead computerized electrocardiographic recorder, a finger plethysmographic blood pressure (FPBP) monitor and pulse oximeter. Forty three patients were sedated with fentanyl and droperidol, and all were given 5 mL 2.5% cocaine intratracheally and xylocaine spray to the pharynx. Mean sphygmomanometric cuff blood pressure was raised initially (167/88 mmHg). Mean blood pressure recorded by FPBP rose on intratracheal injection (178/96 mmHg) and remained high throughout the procedure. Mean (SD) initial cardiac frequency was 93 (5.1) beats x min(-1) and rose to 134 (7.5) beats x min(-1) during the procedure. Four of the 45 patients showed unexpected ST segment depression of &gt;1 mm for &gt;1 min, and a further three developed bundle branch block. These seven patients had significantly greater tachycardia (152 vs 131 beats x min(-1)) and higher blood pressure (238/131 vs 207/109 mmHg). They were older (72 vs 61 yrs), had smoked more (63 vs 39 pack-years), but had similar lung function and similar changes in oxygen saturation. Oxygen desaturation occurred in 19 patients and this was associated with poor lung function (69 vs 84% predicted forced expiratory volume in one second), but was independent of the cardiovascular changes. Significant cardiovascular changes occur during fibreoptic bronchoscopy, with evidence of cardiac strain in 21% of patients over the age of 60 yrs."

        "abstract": "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is generally considered to increase the risk of flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FFB). Currently, to our knowledge, no data in the literature support or challenge this concept. We conducted a retrospective chart review for the years 1986 to 1994 of 20 patients (14 men) who underwent 21 FFBs while hospitalized for an AMI. The mean age was 63.8 years (range, 38 to 83 years). Ten patients underwent revascularization procedures (eight coronary artery bypass grafting and two percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) before FFB. The mean period between the AMI and FFB was 11.7 days (range, 1 to 30 days). Indications for FFB were pulmonary infiltrate (n = 10), hemoptysis (n = 6), atelectasis (n = 4), and to localize a suspected bronchopleural fistula (n = 1). Procedures performed included airway examination (21), BAL (12), transbronchial biopsy (2), endobronchial biopsy (3), and endobronchial brushing (4). No procedure was interrupted as a result of an adverse event, and five patients died during the same hospitalization. Four of the deaths occurred 6 to 15 days postprocedure; 1 patient (who had active ischemia at the time of FFB) died 4 h postprocedure. We conclude that FFB is safe in the immediate post-AMI period as long as the patient does not have active ischemia at the time of the procedure."

In immunosuppressed patients, the available diagnostic procedures are often invasive and have variable yield and a potential for serious complications. Bronchoalveolar lavage had an overall diagnostic yield of 66% (61 of 92 diseases). It was most effective in the diagnosis of opportunistic infections, including infection with Pneumocystis carinii (18 of 22 cases), cytomegalovirus pneumonia (10 of 12 cases), fungal pneumonia (5 of 6 cases), and mycobacterial disease (4 of 5 cases). The technique was also helpful in suspected pulmonary hemorrhage (7 of 9 cases) but was less useful for diagnosing malignancy (10 of 22 cases) and drug-induced toxicity (6 of 15 cases). Findings of bronchoalveolar lavage could be combined with those of transbronchial biopsies, brushings, and washings in the diagnosis of most of the diseases. The procedure was safe, even in thrombocytopenic patients and those requiring mechanical ventilatory support. Bronchoalveolar lavage is a valuable procedure for evaluation of pulmonary disease in the immunosuppressed host."

Bronchoalveolar lavage was useful in detecting the presence of Pneumocystis carinii, viruses, fungi, bacteria, and mycobacteria in the lower respiratory tract. P. carinii was diagnosed by bronchoalveolar lavage in 17 patients and by open-lung biopsy in 1. Other organisms detected by lavage, lung biopsy, or both included viruses (eight patients), fungi (four patients), bacteria (six patients), and mycobacteria (three patients). Of the 100 patients studied, 33 had infectious agents detected in the lung; in 6 of these patients, more than one organism was present. Bronchoalveolar lavage detected the infectious organisms in 30 of the patients, in many of whom an open-lung biopsy was likely avoided because of the lavage studies. Although no major complications of bronchoalveolar lavage were noted in this critically ill population, five patients did require short-term mechanical ventilation after bronchoscopy. When correctly used, bronchoalveolar lavage is a safe and useful procedure for the assessment of immunocompromised subjects with suspected opportunistic pulmonary infections."

It has been shown to be a safe procedure with only occasional complications. However, in patients with head injuries, FB can lead to intracranial hypertension. Sustained increases in intracranial pressure (ICP) leads to poor outcome in these patients. Because of this, a prospective study was done not only to assess the effect of FB on ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) in patients with brain injuries, but also to identify a regimen of sedation and anesthesia that could prevent significant increases in ICP during FB."

In 1888, a team of physicians in Austria were the first to incorporate this concept into medical care when they developed bent glass rods for illuminating body cavities. In the 1920s and 1930s, multiple separate groups independently realized that, in addition to simple light transmission, images could also be transmitted through glass fiber bundles. 4 In 1954, physicists Hopkins and Kapany developed the first prototype flexible endoscope using fiberoptic bundles. 5 In 1958, Hirscowitz patented a flexible gastroscope to visualize the stomach. 6,7 In the early 1960s, Dr Ikeda, who was already experimenting with fiberoptic rigid telescopes, approached the Machida Endoscope CO, and the Olympus Optical Company with his vision for the first flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope. In 1964, Dr Ikeda presented the first prototype flexible bronchoscope at the 'IX International Congress of Diseases of the Chest' in Copenhagen, Denmark. 1 Although this early rendering had major limitations, including an inability to bend or direct the distal tip, and did not include a working channel, the clinical importance of the flexible bronchoscope was readily apparent to the society; his presentation was published in The New York Times shortly after the conference concluded. The first commercially available flexible bronchoscope, which allowed angulation of the distal tip, manufactured by Machida Company, was commercialized in 1968. This development was quickly followed by an Olympus bronchoscope that included a working channel for suction or passage of instruments. 1-3 Over the next few years, rapid improvements in image quality, flexibility, and angulation followed, and by the mid1970s the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope was being commonly used worldwide. A major advance occurred when Asahi Optical Company (later renamed Pentax Corporation), using the technology from video camcorders, could replace the flexible fiberoptic bundle system with a miniaturized charge-coupled device integrated into the distal tip of a bronchoscope, creating highquality video images that could be viewed on a large screen rather than just through an eyepiece. 1,8,9 As charge-coupled device technology progressed, newer generations of bronchoscopes with improved image quality and smaller footprints continue to be developed. Despite the advancements in video technology the fiberoptic technology used by Dr Ikeda has maintained its relevance in the form of hybrid bronchoscopes, which combine the minimal space requirements of the fiberoptic bundles with the superior video quality of the charge-coupled device chip allowing",

Although the optimal volume of infused saline is unknown, previous work demonstrated that instilled volume of less than 120 mL, yield inconsistent results. 47,48 In addition to the volume instilled, the volume returned also effects the adequacy of the sample and at least 30% of instilled volume is necessary to obtain adequate alveolar sampling. 46,49 The indication for BAL often dictates the sequence of procedures performed. For diagnosis of diffuse lung disease, BAL should be the first procedure performed, before other biopsy techniques to minimize blood contamination. In suspected malignancy, the primary goal is to obtain as much diagnostic material as possible, performing lavage after biopsy to increase capture of residual tumor elements. That being said, there is really a paucity of data with regard to the effect of sequence. In diffuse lung disease many recommend disposing of initial 20 to 30 mL of aspirated fluid to avoid contamination because this has been shown to contain mostly cells and proteins from the bronchial surfaces and not alveolar contents. 50 Again, this would be of less importance and potentially decrease diagnostic yield in malignancy. For diffuse lung disease, lavage is most commonly performed in the gravity-dependent areas such as the right middle lobe or lingula to maximize return, whereas in suspected localized infection of malignancy the target segment depends on the radiographic area of concern. 10 Risks of BAL are extremely low, with hypoxemia being the most common. 51 Low-grade fevers within the first 24 hours after lavage can occur in up to one-third of patients, likely related to induced cytokine activity, and typically do not represent actual infection. 52 Additionally, emergency department and hospital providers might be unaware that transient radiographic abnormalities are expected because of retained saline.

The most common complications associated with TBLB include pneumothorax and bleeding. 65 The incidence of pneumothorax depends on multiple factors to include with TBLB is type of forceps, use of mechanical ventilation, presence of surrounding emphysema, location of the lesion, operator experience, type of forceps, number of samples taken, and fluoroscopic guidance. 66 The rate of pneumothorax ranges between 1% and 5% in the general population, but is higher in the presence of the risk factors discussed. 67,68 TBLB can generally be performed under moderate sedation in a standard bronchoscopy suite with or without a fluoroscopy. The typical technique for TBLB is to advance the bronchoscope into a wedged position within the target airway and to advance the closed forceps into the target segment. If fluoroscopy is used, it should be activated when the tip of the forceps exits the working channel. The closed forceps are then advanced until gentle resistance is met and then pulled back 1 to 2 cm, at which point the forceps are opened and then advanced until resistance is reencountered, at which point the forceps are closed and retracted. If using fluoroscopy, one should watch the visceral pleural line closely while retracting the closed forceps. If the visceral pleura 'tents,' retraction should be stopped, while simultaneously opening the forceps, to avoid development of pneumothorax. If fluoroscopy is not used, the development of acute chest pain by the patient should be used as a marker of possible pleural retraction and the same steps applied. The general indications for the use of fluoroscopy are to localize a biopsy target in focal disease, for the prevention and detection of pneumothorax, and in localized disease processes. After biopsy, the bronchoscope is kept wedged with several biopsies performed in rapid succession. After biopsies are completed, the bronchoscope should remain in the wedged position for at least 1 minute before it is slowly retracted. 69 If continued bleeding is encountered, the bronchoscope should be rewedged to allow clot to for an additional 4 to 5 minutes. Fluoroscopy is recommended in the evaluation of focal lung disease and has been shown to improved diagnostic yield. 70 The need for fluoroscopy in the setting of diffuse interstitial lung disease is more controversial. In a 2002 survey of bronchoscopists in the UK, 57% of respondents never used fluoroscopy for transbronchial biopsy and 24% only use it occasionally. 71 In contrast a survey from Canada published in 2011, 68% of respondents reported",

          "nvestigators many argue that the integration of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) imaging into training programs has a negative effect on the quality of conventional TBNA, a recent retrospective review suggests otherwise. In this study, after the integration of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) TBNA, diagnostic yields increased for conventional TBNA performed in the station 7 and 4R lymph nodes. 86 Overall, TBNA has largely been replaced by Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) TBNA for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis, with a randomized trial showing its inferiority to Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) TBNA for diagnosing stage I and II sarcoidosis. 87 However, within the station 7 and 4R lymph nodes, conventional TBNA is still excellent with diagnostic yields comparable to that of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) TBNA. 88 Conventional TBNA remains an important tool in the sampling of endobronchial tumors, especially when the tumor is covered by mucosa or necrosis debris, which would limit the diagnostic usefulness of endobronchial forceps or brushes. 89 For the diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary lesions, TBNA has rapidly expanded in recent years largely owing to the availability of newer tools to improve localization of lesions, such as radial probe Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) imaging and electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy. 90,91 Major factors that influence diagnostic yield with peripheral TBNA include lesion size, location, and relationship to the bronchus. 92 TBNA has been shown to improve the diagnostic yield when added to standard conventional bronchoscopic techniques such as TBLB and brushing for peripheral lesions. 84,93 An advantage of TBNA over other conventional biopsy techniques is the ability to easily obtain rapid onsite cytologic evaluation, which can confirm sampling of target lesions and, if negative, prompt the bronchoscopist to modify their approach. Touch imprint cytology obtained from TBLB can also be evaluated with rapid onsite cytologic evaluation; however, cytologists are often less comfortable with this technique and data are lacking regarding the diagnostic accuracy from bronchoscopically obtained specimens. 45",

With central TBNA, longer stiffer needles are typically used to provide the directed force required to penetrate the airway wall. 97 When the needle is inserted into the working channel of the bronchoscope care must be taken to keep the distal tip of the bronchoscope in a neutral position to avoid scope damage. In endobronchial or parabronchial lesions, once the tip of the catheter is visible outside the bronchoscope, the needle is extended outside of the catheter and locked before puncturing the airway wall as the target site. There are 4 common methods used to penetrate the needle tip through the airway wall and into the target lesion. The 'hub against the wall' technique where the catheter is in contact with the airway wall before needle extension, and the 'jabbing technique' in which the extended needle is quickly thrust forward through the airway wall by grasping the catheter at the insertion point of the working channel while the bronchoscope remains in a fixed position within the airway are the most commonly used methods. The 'piggyback method,' in which the bronchoscope is advanced toward the airway wall with the needle extended and locked in the out position, and the 'cough technique,' where the patient is instructed to cough to move the airway wall toward the locked and extended needle within the airway, are less frequently used. After the needle penetrates the airway wall, suction is applied through an attached syringe before agitating the needle back and forth within the lesion, and suction is released before withdrawing the needle into the airway to reduce aspirated bronchial tissue contamination of the specimen. Aspirated blood within the suction tubing suggests vascular puncture and the needle should be immediately retracted and introduced into a new puncture site. 94 In peripheral TBNA, the needle is advanced either directly thorough the working channel of the bronchoscope or through an extended sheath with fluoroscopic observation in a manner like TBLB. Once the outer protective sheath is within 1 to 2 cm of the lesion the needle is extended into the lesion and agitated with suction using the same technique as in central TBNA. 84",
          "omplications can occasionally develop and one must always consider the risks and benefits of the procedure. This is no better illustrated than in the tragic case of Hoiyan Wan, a healthy nursing student, who in 1996 died of lidocaine toxicity after a simple research flexible bronchoscopy. 102 Minor complications of flexible bronchoscopy and associated bronchoscopic instrumentation include laryngospasm, bronchospasm, epistaxis, transient hoarseness, fever, nausea, cough, and mild airway bleeding, and major complications include severe airway hemorrhage, pneumothorax, severe hypercapnia or hypoxia, arrhythmias, seizures, and cardiac arrest. There are no controlled studies of factors that would make a specific patient unfit for bronchoscopy, so the decision to undertake the procedure needs to be based on a combination of factors to include the potential benefit,",

Most studies report an incidence of major complications from flexible bronchoscopy of between 1% and 5%, with most major complications related to TBLB. 67-69,103,104 Mortality is rare, at less than 0.04%. 104-106",

Complications were rare with only 2 patents developing arrhythmias related to the bronchoscopy. Only 5 patients in this review were not already intubated and 1 (20%) in this subgroup required intubation after the procedure. 116 This paper does not necessarily imply that the procedure is safe, but rather that it is safer in the previously intubated and deeply sedated patient because much of the theoretic risks are associated with the underlying adrenergic response and hypoxemia attributable to bronchoscopy in the moderately sedated patient. Additionally, one should consider that the degree of adrenergic response and potential hypoxemia associated with the bronchoscopy is variable depending on the complexity of the procedure. A simple lavage in a patient who is already intubated and deeply sedated will likely result in significantly less risk than in a moderate sedation bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsies. Again, just as in patients with significant hypoxia, the risks of inducing myocardial ischemia are likely greater when lung biopsy is performed because these patients are less likely to tolerate complications such as pneumothorax or bleeding. Although the data regarding the recommendation to avoid bronchoscopy within 4 to 6 weeks of myocardial infarction are limited, it is a reasonable precaution. In a setting where bronchoscopy cannot be delayed, we recommend maximizing oxygenation, minimizing suction to avoid tachycardia and hypoxemia, and providing adequate sedation and analgesia to reduce adrenergic response with a low threshold for terminating the procedure if evidence of acute ischemia develops. Although bronchoscopy using moderate sedation is generally considered safe for patients with stable coronary artery disease, hemodynamic changes associated with the procedure may induce ischemia in rare cases. 117",
          "nhibitors before TBLB, there is a paucity of high-quality data regarding the safety of TBLB in coagulopathic or thrombocytopenic patients. The use of daily aspirin alone has been shown to have no significant increase bleeding risk in bronchoscopy, even with TBLB, and clinical guidelines recommend continuing medically necessary aspirin in the periprocedural period. 106 Although the use of aspirin alone has minimal if any increased bleeding risk, the same cannot be said for thienopyridines such as clopidogrel, especially when used in combination with aspirin. The initial animal study evaluating the effect of clopidogrel with and without aspirin before TBLB in swine showed no significant increased bleeding risk. 121 However, when clopidogrel with or without aspirin was evaluated prospectively in humans, a substantial risk was identified, with bleeding occurring in 89% of patients on clopidogrel alone and 100% of patients on combination aspirin and clopidogrel therapy. 122 Current recommendations are to hold clopidogrel for 5 to 7 days before bronchoscopic biopsies. 106 When bronchoscopy cannot be delayed, in patients with continued need for thienopyridines, such as in drug-eluding stents placed within the previous 12 months, using a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor as a bridge could be considered in consultation with interventional cardiology. 123 Data regarding TBLB in the setting of thrombocytopenia are less robust; however, the available data support caution in severe thrombocytopenia. In a small study of 24 patients with platelet counts of less than 60,000/mm 3 as a result of chemotherapeutics or bone marrow invasion from malignancy who received platelet transfusions within the hour before intervention, significant bleeding occurred in 21% of patients, with 1 patient developing fatal pulmonary hemorrhage. 124",

It is difficult to say with certainty that bronchoscopy in patients with significantly elevated ICP is safe, even with preserved cerebral perfusion pressure, because the risk of brain herniation remains. If bronchoscopy is required in a patient with severe intracranial hypertension caution is warranted and one should attempt to minimize the procedural duration while maximizing sedation to mitigate some of the hemodynamic effects.",

In this study, after the integration of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) TBNA, diagnostic yields increased for conventional TBNA performed in the station 7 and 4R lymph nodes. 86 Overall, TBNA has largely been replaced by Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) TBNA for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis, with a randomized trial showing its inferiority to Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) TBNA for diagnosing stage I and II sarcoidosis. 87 However, within the station 7 and 4R lymph nodes, conventional TBNA is still excellent with diagnostic yields comparable to that of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) TBNA. 88 Conventional TBNA remains an important tool in the sampling of endobronchial tumors, especially when the tumor is covered by mucosa or necrosis debris, which would limit the diagnostic usefulness of endobronchial forceps or brushes. 89 For the diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary lesions, TBNA has rapidly expanded in recent years largely owing to the availability of newer tools to improve localization of lesions, such as radial probe Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) imaging and electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy. 90,91 Major factors that influence diagnostic yield with peripheral TBNA include lesion size, location, and relationship to the bronchus. 92 TBNA has been shown to improve the diagnostic yield when added to standard conventional bronchoscopic techniques such as TBLB and brushing for peripheral lesions. 84,93 An advantage of TBNA over other conventional biopsy techniques is the ability to easily obtain rapid onsite cytologic evaluation, which can confirm sampling of target lesions and, if negative, prompt the bronchoscopist to modify their approach. Touch imprint cytology obtained from TBLB can also be evaluated with rapid onsite cytologic evaluation; however, cytologists are often less comfortable with this technique and data are lacking regarding the diagnostic accuracy from bronchoscopically obtained specimens. 45",
          "horter and more flexible needles, which are more easily inserted through a slightly bent working channel or guide sheath resulting in lower risk of scope damage. With central TBNA, longer stiffer needles are typically used to provide the directed force required to penetrate the airway wall. 97 When the needle is inserted into the working channel of the bronchoscope care must be taken to keep the distal tip of the bronchoscope in a neutral position to avoid scope damage. In endobronchial or parabronchial lesions, once the tip of the catheter is visible outside the bronchoscope, the needle is extended outside of the catheter and locked before puncturing the airway wall as the target site. There are 4 common methods used to penetrate the needle tip through the airway wall and into the target lesion. The 'hub against the wall' technique where the catheter is in contact with the airway wall before needle extension, and the 'jabbing technique' in which the extended needle is quickly thrust forward through the airway wall by grasping the catheter at the insertion point of the working channel while the bronchoscope remains in a fixed position within the airway are the most commonly used methods. The 'piggyback method,' in which the bronchoscope is advanced toward the airway wall with the needle extended and locked in the out position, and the 'cough technique,' where the patient is instructed to cough to move the airway wall toward the locked and extended needle within the airway, are less frequently used. After the needle penetrates the airway wall, suction is applied through an attached syringe before agitating the needle back and forth within the lesion, and suction is released before withdrawing the needle into the airway to reduce aspirated bronchial tissue contamination of the specimen. Aspirated blood within the suction tubing suggests vascular puncture and the needle should be immediately retracted and introduced into a new puncture site. 94 In peripheral TBNA, the needle is advanced either directly thorough the working channel of the bronchoscope or through an extended sheath with fluoroscopic observation in a manner like TBLB. Once the outer protective sheath is within 1 to 2 cm of the lesion the needle is extended into the lesion and agitated with suction using the same technique as in central TBNA. 84",
          "omplications can occasionally develop and one must always consider the risks and benefits of the procedure. This is no better illustrated than in the tragic case of Hoiyan Wan, a healthy nursing student, who in 1996 died of lidocaine toxicity after a simple research flexible bronchoscopy. 102 Minor complications of flexible bronchoscopy and associated bronchoscopic instrumentation include laryngospasm, bronchospasm, epistaxis, transient hoarseness, fever, nausea, cough, and mild airway bleeding, and major complications include severe airway hemorrhage, pneumothorax, severe hypercapnia or hypoxia, arrhythmias, seizures, and cardiac arrest. There are no controlled studies of factors that would make a specific patient unfit for bronchoscopy, so the decision to undertake the procedure needs to be based on a combination of factors to include the potential benefit,",
          "ikelihood of complications, patient preference, and available alternative methods of diagnosis and treatment. Most studies report an incidence of major complications from flexible bronchoscopy of between 1% and 5%, with most major complications related to TBLB. 67-69,103,104 Mortality is rare, at less than 0.04%. 104-106",
          "lexible bronchoscopy are much more frequently encountered, and the risk and benefit of the procedure must be weighed carefully.

          "ndergone bronchoscopy in the cardiac care unit. Eighty-eight percent of the patients were previously intubated and 53% had a recent myocardial infarction. Complications were rare with only 2 patents developing arrhythmias related to the bronchoscopy. Only 5 patients in this review were not already intubated and 1 (20%) in this subgroup required intubation after the procedure. 116 This paper does not necessarily imply that the procedure is safe, but rather that it is safer in the previously intubated and deeply sedated patient because much of the theoretic risks are associated with the underlying adrenergic response and hypoxemia attributable to bronchoscopy in the moderately sedated patient. Additionally, one should consider that the degree of adrenergic response and potential hypoxemia associated with the bronchoscopy is variable depending on the complexity of the procedure. A simple lavage in a patient who is already intubated and deeply sedated will likely result in significantly less risk than in a moderate sedation bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsies. Again, just as in patients with significant hypoxia, the risks of inducing myocardial ischemia are likely greater when lung biopsy is performed because these patients are less likely to tolerate complications such as pneumothorax or bleeding. Although the data regarding the recommendation to avoid bronchoscopy within 4 to 6 weeks of myocardial infarction are limited, it is a reasonable precaution. In a setting where bronchoscopy cannot be delayed, we recommend maximizing oxygenation, minimizing suction to avoid tachycardia and hypoxemia, and providing adequate sedation and analgesia to reduce adrenergic response with a low threshold for terminating the procedure if evidence of acute ischemia develops. Although bronchoscopy using moderate sedation is generally considered safe for patients with stable coronary artery disease, hemodynamic changes associated with the procedure may induce ischemia in rare cases. 117",
          "nhibitors before TBLB, there is a paucity of high-quality data regarding the safety of TBLB in coagulopathic or thrombocytopenic patients. The use of daily aspirin alone has been shown to have no significant increase bleeding risk in bronchoscopy, even with TBLB, and clinical guidelines recommend continuing medically necessary aspirin in the periprocedural period. 106 Although the use of aspirin alone has minimal if any increased bleeding risk, the same cannot be said for thienopyridines such as clopidogrel, especially when used in combination with aspirin. The initial animal study evaluating the effect of clopidogrel with and without aspirin before TBLB in swine showed no significant increased bleeding risk. 121 However, when clopidogrel with or without aspirin was evaluated prospectively in humans, a substantial risk was identified, with bleeding occurring in 89% of patients on clopidogrel alone and 100% of patients on combination aspirin and clopidogrel therapy. 122 Current recommendations are to hold clopidogrel for 5 to 7 days before bronchoscopic biopsies. 106 When bronchoscopy cannot be delayed, in patients with continued need for thienopyridines, such as in drug-eluding stents placed within the previous 12 months, using a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor as a bridge could be considered in consultation with interventional cardiology. 123 Data regarding TBLB in the setting of thrombocytopenia are less robust; however, the available data support caution in severe thrombocytopenia. In a small study of 24 patients with platelet counts of less than 60,000/mm 3 as a result of chemotherapeutics or bone marrow invasion from malignancy who received platelet transfusions within the hour before intervention, significant bleeding occurred in 21% of patients, with 1 patient developing fatal pulmonary hemorrhage. 124",

It is difficult to say with certainty that bronchoscopy in patients with significantly elevated ICP is safe, even with preserved cerebral perfusion pressure, because the risk of brain herniation remains. If bronchoscopy is required in a patient with severe intracranial hypertension caution is warranted and one should attempt to minimize the procedural duration while maximizing sedation to mitigate some of the hemodynamic effects.",
