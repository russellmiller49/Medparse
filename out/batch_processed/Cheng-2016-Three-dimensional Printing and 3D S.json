            "text": "Additive manufacturing via 3D printing has several variations (Fig 1). The most commonly available 3D printing technologies are stereolithography, SLS, fused deposition modeling, and multijet modeling. First, stereolithography (3D Systems; Formlabs) uses a laser to generate an ultraviolet beam at the surface of a pool of photosensitive resin, which leads to local polymerization of the liquid resin. The reaction platform is raised or dropped as each layer is created. This method offers high geometric accuracy but is limited by the resin material available for use (Fig 1A, Video 1). 3 Second, SLS (3D Systems) uses a high-power laser (carbon dioxide) to fuse thermoplastic powder made from plastic, metal, or ceramic. After laser fusing a cross-section, the powder bed drops down one layer thickness, and a new layer of thermoplastic powder is applied. This method allows a variety of materials to be used and affords high accuracy and resolution but at a higher cost (Fig 1B). Third, fused deposition modeling (Stratasys) uses various /uniFB01 laments (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, polylactic acid [PLA], polycarbonate,"

The printer nozzle moves in an x-y-z plane and deposits layer after layer of material that hardens after extrusion. This method provides high geometric accuracy and models that can be sterilized for use in an operative setting (Fig 1C, Video 2). Fourth, multijet modeling (Z Corporation) uses layers of /uniFB01 ne powder (plaster or resin) that is bonded by water-based adhesive. This method allows full-color prototyping but at the sacri /uniFB01 ce of geometric accuracy and mechanical strength (Fig 1D). 2"

These medical polymers can be used alone or blended to achieve desired properties. PCL has a long history of medical applications attributed to its low melting temperature of approximately 60 /C14 C, low glass transition temperature of /C0 60 /C14 C, and high thermal stability. PCL has been used in both fusion deposition modeling and SLS printers for manufacturing of biological scaffolds for tissue engineering. 4,5 Initially synthesized in the 1920s, PLA is biodegradable thermoplastic aliphatic polyester derived from renewable resources such as corn, sugarcane, roots, or starch. This versatile bioplastic degrades into lactic acid and has been used for implantable screws, mesh, rods, and scaffolds for bone regeneration. 6 PLGA is a copolymer of PLA and polyglycolic acid that is biocompatible and biodegradable and exhibits broad erosion times with modi /uniFB01 able mechanical properties. Depending on the blending ratio of PLA and polyglycolic acid, the resulting PLGA copolymer has very different mechanical properties and degradation pro /uniFB01 les.

According to the Center for Disease Control ' s Guideline for Disinfection and Sterilization in Healthcare Facilities, 22 four sterilization techniques are commonly used to sterilize medical equipment: autoclave, ethylene oxide gas, hydrogen peroxide gas plasma, and gamma radiation. The autoclave uses direct contact with steam at high temperature (121 /C14 C or 132 /C14 C) and pressure for a minimal amount of time. Although this approach is nontoxic, most 3D printable materials cannot withstand the high temperature, so low temperature ( < 60 /C14 C) approaches are desirable. Ethylene oxide gas is a microbicidal gas that inhibits cellular metabolism and replication via alkylation of protein, DNA, and RNA. Hydrogen peroxide gas plasma and gamma radiation can also be used to sterilize 3D printed material leaving little to no toxic residue. 22"

After downloading and installing 3D Slicer, the user will need to install the extension for airway segmentation. 3D Slicer will have to be restarted for the extension to take effect. The user will then need to load the CT scan and select the airway segmentation module. Once in airway segmentation, /uniFB01 ducials (or seeds) must be placed within the trachea and right and left bronchi, which will serve as the start of airway modeling. Once the digital model of the airway has been generated, the user can then save the /uniFB01 le into .STL format, which can then be sent to a 3D printer for printing (Fig 3). Using the 3D Slicer airway segmentation algorithm, one can generate a physical 3D printed airway model. This model can then be used for preprocedural planning. The digital model generated from 3D Slicer can be imported into a variety of types of digital modeling software that allow further manipulation of the digital airway model (Fig 4; e-Appendix 1)."

Improved imaging with computerised tomography (CT) has been followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and, more recently, it has become possible to reformat the data as three-dimensional images. Computer technology has new moved forward with the advent of rapid prototyping techniques (RPT) which allow both the production of models of the hard tissues and custom-made prostheses from computerised scanning data. In this article we review the development and current technologies available in RPT and the applications of this advance in surgery and illustrate this with two case reports."

Current 2-dimensional imaging techniques remain limited both in their ability to represent the complex 3-dimensional relationships present in structural heart disease and in their capacity to adequately facilitate often complex corrective procedures. This review discusses the cardiovascular applications of rapid prototyping, a new technology that may not only play a significant role in the planning of catheter-based interventions but also may serve as a valuable educational tool to enhance the medical community's understanding of the many forms of structural heart disease."

        "abstract": "Fused deposition modelling (FDM) is an extrusion based Rapid prototyping (RP) technique which can be used to fabricate tissue engineering scaffolds. The present work focuses on the study of the melt flow behaviour (MFB) of Poly-epsilon-caprolactone (PCL) as a representative biomaterial, on the FDM. The MFB significantly affects the quality of the scaffold which depends not only on the pressure gradient, its velocity, and the temperature gradients but also physical properties like the melt temperature and rheology. The MFB is studied using two methods: mathematical modelling and finite element analysis (FEA) using Ansys(R). The MFB is studied using accurate channel geometry by varying filament velocity at the entry and by varying nozzle diameters and angles at the exit. The comparative results of both mathematical modelling and FEA suggest that the pressure drop and the velocities of the melt flow depend on the flow channel parameters. One inference of particular interest is the temperature gradient of the PCL melt, which shows that it liquefies within 35% of the channel length. These results are invaluable to better understand the MFB of biomaterials that affects the quality of the scaffold built via FDM and can also be used to predict the MFB of other biomaterials."

        "abstract": "Rapid prototyping (RP), also known as additive manufacturing (AM), has been well received and adopted in the biomedical field. The capacity of this family of techniques to fabricate customized 3D structures with complex geometries and excellent reproducibility has revolutionized implantology and regenerative medicine. In particular, nozzle-based systems allow the fabrication of high-resolution polylactic acid (PLA) structures that are of interest in regenerative medicine. These 3D structures find interesting applications in the regenerative medicine field where promising applications including biodegradable templates for tissue regeneration purposes, 3D in vitro platforms for studying cell response to different scaffolds conditions and for drug screening are considered among others. Scaffolds functionality depends not only on the fabrication technique, but also on the material used to build the 3D structure, the geometry and inner architecture of the structure, and the final surface properties. All being crucial parameters affecting scaffolds success. This Commentary emphasizes the importance of these parameters in scaffolds' fabrication and also draws the attention toward the versatility of these PLA scaffolds as a potential tool in regenerative medicine and other medical fields."

        "abstract": "The large surface area, good vascularization, immense capacity for solute exchange and ultra-thinness of the alveolar epithelium are unique features of the lung facilitating systemic drug delivery via pulmonary administration. The efficacy and safety of many new and existing inhaled therapies may be enhanced through advanced controlled-release systems by using polymer particles. Poly (D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) is well known by its safety in biomedical preparations which has been approved for human use by the FDA. The optimum aerodynamic particle size distribution for most inhalation aerosols has generally been recognized to be in the range of 1-5 microns. PLGA microspheres, therefore, were prepared by a developed oil-in-oil solvent evaporation method and characterized. A four-factor, three levels Box-Behnken design was used for the optimization procedure with temperature, stirring speed, PLGA and surfactant concentration as independent variables. Particle size and polydispersity of microspheres were considered as dependent variables. PLGA microparticles were prepared successfully in desired size for pulmonary delivery by solvent evaporation method. It was found that the particle size of microspheres could be easily controlled. It was also proved that response surface methodology could efficiently be applied for size characterization and optimization of PLGA microparticles for pulmonary drug delivery."

        "abstract": "3D Printing promises to produce complex biomedical devices according to computer design using patient-specific anatomical data. Since its initial use as pre-surgical visualization models and tooling molds, 3D Printing has slowly evolved to create one-of-a-kind devices, implants, scaffolds for tissue engineering, diagnostic platforms, and drug delivery systems. Fueled by the recent explosion in public interest and access to affordable printers, there is renewed interest to combine stem cells with custom 3D scaffolds for personalized regenerative medicine. Before 3D Printing can be used routinely for the regeneration of complex tissues (e.g. bone, cartilage, muscles, vessels, nerves in the craniomaxillofacial complex), and complex organs with intricate 3D microarchitecture (e.g. liver, lymphoid organs), several technological limitations must be addressed. In this review, the major materials and technology advances within the last five years for each of the common 3D Printing technologies (Three Dimensional Printing, Fused Deposition Modeling, Selective Laser Sintering, Stereolithography, and 3D Plotting/Direct-Write/Bioprinting) are described. Examples are highlighted to illustrate progress of each technology in tissue engineering, and key limitations are identified to motivate future research and advance this fascinating field of advanced manufacturing."

A prospective trial with the objective of assessing the utility of biomodelling in complex surgery has been performed. Forty-five patients with craniofacial, maxillofacial, skull base cervical spinal pathology were selected. 3-D CT or MR scanning was performed and the data of interest were edited and converted into a form acceptable to the rapid prototyping technology SL. The data were used to guide a laser to selectively polymerize photosensitive resin to manufacture biomodels. The biomodels were used by surgeons for patient education, diagnosis and operative planning. An assessment protocol was used to test the hypothesis that 'biomodels in addition to standard imaging had greater utility in the surgery performed than the standard imaging alone'. Biomodels significantly improved operative planning (images 44.09%, images with biomodel 82.21%, P &lt; .01) and diagnosis (images 65.63%, images with biomodel 95.23%, P &lt; .01). Biomodels were found to improve measurement accuracy significantly (image measurement error 44.14%, biomodel measurement error 7.91%, P &lt; .05). Surgeons estimated that the use of biomodels reduced operating time by a mean of 17.63% and were cost effective at a mean price of $1031 AUS. Patients found the biomodels to be helpful for informed consent (images 63.53%, biomodels 88.54%, P &lt; .001). Biomodelling is an intuitive, user-friendly technology that facilitated diagnosis and operative planning. Biomodels allowed surgeons to rehearse procedures readily and improved communication between colleagues and patients."

Instead of milling the implants from a titanium block, an advanced method of rapid prototyping for a fine casting process is presented. Casting vs milling offers several advantages. It is possible to form very thinly tapered structures and to obtain more complex geometrical structures with smaller diameters. Many geometrical forms, which cannot be milled for technical reasons, can be produced using this technique."

The radiographs, CT scans, and models each were graded according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgery (AAOS) classification for acetabular deficiency. The classifications for the radiographs, CT scans, and models were then compared with findings at surgery. The models predicted acetabular deformity and AAOS classification significantly better than the other imaging modalities. The models agreed with the surgical findings in 9 of 10 cases, compared with 2 of 10 for the CT scans (P = .016) and 4 of 10 for the plain radiographs (P = .063). The models closely predicted the available space for the hemispheric acetabular shells, based on the size of the last reamer used, for the 6 hips reconstructed with standard components. Four patients required custom acetabular components; in 2 of those 4, the need for custom components was not anticipated by plain radiographs or CT scans. Three-dimensional CT-generated acetabular models were found to be useful in preoperative planning of complex acetabular reconstructions."

        "abstract": "Advances in scaffold design and fabrication technology have brought the tissue engineering field stepping into a new era. Conventional techniques used to develop scaffolds inherit limitations, such as lack of control over the pore morphology and architecture as well as reproducibility. Rapid prototyping (RP) technology, a layer-by-layer additive approach offers a unique opportunity to build complex 3D architectures overcoming those limitations that could ultimately be tailored to cater for patient-specific applications. Using RP methods, researchers have been able to customize scaffolds to mimic the biomechanical properties (in terms of structural integrity, strength, and microenvironment) of the organ or tissue to be repaired/replaced quite closely. This article provides intensive description on various extrusion based scaffold fabrication techniques and review their potential utility for TE applications. The extrusion-based technique extrudes the molten polymer as a thin filament through a nozzle onto a platform layer-by-layer and thus building 3D scaffold. The technique allows full control over pore architecture and dimension in the x- and y- planes. However, the pore height in z-direction is predetermined by the extruding nozzle diameter rather than the technique itself. This review attempts to assess the current state and future prospects of this technology."

        "abstract": "Several recent research efforts have focused on use of computer-aided additive fabrication technologies, commonly referred to as additive manufacturing, rapid prototyping, solid freeform fabrication, or three-dimensional printing technologies, to create structures for tissue engineering. For example, scaffolds for tissue engineering may be processed using rapid prototyping technologies, which serve as matrices for cell ingrowth, vascularization, as well as transport of nutrients and waste. Stereolithography is a photopolymerization-based rapid prototyping technology that involves computer-driven and spatially controlled irradiation of liquid resin. This technology enables structures with precise microscale features to be prepared directly from a computer model. In this review, use of stereolithography for processing trimethylene carbonate, polycaprolactone, and poly(D,L-lactide) poly(propylene fumarate)-based materials is considered. In addition, incorporation of bioceramic fillers for fabrication of bioceramic scaffolds is reviewed. Use of stereolithography for processing of patient-specific implantable scaffolds is also discussed. In addition, use of photopolymerization-based rapid prototyping technology, known as two-photon polymerization, for production of tissue engineering scaffolds with smaller features than conventional stereolithography technology is considered."

Here, we demonstrate the potential of 3D bioprinting for tissue engineering using human skin as a prototypical example. Keratinocytes and fibroblasts were used as constituent cells to represent the epidermis and dermis, and collagen was used to represent the dermal matrix of the skin. Preliminary studies were conducted to optimize printing parameters for maximum cell viability as well as for the optimization of cell densities in the epidermis and dermis to mimic physiologically relevant attributes of human skin. Printed 3D constructs were cultured in submerged media conditions followed by exposure of the epidermal layer to the air-liquid interface to promote maturation and stratification. Histology and immunofluorescence characterization demonstrated that 3D printed skin tissue was morphologically and biologically representative of in vivo human skin tissue. In comparison with traditional methods for skin engineering, 3D bioprinting offers several advantages in terms of shape- and form retention, flexibility, reproducibility, and high culture throughput. It has a broad range of applications in transdermal and topical formulation discovery, dermal toxicity studies, and in designing autologous grafts for wound healing. The proof-of-concept studies presented here can be further extended for enhancing the complexity of the skin model via the incorporation of secondary and adnexal structures or the inclusion of diseased cells to serve as a model for studying the pathophysiology of skin diseases."

Intraluminally growing tumors can be resected with laser, argon-plasma coagulation, an electrosurgical knife or cryo-probe. Photodynamic therapy of smaller tracheal tumors can be curative. Narrowing from intramural tumor growth or wall destruction requires internal splinting with an airway stent. Scar strictures can be dilated with balloons but the biotrauma may stimulate new scarring. In benign strictures and malacias, tracheal stents should only be placed if all other methods are exhausted. Complications including stent migration, mucostasis, halitosis and granulation tissue development must be considered. Most important for a good outcome is a multidisciplinary approach."

The advent of 3D-printable biomaterials has created the potential for device control in the fourth dimension: 3D-printed objects that exhibit a designed shape change under tissue growth and resorption conditions over time. Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) is a condition of excessive collapse of the airways during respiration that can lead to life-threatening cardiopulmonary arrests. We demonstrate the successful application of 3D printing technology to produce a personalized medical device for treatment of TBM, designed to accommodate airway growth while preventing external compression over a predetermined time period before bioresorption. We implanted patient-specific 3D-printed external airway splints in three infants with severe TBM. At the time of publication, these infants no longer exhibited life-threatening airway disease and had demonstrated resolution of both pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications of their TBM. Long-term data show continued growth of the primary airways. This process has broad application for medical manufacturing of patient-specific 3D-printed devices that adjust to tissue growth through designed mechanical and degradation behaviors over time."

        "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) printing, or additive manufacturing, technology has rapidly penetrated the medical device industry over the past several years, and innovative groups have harnessed it to create devices with unique composition, structure, and customizability. These distinctive capabilities afforded by 3D printing have introduced new regulatory challenges. The customizability of 3D-printed devices introduces new complexities when drafting a design control model for FDA consideration of market approval. The customizability and unique build processes of 3D-printed medical devices pose unique challenges in meeting regulatory standards related to the manufacturing quality assurance. Consistent material powder properties and optimal printing parameters such as build orientation and laser power must be addressed and communicated to the FDA to ensure a quality build. Postprinting considerations unique to 3D-printed devices, such as cleaning, finishing and sterilization are also discussed. In this manuscript we illustrate how such regulatory hurdles can be navigated by discussing our experience with our group's 3D-printed bioresorbable implantable device."

        "abstract": "The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between lung function and kurtosis or skewness of lung density histograms on computed tomography (CT) in smokers. Forty-six smokers (age range 46?81 years), enrolled in the Lung Tissue Research Consortium, underwent pulmonary function tests (PFT) and chest CT at full inspiration and full expiration. On both inspiratory and expiratory scans, kurtosis and skewness of the density histograms were automatically measured by open-source software. Correlations between CT measurements and lung function were evaluated by the linear regression analysis. Although no significant correlations were found between inspiratory kurtosis or skewness and PFT results, expiratory kurtosis significantly correlated with the following: the percentage of predicted value of forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV(1)), the ratio of FEV(1) to forced vital capacity (FVC), and the ratio of residual volume (RV) to total lung capacity (TLC) (FEV(1)%predicted, R = -0.581, p &lt; 0.001; FEV(1)/FVC, R = -0.612, p &lt; 0.001; RV/TLC, R = 0.613, p &lt; 0.001, respectively). Similarly, expiratory skewness showed significant correlations with PFT results (FEV(1)%predicted, R = -0.584, p &lt; 0.001; FEV(1)/FVC, R = -0.619, p &lt; 0.001; RV/TLC, R = 0.585, p &lt; 0.001, respectively). Also, the expiratory/inspiratory (E/I) ratios of kurtosis and skewness significantly correlated with FEV(1)%predicted (p &lt; 0.001), FEV(1)/FVC (p &lt; 0.001), RV/TLC (p &lt; 0.001), and the percentage of predicted value of diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (kurtosis E/I ratio, p = 0.001; skewness E/I ratio, p = 0.03, respectively). We conclude therefore that expiratory values and the E/I ratios of kurtosis and skewness of CT densitometry reflect airflow limitation and air-trapping. Higher kurtosis or skewness on expiratory CT scan indicates more severe conditions in smokers."

For objects that are of a dimension similar to the scanner point spread function, CT will underestimate true structure density. Prior investigation suggests that this process, termed contrast reduction, could be used to estimate the strength of thin structures, such as cortical bone. In this investigation, we endeavored to exploit this process to provide a CT-based measure of airway disease that can assess changes in airway wall thickening and density that may be associated with the mural remodeling process in subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). An initial computer-based study using a range of simulated airway wall sizes and densities suggested that CT measures of airway wall attenuation could detect changes in both wall thickness and structure density. A second phantom-based study was performed using a series of polycarbonate tubes of known density. The results of this again demonstrated the process of contrast reduction and further validated the computer-based simulation. Finally, measures of airway wall attenuation, wall thickness, and wall area (WA) divided by total cross-sectional area, WA percent (WA%), were performed in a cohort of 224 subjects with COPD and correlated with spirometric measures of lung function. The results of this analysis demonstrated that wall attenuation is comparable to WA% in predicting lung function on univariate correlation and remain as a statistically significant correlate to the percent forced expiratory volume in 1 s predicted when adjusted for measures of both emphysema and WA%. These latter findings suggest that the quantitative assessment of airway wall attenuation may offer complementary information to WA% in characterizing airway disease in subjects with COPD."

In this study we assessed the clinical relevance of a semiautomatic computed tomography (CT)-based segmentation method using the competitive region-growing based algorithm, implemented in the free and public available 3D-Slicer software platform. We compared the 3D-Slicer segmented volumes by three independent observers, who segmented the primary tumour of 20 NSCLC patients twice, to manual slice-by-slice delineations of five physicians. Furthermore, we compared all tumour contours to the macroscopic diameter of the tumour in pathology, considered as the \"gold standard\". The 3D-Slicer segmented volumes demonstrated high agreement (overlap fractions &gt; 0.90), lower volume variability (p = 0.0003) and smaller uncertainty areas (p = 0.0002), compared to manual slice-by-slice delineations. Furthermore, 3D-Slicer segmentations showed a strong correlation to pathology (r = 0.89, 95%CI, 0.81-0.94). Our results show that semiautomatic 3D-Slicer segmentations can be used for accurate contouring and are more stable than manual delineations. Therefore, 3D-Slicer can be employed as a starting point for treatment decisions or for high-throughput data mining research, such as Radiomics, where manual delineating often represent a time-consuming bottleneck."

In some conditions, having an airway segmentation method which facilitates reconstruction of the airway from chest CT images can help hugely in the assessment of lung diseases. Many efforts have been made to develop airway segmentation algorithms, but methods are usually not optimized to be reliable across different CT scan parameters."

Despite the increased adoption of rapid prototyping and additive manufacturing techniques in the health-care /uniFB01 eld, many physicians lack the technical skill set to use this exciting and useful technology. Additionally, the growth in the 3D printing sector brings an ever-increasing number of 3D printers and printable materials. Therefore, it is important for clinicians to keep abreast of this rapidly developing /uniFB01 eld in order to bene /uniFB01 t. In this Ahead of the Curve , we review the history of 3D printing from its inception to the most recent biomedical applications. Additionally, we will address some of the major barriers to wider adoption of the technology in the medical /uniFB01 eld. Finally, we will provide an initial guide to 3D modeling and printing by demonstrating how to design a personalized airway prosthesis via 3D Slicer. We hope this information will reduce the barriers to use and increase clinician participation in the 3D printing health-care sector. CHEST 2016; 149(5):1136-1142"

The printer nozzle moves in an x-y-z plane and deposits layer after layer of material that hardens after extrusion. This method provides high geometric accuracy and models that can be sterilized for use in an operative setting (Fig 1C, Video 2). Fourth, multijet modeling (Z Corporation) uses layers of /uniFB01 ne powder (plaster or resin) that is bonded by water-based adhesive. This method allows full-color prototyping but at the sacri /uniFB01 ce of geometric accuracy and mechanical strength (Fig 1D). 2",

The Chest Imaging Platform offers a collection of tools for the preprocessing of lung images as well as user modules for disease-speci /uniFB01 c quanti /uniFB01 cation tasks. 34 The by-products of these quanti /uniFB01 cation tasks are digital models of various lung structures that could be used for 3D printing operations (Fig 2, Video 3). For example, the lobar and airway anatomy can be extracted and converted into 3D models for printing. In order to achieve a high/uniFB01 delity 3D reconstruction, it would be ideal to use high-resolution CT scans. However, 3D Slicer is capable of using Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine data from low-dose CT scans and is still able to construct acceptable models.",

As a disruptive technology in manufacturing and design, 3D printing has the potential to change the landscape of medicine. Increasingly, institutions are recognizing this potential and are actively creating institutional innovation centers and pursuing a close collaboration with industry leaders such as Stratasys and 3D Systems. These efforts will secure the continued use of 3D design and printing in everyday medicine."
