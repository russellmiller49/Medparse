One of the primary drivers of the revenue for this procedure was reimbursement based on the diagnosis-related group that is determined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The diagnosis-related group for BLVR is that of major chest procedures, which is also used for surgical procedures such as lobectomy. In addition to the procedure and inpatient stay, a comprehensive workup was needed for all patients referred for BLVR to determine candidacy. This workup included clinic visits, pulmonary function tests, and imaging. Outpatient bronchoscopies were sometimes performed as part of the initial workup when necessary to exclude infections and diagnose suspicious nodules. In our analysis, we found that the estimated revenue exceeded the projected revenue. It is important to note that the revenue was a conservative estimate based on negotiated Medicare reimbursement rates. Furthermore, some patients had imaging studies and pulmonary function tests done at outside institutions. These tests were not included in our revenue calculation because they did not generate revenue within our medical center. In institutions where all workup is performed in one medical center, this would generate more revenue."

Correlating this metric to EBV placement is not straightforward because the revenue and cost is from the procedure plus the subsequent hospitalization, and both hospital and physician reimbursement are analyzed. Additionally, cost accounting is typically not performed at the procedure and hospitalization level but rather at the aggregate level, as is the case at our center. We therefore used the CCR to estimate costs, a method used previously in health care cost analysis. 14-17 This method may even overestimate costs slightly, which would make our margin estimate even stronger. 18 We acknowledge that cost accounting at the procedure and hospitalization level may provide a more direct measure of cost. However, CCR is a reasonable and reliable method by which to estimate costs because we are analyzing historical data. The CCR for our institution was stable over the 4 years of our data analysis, adding to its reliability. Our favorable margin is sustainable and promotes further growth for the medical center and the IP program to continue care for the patients."

        "abstract": "Over the last decade, endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) evolved into a validated and powerful diagnostic tool. Although it is integral to medical care in some health-care systems, others struggle to justify its purchase based on diminishing reimbursement. In analyzing its value to a health-care system, looking at procedural reimbursement alone will grossly underestimate its economic impact. Downstream revenue has been defined by administrators as revenue captured after patients use one hospital service and then use others. By analyzing consecutive EBUS cases and taking downstream revenue into account, $2.4 million in collections was attributed to 97 patients who were newly referred for this procedure."

        "abstract": "Interventional pulmonology programs provide clinical benefit to patients and are financially sustainable. To appreciate and illustrate the economic value of interventional pulmonology programs to hospital systems, physicians must have an understanding of basic health-care finance. Total revenue, adjusted gross revenue, contribution margin, variable direct costs, and indirect costs are terms that are essential for understanding the finances of bronchoscopy. Command of such vocabulary and its application is crucial for interventional pulmonologists to successfully establish financially sustainable bronchoscopy programs. Two significant features of an economically sustainable bronchoscopy program are high procedural volume and low direct cost per case. Interventional pulmonology programs are valuable to the patients being served and hospitals as a whole. Consideration of the various factors needed to maintain financial sustainability is essential to improve the quality of care for patients because the cost of care remains a critical driver in defining value."

Secondary effectiveness outcomes included: difference in FEV<sub>1</sub> responder rates, target lobe volume reduction, hyperinflation, health status, dyspnea, and exercise capacity. The primary safety outcome was the incidence of composite thoracic serious adverse events. All analyses were conducted by determining the 95% Bayesian credible intervals (BCIs) for the difference between treatment and control arms. Between October 2013 and May 2017, 172 participants (53.5% male; mean age, 67.4 yr) were randomized to treatment (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;113) or control (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;59). Mean FEV<sub>1</sub> showed statistically significant improvements between the treatment and control groups-between-group difference at 6 and 12 months, respectively, of 0.101 L (95% BCI, 0.060-0.141) and 0.099 L (95% BCI, 0.048-0.151). At 6 months, the treatment group had statistically significant improvements in all secondary endpoints except 6-minute-walk distance. Composite thoracic serious adverse event incidence through 6 months was greater in the treatment group (31.0% vs. 11.9%), primarily due to a 12.4% incidence of serious pneumothorax.<b>Conclusions:</b> In patients with severe heterogeneous emphysema, the SVS shows significant improvement in multiple efficacy outcomes, with an acceptable safety profile.Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01812447)."

Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (BLVR) using endobronchial valves to target unilateral lobar occlusion can improve lung function and exercise capacity in patients with emphysema. The benefit is most pronounced in, though not confined to, patients where lobar atelectasis has occurred. Few data exist on their long-term outcome. 19 patients (16 males; mean&#xb1;sd forced expiratory volume in 1 s 28.4&#xb1;11.9% predicted) underwent BLVR between July 2002 and February 2004. Radiological atelectasis was observed in five patients. Survival data was available for all patients up to February 2010. None of the patients in whom atelectasis occurred died during follow-up, whereas eight out of 14 in the nonatelectasis group died (Chi-squared p=0.026). There was no significant difference between the groups at baseline in lung function, quality of life, exacerbation rate, exercise capacity (shuttle walk test or cycle ergometry) or computed tomography appearances, although body mass index was significantly higher in the atelectasis group (21.6&#xb1;2.9 versus 28.4&#xb1;2.9 kg&#xb7;m(-2); p&lt;0.001). The data in the present study suggest that atelectasis following BLVR is associated with a survival benefit that is not explained by baseline differences."

We discuss key strategies to evaluate and improve efficiency in interventional pulmonology practice and describe our experience in developing an interventional pulmonology suite. Such a model can be adapted to other specialty areas and may encourage a more coordinated approach to specialty care."

One of the primary drivers of the revenue for this procedure was reimbursement based on the diagnosis-related group that is determined by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The diagnosis-related group for BLVR is that of major chest procedures, which is also used for surgical procedures such as lobectomy. In addition to the procedure and inpatient stay, a comprehensive workup was needed for all patients referred for BLVR to determine candidacy. This workup included clinic visits, pulmonary function tests, and imaging. Outpatient bronchoscopies were sometimes performed as part of the initial workup when necessary to exclude infections and diagnose suspicious nodules. In our analysis, we found that the estimated revenue exceeded the projected revenue. It is important to note that the revenue was a conservative estimate based on negotiated Medicare reimbursement rates. Furthermore, some patients had imaging studies and pulmonary function tests done at outside institutions. These tests were not included in our revenue calculation because they did not generate revenue within our medical center.

Because these tests are required for assessment of BLVR candidacy, such testing would need to be performed.
