His airway was severely compromised from a suspected case of bacterial epiglottitis. In only the year prior, the medical literature described a surgical technique allowing access to the trachea in cases of upper airway obstruction. However, as Washington lay gasping for air, a team of his closest and most trusted physicians decided against tracheotomy (a procedure considered highly experimental and radical at the time) and opted instead for bloodletting, removing 80 oz (2365 mL) of blood over",

Dr Jackson's approach was thought to have reduced the mortality associated with tracheotomy from 25% to 1%. 1 With the increased use of mechanical ventilation in the mid-twentieth century and the decreased mortality of the procedure, the practice of using tracheostomy tubes for prolonged ventilatory support became more routine and widespread. 4 In 1955, the physician, C. Hunter Shelden, and colleagues 5 described a percutaneous method for tracheostomy tube placement as an alternative to the surgical approach. Twelve years later, Toye and Weinstein used the Seldinger guidewire to improve its safety 1 ; in 1985, Pasquale Ciaglia and colleagues 6 further refined the procedure, leading to what is considered the most popular and widely applied technique today for percutaneous dilational tracheostomy (PDT)."

Therefore, the decreased length of tracheostomy tubes and removable inner cannula (which allows for evacuation of secretions) is thought to result in decreased airflow resistance. In addition to changes in airflow, the ease with which a tracheostomy tube can be removed and reconnected to the ventilator has been theorized to result in more aggressive weaning attempts. 7",

The first 48 hours after placement is considered a 'dangerous period' for tube change, and 'changes should not be undertaken without adequate emergency equipment and illumination similar to that available for the initial procedure.' 52 The risk of airway loss during tracheostomy tube exchanges can be minimized by delaying the procedure if there are factors that prolong tract immaturity (ie, steroid use, poor wound healing), keeping a smaller tracheostomy tube at the bedside, and considering the use of an exchange catheter or bronchoscope in higher-risk cases. 50 If the tracheostomy tube completely dislodges within the first week following placement, some algorithms call for orotracheal intubation with cuff placed distal to the stoma. 47,53 After the airway is secured, the stoma can be redilated and the tube replaced in a controlled setting."

Tracheostomy tubes can be inserted surgically or percutaneously. Tracheostomy is performed for upper airway obstruction, though more often to allow prolonged mechanical ventilation in place of ETTs. A major benefit over ETT ventilation includes improved comfort and mobility. The timing of the tracheostomy is controversial; however, many centers recommend consideration after 10 to 14 days of intubation in patients expected to remain ventilator dependent. Preparation, performance, and postoperative management for PDT are best provided by a multidisciplinary team. Although PDT is a safe procedure in the hands of experienced operators, both early and late complications can arise. A major, albeit rare, complication is TIF. TIF requires early recognition"

This new technique consists of inserting a tracheostomy tube by the use of a J guide wire inserted through a cannula into the tracheal lumen. Tapered dilators follow the guide wire and dilate the opening in the tracheal walls. A tracheostomy tube snugly fitted over a dilator is then passed into the trachea between the cricoid cartilage and the first tracheal ring. This procedure avoids the immediate and postoperative complications of \"standard\" tracheostomy. An experience of 134 tracheostomies of various types culminated in the development of the percutaneous technique. To date 26 such operations on 24 patients have been done with no significant complications due to the operation. The percutaneous technique should reduce the severity and incidence of intraoperative complications. Late complications, which have been no problem to date, are being evaluated with longer follow-up and with a greater patient population."

This is a case series of 9 patients who presented over a 58-month period. All patients were in severe respiratory difficulty where intubation by conventional means was unsuccessful. All 9 patients were successfully intubated using PDT technique. No technical complications were noted, specifically bleeding, extratracheal placement, or prolonged procedure time. Six patients ultimately died, 2 from anoxic encephalopathy due to failed resuscitation and 4 from comorbid illness. Three patients ultimately survived to hospital discharge. The authors conclude that PDT can effectively establish a surgical airway in an emergent setting. The major advantage of this technique is the ability to gain and maintain competence in an elective, controlled environment. The authors believe that PDT may play a role in the management of the emergent surgical airway."

Appropriate application of tracheotomy requires a skilled approach for timing the procedure, selecting the appropriate tracheostomy tube appliance, caring for the artificial airway once it is in place, and assisting patients with their specialized needs, such as articulated speech, airway humidification, and oral nutrition. Preparing patients for airway decannulation after they have weaned from mechanical ventilation requires a similar level of skill and attention to detail."

Traditionally passed on in the apprenticeship model, dedicated fellowships began in the early 2000s and there are currently approximately 24 IP fellowships throughout the United States. In addition to the evaluation and management of patients with the above diseases, the additional year provides training in advanced diagnostic and minimally invasive therapeutic procedures that are not specifically taught during a standard PCCM fellowship. This article will review the evolution of the field of IP as well as the pathways to learn advanced procedural techniques."

Several variants have been developed in the years with a convincing evidence that, compared to surgical tracheostomy, the percutaneous approach is more cost-effective without compromising safety. However the procedure is not immune from complications and requires procedural skills and adequate level of expertise with a steep learning curve. In this contest, to optimize safety and efficacy of percutaneous tracheostomy in different clinical scenarios, physicians should be familiar with the different available percutaneous techniques. Traditionally, the training has been performed using manikins or animal models. However, by definition the manikin is not able to replicate the complex anatomy and does not provide a realist model for learning."

In the last 10 years, formal IP fellowships have increased substantially in number from five to now &gt; 30. The vast majority of IP fellowship trainees are selected through the National Resident Matching Program, and validated in-service and certification examinations for IP exist. Practice standards and training guidelines for IP fellowship programs have been published; however, considerable variability in the environment, curriculum, and experience offered by the various fellowship programs remains, and there is currently no formal accreditation process in place to standardize IP fellowship training. Recognizing the need for more uniform training across the various fellowship programs, a multisociety accreditation committee was formed with the intent to establish common accreditation standards for all IP fellowship programs in the United States. This article provides a summary of those standards and can serve as an accreditation template for training programs and their offices of graduate medical education as they move through the accreditation process."

        "abstract": "Tracheostomy is a common surgical procedure performed in long-term ventilated patients in intensive care. Since the role of percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) on Intensive Care Unit (ICU) has become steadily more important in the last few years, a prospective study was started to evaluate the economic efficiency and to show the minimization of the complication rate of this procedure. In 72 patients we performed PDT as a bedside procedure. Initially the thyroid gland and the subcutaneous vessels were studied by ultrasound in every patient. The puncture of the trachea, the dilatational procedure and the insertion of the tracheal cannula were executed under bronchoscopic monitoring. Finally, a bronchoscopic control view followed via the new cannula to detect intratracheal complications. Mechanical ventilation was maintained during the procedure and controlled by continuous pulse oximetry. According to prior ultrasound findings the place to puncture the trachea was changed in 24% of the patients, in one case tracheostomy was performed as an open conventional procedure. The following complications could be observed: one case involving perforation of a cartilaginous ring, one case with venous bleeding of a small subcutaneous vein and two cases with punctures of the bronchoscope. There were no cases of miscannulation, penetration of the posterior tracheal wall or major bleeding requiring intervention or conversion. The followup study revealed that there was no sign of further complications in any patient. In addition, cost analysis demonstrated that there was a significant economical advantage of PDT in comparison with open standard tracheostomy. Standardized ultrasonographically and bronchoscopically controlled PDT turns out to be a safe, simple and cost effective bedside procedure on ICU. Because of ultrasound examination performed before the procedure, and bronchoscopic surveillance during the procedure, safety of this procedure can be enhanced, thus minimizing the rate of complications."

Upper airway obstructions, failure to liberate from the ventilator, and debilitating neurological conditions are only a few indications for tracheostomy tube placement. Tracheostomy tubes can be placed either surgically or percutaneously. A percutaneous approach offers fewer surgical site infections and postsurgical bleeding than a surgical approach. A surgical placement posses a lower risk of injury to the posterior tracheal wall and spontaneous decannulation is less common. Late complications of both approaches include stenosis, malacia, along with tracheoesophageal, tracheoinnominate, and tracheocutaneous fistulas. This review describes the indications and methods of placement of tracheostomy tubes along with early and late complications that may occur following placement."

As new techniques such as PDT are introduced, we must investigate their utility compared with the current standard of care in the most rigorous fashion. Additionally, as many of the complications of ETI can lead to increases in morbidity and mortality, prompt diagnosis and management are essential."

Low pressure cuffs, however, may easily be overinflated to yield pressures that will exceed capillary perfusion pressure. Various large volume cuffed endotracheal tubes were studied, including Portex Profile, Searle Sensiv, Mallinkrodt Hi-Lo, and Lanz. Tracheal mucosal blood flow in 40 patients undergoing surgery was assessed using an endoscopic photographic technique while varying the cuff inflation pressure. It was found that these cuffs when overpressurised impaired mucosal blood flow. This impairment of tracheal mucosal blood flow is an important factor in tracheal morbidity associated with intubation. Hence it is recommended that a cuff inflation pressure of 30 cm H2O (22 mm Hg) should not be exceeded."

This study also found no difference in median intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, hospital length of stay, or duration of mechanical ventilation. There was a decreased use of sedation in the early arm; however, there were significantly fewer tracheostomies performed in the late cohort, thus, highlighting the clinician's inability to accurately predict which patients will require prolonged mechanical ventilation. The lead investigator has summarized the results stating, 'if you had 100 patients requiring tracheostomy, doing it early results in 2.4 days less sedation overall, but you would perform 48 more, with 3 more procedural complications and no effect on mortality or ICU length of stay'. 17",

A J-tipped guidewire is advanced through the needle into the airway ( Fig. 6 C, D) and the needle is removed. The tract is first dilated with a short 14F dilating catheter ( Fig. 7 A, B) followed by a single tapered dilator ( Fig. 7 C, D). The tracheostomy tube is inserted on a separate obturator over the guidewire, and the cuff is inflated inside the trachea ( Fig. 8 ). The bronchoscope is removed from the ETT and inserted into the tracheostomy tube to confirm proper positioning.

Although most bleeding is minor, all forms should be taken seriously because even minor bleeding can be life threatening (due to obstruction or the inability to secure the airway).
