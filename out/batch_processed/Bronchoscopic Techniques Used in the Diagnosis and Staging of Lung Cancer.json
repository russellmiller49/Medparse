However, because most lung nodules are benign, there is a high demand for minimally invasive procedures that provide valuable diagnostic information while minimizing complications. Recent advances in bronchoscopic technology meet this demand. These advanced technologies include navigational bronchoscopy and radial endobronchial ultrasound (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)) for the diagnosis of peripheral lung nodules, and linear Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), which has revolutionized the nonoperative nodal staging of lung cancer and provides a complementary option to surgical staging approaches. This article reviews these new bronchoscopic technologies. J Natl Compr Canc Netw 2017;15(5):640-647 W ith the greater use of low-dose CT along with the adoption of lung cancer screening programs across the United States, the incidental detection of lung nodules is expected to increase. 1,2 Although most incidentally detected nodules are benign, 3,4 lung cancer currently constitutes 27% of all cancer-related deaths in the United States, the highest among all forms of cancer. 5 Mortality is significantly affected by stage: overall 5-year survival rates are 55% for early-stage disease, 24% for those with regional spread, and only 4% for those with metastatic disease. 5 Unfortunately, only a minority of lung cancer is diagnosed at an early stage. 5 Once a nodule is discovered on imaging, the difficulty of definitively diagnosing malignancy compounded with the importance of making an early diagnosis has emphasized the need for accurate and safe diagnostic tools. Major technological advances in the field of bronchoscopy have provided minimally invasive and comprehensive techniques to diagnose parenchymal lesions and stage lung cancer. These bronchoscopic techniques offer an alternative to surgical diagnostic procedures, such as lung resection (for lung nodules) and mediastinoscopy (for staging), and to CT-guided transthoracic needle aspiration (TTNA).

Many studies  using  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA  reported  no  significant complications.  In  one  large  meta-analysis  of  1,299 patients, there were 2 complications: 1 major (0.07%, a pneumothorax requiring a chest tube) and 1 minor (0.07%, transient hypoxemia that resolved after the procedure). 34 Given the theoretical risk of bleeding with  any  biopsy,  therapeutic  anticoagulation  and clopidogrel should ideally be held before the procedure.  However,  it  is  safe  to  continue  aspirin. 49 Although Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscopy can be performed under moderate sedation, general anesthesia is often used to allow complete staging of all nodes >5 mm."

For lung cancer,  it  has  important  diagnostic  and  therapeutic  applications.  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)  bronchoscopy  provides  a minimally invasive alternative to surgery for nodal staging  with  high  diagnostic  accuracy.  Although conventional  bronchoscopy  allows  for  easy  biopsy of  central  airway  lesions,  most  lung  nodules  are  in the periphery and not accessible using the standard bronchoscope. Adjunctive guidance tools, such as r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and NB, have been developed to aid in reaching these peripheral target lesions with significantly improved diagnostic yields. Combining these multiple  techniques  into  one  procedure  (ie,  nodal staging with linear Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) followed by sampling of a nodule with r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and NB) may potentially offer a comprehensive evaluation for lung cancer and nodal staging with minimal complications."

        "abstract": "Current widespread use of cross-sectional imaging has led to exponential rise in detection of solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs). Whilst large numbers of these are benign 'incidentalomas', lung cancers presenting as SPNs are often early disease, which have good prognosis. Therefore, there is rising demand and expectation for more accurate, non-invasive, diagnostic tests to characterize SPNs, aiming to avoid missed or delayed diagnosis of lung cancer. There are wide differential diagnoses of benign and malignant lesions that manifest as SPNs. On conventional imaging, the morphological features supporting benignity include stable small nodule size, smooth demarcated margins, and calcifications. Lack of significant contrast enhancement is also more suggestive of benign nodules. With improved understanding of tumor biology, for instance neo-vascularization and increased vascular permeability, imaging techniques such as dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) provide details on contrast uptake and wash-out kinetics, which is more closely reflecting the physiological and pathological phenomena. Positron emission tomography (PET) using 18fluorine-fluoro-deoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) is a well-established functional imaging technique, for which one of the most common indications is differentiating between benign and malignant SPNs. Combined PET-CT integrates the anatomical, morphological and metabolic aspects in a single examination, improving overall diagnostic accuracy. Semi-quantitative analysis in FDG-PET imaging is based on measurement of maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax). SUVmax analysis may become more useful as an assessment of tumor biology in future risk stratification models for cancers. Dual-time point FDG-PET imaging, dual-energy CT, perfusion CT, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging using dynamic contrast enhancement or diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) techniques, are among the growing armamentarium for diagnostic imaging of SPNs. Provided there is no unacceptably high procedural or operative risk, tissue diagnosis by resection or percutaneous biopsy of SPN should be advocated in those patients identified as at moderate or high risk of malignancy, based on clinical stratification."

Both rigid and the flexible bronchoscopes are invaluable in the diagnosis and treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Treatment of this disease process hinges on accurate diagnosis and lymph node staging. Technologies, such as endobronchial ultrasound, navigational bronchoscopy, and autofluorescence, have improved efficacy of endobronchial diagnosis and sample collection. If a patient is not a candidate for surgery and has a complication from a centrally located mass, the bronchoscope has been used to deliver palliative therapies."

Given that many nodules will be incidentally found with lung cancer screening following the publication of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), the goal is to find an accurate, safe and minimally-invasive diagnostic modality to biopsy the concerning lesions. Unfortunately, conventional bronchoscopic techniques provide a poor diagnostic yield of 18-62%. In recent years advances in technology have led to the introduction of electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy (ENB) as a tool to guide sampling of peripheral lung nodules. The same principle has also recently been expanded and applied to the transthoracic needle biopsy, referred to as electromagnetic transthoracic needle aspiration (E-TTNA). An improved diagnostic yield has afforded this technology a recommendation by the 2013 3(rd) Edition ACCP Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Lung Cancer which state that \"in patients with peripheral lung lesions difficult to reach with conventional bronchoscopy, ENB is recommended if the equipment and the expertise are available (Grade 1C)\". In this review we will discuss the technology, devices that are available, techniques and protocols, diagnostic yield, safety, cost effectiveness and more."

        "abstract": "Virtual bronchoscopic navigation (VBN) is a method in which the bronchoscope is guided on the bronchial route to a peripheral lesion using virtual bronchoscopic images. In reports on VBN for peripheral pulmonary lesions searched in PubMed as of November 2013, the diagnostic yield by ultrathin bronchoscopy in combination with computed tomography and VBN was within the range of 65.4-81.6%. Using endobronchial ultrasonography with a guide sheath (EBUS-GS) and VBN, it was between 63.3 and 84.4%, and using X-ray fluoroscopy and VBN, it was between 62.5 and 78.7%. The overall diagnostic yield was 73.8% [95% confidence interval (CI) 70.9-76.8%] and that for lesions &#x2264; 2 cm was 67.4% (95% CI 63.3-71.5%). These values indicate high diagnostic rates. In randomized comparative trials, the combination of VBN with EBUS-GS improved the diagnostic yield and shortened the examination time. The diagnostic yields for lesions in the right upper lobe, those invisible on posterior-anterior radiographs and those located in the peripheral third of the lung field were improved by VBN on ultrathin bronchoscopy in combination with X-ray fluoroscopy. The usefulness of VBN was also found on meta-analysis. Taken together, VBN is a promising navigational bronchoscopy method as it requires no specific training, has a low overall complication rate of 1.0% (95% CI 0.2-1.8%) and does not directly induce or cause severe complications. To maximize the full potential of VBN and promote its use, investigation of cases in which it is useful, determination of the optimum combination of procedures, a cost/benefit analysis and advancement of the VBN system are warranted."

Once identified, there are many strategies for diagnosis with heterogeneous risk benefit analysis. Traditional strategies such as conventional bronchoscopy have poor performance in locating and acquiring the required tissue. Similarly, while computerized-assisted transthoracic needle biopsy is currently the favored diagnostic procedure, it is associated with complications such as pneumothorax and hemorrhage. Video-assisted thoracoscopic and open surgical biopsies are invasive, require general anesthesia and are therefore not a first-line approach. New techniques such as ultrathin bronchoscopy and image-based guidance technologies are evolving to improve the diagnosis of peripheral lung lesions. Virtual bronchoscopy and electromagnetic navigation systems are novel technologies based on assisted-computerized tomography images that guide the bronchoscopist toward the target peripheral lesion. This article provides a comprehensive review of these emerging technologies."

Furthermore, TBNA results compare favorably with roentgenographic staging techniques, with the added advantage of providing cytopathologic information."

Options for tissue diagnoses include computed tomography-guided percutaneous biopsy, transbronchial fine-needle aspiration, mediastinoscopy, left anterior mediastinotomy, or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery; however, these approaches have both advantages and limitations in terms of tissue yield, safety profile, and cost. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) is a new minimally invasive technique that expands the view of the bronchoscopist beyond the lumen of the airway. There are two EBUS systems currently available. The radial probe EBUS allows for evaluation of central airways, accurate definition of airway invasion, and facilitates the diagnosis of peripheral lung lesions. Linear EBUS guides transbronchial needle aspiration of hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, improving diagnostic yield. This article will review the principles and clinical applications of EBUS, and will highlight the role of this new technology in the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer."

The involvement of ipsilateral and contralateral mediastinal lymph nodes is associated with poor prognosis and usually excludes patients from upfront surgical treatment. Mediastinoscopy is a time-honored procedure that allows the surgeon to access the upper mediastinal lymph nodes for either biopsy or removal. Remediastinoscopy is mainly indicated to assess objective tumor response in mediastinal lymph nodes after induction therapy for locally advanced lung cancer and to indicate further therapy."

Few data are available on the use of endoscopic procedures to stage the mediastinum in clinical stage 1 lung cancer. The aim of the present study was to determine the results of EBUS-TBNA in sampling mediastinal lymph nodes in patients with lung cancer and a radiographically normal mediastinum and no PET activity. From January 2004 to May 2007, patients highly suspicious for NSCLC with CT scans showing no enlarged lymph nodes (no node &gt; 1 cm) and a negative PET finding of the mediastinum underwent EBUS-TBNA. Identifiable lymph nodes at locations 2r, 2L, 4r, 4L, 7, 10r, 10L, 11r, and 11L were aspirated. All patients underwent subsequent surgical staging. Diagnoses based on aspiration results were compared with those based on surgical results. One hundred patients (mean age, 52.4 years; 59 men) were included. After surgery, 97 patients (mean age, 52.9 years; 57 men) had NSCLC confirmed and were included in the analysis. In this group, 156 lymph nodes ranging 5 to 10 mm in size were detected and sampled. Malignancy was detected in nine patients but missed in one patient. Mean diameter of the punctured lymph nodes was 7.9 mm. The sensitivity of EBUS-TBNA for detecting malignancy was 89%, specificity was 100%, and the negative predictive value was 98.9%. No complications occurred. In conclusion, EBUS-TBNA can be used to accurately sample and stage patients with clinical stage 1 lung cancer and no evidence of mediastinal involvement on CT and PET. Potentially operable patients with no signs of mediastinal involvement may benefit from presurgical staging with EBUS-TBNA."

Furthermore, novel therapies for adenocarcinoma are clinically available for specific mutation profiles. Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) has been shown to adequately obtain specimens for molecular profiling. However, it remains unclear what quantity of specimens is needed to provide suitable mutational genotyping for adenocarcinoma. The objective of this study was to determine the optimal number of aspirations per EBUS-TBNA procedure required in the presence of rapid on-site cytopathology evaluation (ROSE) for maximal diagnostic yield for molecular mutational analysis."
