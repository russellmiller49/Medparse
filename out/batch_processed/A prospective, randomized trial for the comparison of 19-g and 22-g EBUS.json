    "abstract": "The demand for tissue has increased in lung cancer through personalized medicine. Recently, larger endobronchial ultrasound needles have become available for transbronchial lymph node biopsy. We compared the new 19-gauge (G) needle with 22-G needles regarding tissue quality, feasibility, safety, and performance in a prospective manner. Signi /uniFB01 cantly more tissue and tumor cells per slide were obtained with a 19-G needle. Background: The use of 22- or 21-gauge (G) endobronchial ultrasound (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)) needles are recommended for lung cancer diagnosis and staging. Performance of detailed molecular workup and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) staining in lung cancer patients increases the demand for tissue. The aim of this prospective, randomized two-center trial was to compare 19-G and 22-G Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) needles regarding tissue quality, diagnostic yield, feasibility, safety, performance, and blood content. Patients and Methods: Patients with a computed tomography scan indicative of lung cancer with mediastinal or hilar lymph node metastases were prospectively enrolled and randomized for the use of either a 19-G or a 22-G Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) needle. A blood content score from 0 to 2 was applied. Samples were weighed, tumor cells were counted per slide, and complications and /uniFB01 nal diagnoses were documented. Results: We enrolled 107 patients (53 [49.5%] in the 19-G group/54 [50.5%] in the 22-G group) and samples were weighed immediately after performing Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS). Samples obtained with a 19-G needle contained signi /uniFB01 cantly more tissue ( P ¼ .0119). Non e smallcell lung cancer-in /uniFB01 ltrated Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) samples contained signi /uniFB01 cantly more tumor cells when sampled with a 19-G needle ( P ¼ .0312). The diagnostic yield was equally adequate in both groups. Four moderate Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-related bleedings occurred (2 per group), hemostasis was rapidly achieved in all cases. Further complications did not occur. Conclusion: Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspirations with a 19-G needle contain signi /uniFB01 cantly These data were presented, in part, at the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Pneumologie, March 23, 2017, and the American Thoracic Society, May 21, 2017.

Recently, larger endobronchial ultrasound needles have become available for transbronchial lymph node biopsy. We compared the new 19-gauge (G) needle with 22-G needles regarding tissue quality, feasibility, safety, and performance in a prospective manner. Signi /uniFB01 cantly more tissue and tumor cells per slide were obtained with a 19-G needle. Background: The use of 22- or 21-gauge (G) endobronchial ultrasound (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)) needles are recommended for lung cancer diagnosis and staging. Performance of detailed molecular workup and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) staining in lung cancer patients increases the demand for tissue. The aim of this prospective, randomized two-center trial was to compare 19-G and 22-G Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) needles regarding tissue quality, diagnostic yield, feasibility, safety, performance, and blood content. Patients and Methods: Patients with a computed tomography scan indicative of lung cancer with mediastinal or hilar lymph node metastases were prospectively enrolled and randomized for the use of either a 19-G or a 22-G Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) needle. A blood content score from 0 to 2 was applied. Samples were weighed, tumor cells were counted per slide, and complications and /uniFB01 nal diagnoses were documented. Results: We enrolled 107 patients (53 [49.5%] in the 19-G group/54 [50.5%] in the 22-G group) and samples were weighed immediately after performing Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS). Samples obtained with a 19-G needle contained signi /uniFB01 cantly more tissue ( P ¼ .0119). Non e smallcell lung cancer-in /uniFB01 ltrated Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) samples contained signi /uniFB01 cantly more tumor cells when sampled with a 19-G needle ( P ¼ .0312). The diagnostic yield was equally adequate in both groups. Four moderate Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-related bleedings occurred (2 per group), hemostasis was rapidly achieved in all cases.

Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) samples obtained using a 22-G and even with a 21-G needle are sometimes not suf /uniFB01 cient for these extensive molecular analyses and PD-L1 staining. 10,16 The manufacturer, Olympus, has addressed this problem and recently developed a larger Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA needle. The 19-G Vizishot FLEX Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) needle (Olympus) has the same outer diameter as a 22-G Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) needle but a larger inner diameter. In addition the needle is composed of a more /uniFB02 exible material (nitinol) than the 22-G Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) needle."

We hypothesized that the 19-G needle would yield more tissue, without increasing complications compared with 22-G needles. The aim of this prospective, randomized two-center study was to compare 19-G and 22-G Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) needles regarding specimen tissue quality and procedural safety. To improve the assessment of tissue quality, we sought to introduce a novel end point of tissue weight adjusted for blood content."

Either the 19-G (NA-U402SX-4019; Olympus) or the 22-G (NA-201SX-4022; Olympus) needles were used by experienced attending interventional pulmonologists. Additional suction was not applied. Simple randomization to the 19-G or 22-G group was performed using a randomization list (Microsoft Excel 2013) in the bronchoscopy suite before the procedure. Patients underwent lymph node biopsy with the use of either a 19-G or a 22-G needle. Patients and pathologists were blinded for the needle size. The lymph node biopsy procedure was standardized as follows: all patients received a complete mediastinal and hilar lymph node staging via Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), sampling all lymph nodes larger than 5 mm. The lymph node with the highest probability for malignant in /uniFB01 ltration on the basis of size and sonographic appearance was sampled with 3 to 5 passes. 6,19,20 Each pass consisted of 10 to 15 needle thrusts. Samples were considered adequate if cytological analysis identi /uniFB01 ed lymphocytes or if a de /uniFB01 nitive diagnosis could be established. In this study rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) was omitted. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA samples were expelled from the needle into a vessel of 5 mL 4% buffered formalin using the internal stylet in accordance with recent guideline recommendations 21 and were subsequently sent for cytopathological evaluation. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed for lung cancer subtyping if required. Blood content of each sample was evaluated using a semiquantitative score from 0 to 2 (0 ¼ no visible blood, 1 ¼ light red shading, 2 ¼ red shading; Figure 1). Each lymph node sample was weighed on a pathology slide using a precision balance (Sartorius BP61, Goettingen, Germany) and divided by the number of passes.

After normalization, the sample weight per needle pass was signi /uniFB01 cantly larger when sampled with a 19-G Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) needle ( P ¼ .0016; Table 2, Figure 3).",

We found that 19-G needle samples showed signi /uniFB01 cantly more blood content as shown in Figure 1. This /uniFB01 nding is consistent with that of previous studies, including 2 smaller trials that compared 19-G and 22-G Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) needles, suggesting increased blood content for larger needles. 7,17,18 In the study by Nakajima et al, who compared 22-G and 21-G needles, increased blood content was also documented. 7 In that study the authors described if a sample contained more or less blood using the 21-G needle or the 22-G needle without mentioning the exact amount or using a score. 7 Of note, in the study by Nakajima et al, 2 needle sizes were used on the same lymph node; in this trial only a single needle was used per patient, making direct comparison of the blood content more dif /uniFB01 cult. Saji et al also compared 21-G and 22-G EBUSTBNAs. They used the width of the sample as a parameter of tissue quality and reported not to have assessed the weight of the sample because of differences in blood content. 24 They did not report any differences between the sample widths of specimens obtained with a 21-G or a 22-G needle, however, a single dimension is probably not suf /uniFB01 cient to assess the size of a sample. In a recently published retrospective trial comparing 22-G and 19-G Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA samples, the volume of the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA samples was assessed. To overcome the blood content effect, the tissue samples were placed on /uniFB01 lter paper. 25 The authors conclude that volumes of 19-G Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) samples were larger, however, the retrospective nature of the report did not allow sample size calculation and only 45 patients were studied. Also, one could argue that through putting the sample on /uniFB01 lter paper, cells would get lost, and it would be hard to control how many tumor cells are actually lost and not be counted for the secondary end point of tumor cell",

However, because of the larger tissue amounts sampled with the 19-G needle and higher tumor cell counts in the Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)-in /uniFB01 ltrated samples and a previously reported signi /uniFB01 -cant correlation between Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) sample weights and DNA content it is very likely that SCLC tumor cell counts would also be signi /uniFB01 cantly higher if sampled with a 19-G needle compared with a 22-G needle. 21 Tumor cell counts per biopsy might be in /uniFB02 uenced by several factors: the biology of the tumor, the pattern of lymph node in /uniFB01 ltration by tumor cells, and the angle at which the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA needle is inserted into the lymph node. One of the limitations of this study was that a single needle size was used for each patient. Because cellularity of tumors can vary between patients, the differences between the tumor cell counts might have been even more signi /uniFB01 cant if needles of both sizes were used in the same lymph node in every patient; this might be considered in future studies. We still believe, that with the calculated sample size and overall similar lymph node sizes in both groups, the results would have been very similar if 2 needles would have been used per lymph node.",

The effect of additional nodal tissue weight obtained using the 19-G needle on the ability to enable comprehensive molecular analyses and PD-L1 staining should be further investigated. There are multiple factors that might increase the adequacy and utility of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) biopsies. In particular, ROSE was associated with increased adequacy for diagnostic and molecular analyses. 26-28 In this study, ROSE was omitted because the entire sample was weighed in the formalin vessel.

Two patients experienced moderate bleeding (1 per group), both of which had received therapeutic anticoagulation until the evening before the intervention and therefore had an increased bleeding risk. Overall the bleeding risk with both needles is minimal and not increased with use of a larger needle size."

Although we were successful in showing a signi /uniFB01 cantly larger tissue weight in the 19-G group when corrected for blood content, the comparison of secondary end points was limited by the sample size in some of the groups such as SCLC. Additionally, the overall complication rate of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA is known to be low, and larger cohorts will be necessary to assess rates of rare, severe complications. 29-31 However, we do not anticipate signi /uniFB01 cant differences in complication rates on the basis of our results and those of previous retrospective studies on 19-G EBUSTBNA needles with smaller patient cohorts, which reported similar complication rates and diagnostic yields. 25,32,33 Last, the comparative evaluation of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) samples for molecular testing extends beyond the scope of this trial. Although we clearly showed that 19-G needles can yield more tissue and tumor cells and have previously shown a significant correlation between Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA weight and DNA concentration, we are unable to correlate this with the adequacy for various molecular tests in this study. The absolute tissue amount required to ful /uniFB01 ll all current and future diagnostic tests likely varies signi /uniFB01 cantly between institutions, and depends largely on the extent and type of tests performed. One could argue that acquisition of more cores with a smaller needle (22-G) would lead to the same tissue amount, however, because of high costs of procedural times ($10-$60 per minute) and busy clinical schedules, it would be bene /uniFB01 cial to reduce procedural durations even minimally. 34"

Overall, there were 14.1 million new cases and 8.2 million deaths in 2012. The most commonly diagnosed cancers were lung (1.82 million), breast (1.67 million), and colorectal (1.36 million); the most common causes of cancer death were lung cancer (1.6 million deaths), liver cancer (745,000 deaths), and stomach cancer (723,000 deaths)."

However, it remains unclear what quantity of specimens is needed to provide suitable mutational genotyping for adenocarcinoma.

All recommendation documents are based on the expertise of committee members, an extensive literature review, and feedback from presentations at national and international conferences. The guideline documents selectively present the results of these discussions. The present document summarizes recommendations for ancillary testing of cytologic samples. Ancillary testing including microbiologic, immunocytochemical, flow cytometric, and molecular testing, including next-generation sequencing are discussed. Diagn.

In contrast, Kirsten rat sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutations are negative predictors for benefit from EGFR-targeting agents. Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is well-established for lung cancer diagnosis and staging. Next generation sequencing (NGS) allows for simultaneous interrogation for multiple mutations but has limitations (required tumor tissue amount, assay times). Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using light-Cycler technology (LCRT-PCR) can rapidly and sensitively detect somatic mutations from NSCLC patients. In the present study, we analyzed the feasibility of LCRT-PCR for rapid EGFRdelEx19 and KRAS exon 2 mutation detection in EBUS-TBNA samples and compared the LCRT-PCR and NGS results."

At the same time, biopsy specimens are becoming increasingly smaller as diagnostic algorithms seek to establish diagnosis and stage with the least invasive techniques. Here, we review techniques used in the diagnosis of lung cancer including bronchoscopy, ultrasound-guided bronchoscopy, transthoracic needle biopsy, and thoracoscopy. In addition to discussing indications and complications, we focus our discussion on diagnostic yields and the feasibility of testing for molecular biomarkers such as epidermal growth factor receptor and anaplastic lymphoma kinase, emphasizing the importance of a sufficient tumor biopsy."

We found that 19-G needle samples showed signi /uniFB01 cantly more blood content as shown in Figure 1. This /uniFB01 nding is consistent with that of previous studies, including 2 smaller trials that compared 19-G and 22-G Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) needles, suggesting increased blood content for larger needles. 7,17,18 In the study by Nakajima et al, who compared 22-G and 21-G needles, increased blood content was also documented. 7 In that study the authors described if a sample contained more or less blood using the 21-G needle or the 22-G needle without mentioning the exact amount or using a score. 7 Of note, in the study by Nakajima et al, 2 needle sizes were used on the same lymph node; in this trial only a single needle was used per patient, making direct comparison of the blood content more dif /uniFB01 cult. Saji et al also compared 21-G and 22-G EBUSTBNAs. They used the width of the sample as a parameter of tissue quality and reported not to have assessed the weight of the sample because of differences in blood content. 24 They did not report any differences between the sample widths of specimens obtained with a 21-G or a 22-G needle, however, a single dimension is probably not suf /uniFB01 cient to assess the size of a sample. In a recently published retrospective trial comparing 22-G and 19-G Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA samples, the volume of the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA samples was assessed. To overcome the blood content effect, the tissue samples were placed on /uniFB01 lter paper. 25 The authors conclude that volumes of 19-G Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) samples were larger, however, the retrospective nature of the report did not allow sample size calculation and only 45 patients were studied. Also, one could argue that through putting the sample on /uniFB01 lter paper, cells would get lost, and it would be hard to control how many tumor cells are actually lost and not be counted for the secondary end point of tumor cell",

Because of the high diagnostic yield for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) exceeding 90%, it is not surprising that no differences were detected. A problem with both studies was the relatively small size. In our current study, we have overcome some of the methodological problems of comparing tissue quality, and introduced a novel end point of tissue weight corrected for blood content, which is clinically more meaningful with regard to molecular analyses.",

There are multiple factors that might increase the adequacy and utility of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) biopsies. In particular, ROSE was associated with increased adequacy for diagnostic and molecular analyses. 26-28 In this study, ROSE was omitted because the entire sample was weighed in the formalin vessel.

We found that 19-G needle samples showed signi /uniFB01 cantly more blood content as shown in Figure 1. This /uniFB01 nding is consistent with that of previous studies, including 2 smaller trials that compared 19-G and 22-G Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) needles, suggesting increased blood content for larger needles. 7,17,18 In the study by Nakajima et al, who compared 22-G and 21-G needles, increased blood content was also documented. 7 In that study the authors described if a sample contained more or less blood using the 21-G needle or the 22-G needle without mentioning the exact amount or using a score. 7 Of note, in the study by Nakajima et al, 2 needle sizes were used on the same lymph node; in this trial only a single needle was used per patient, making direct comparison of the blood content more dif /uniFB01 cult. Saji et al also compared 21-G and 22-G EBUSTBNAs. They used the width of the sample as a parameter of tissue quality and reported not to have assessed the weight of the sample because of differences in blood content. 24 They did not report any differences between the sample widths of specimens obtained with a 21-G or a 22-G needle, however, a single dimension is probably not suf /uniFB01 cient to assess the size of a sample. In a recently published retrospective trial comparing 22-G and 19-G Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA samples, the volume of the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA samples was assessed. To overcome the blood content effect, the tissue samples were placed on /uniFB01 lter paper. 25 The authors conclude that volumes of 19-G Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) samples were larger, however, the retrospective nature of the report did not allow sample size calculation and only 45 patients were studied. Also, one could argue that through putting the sample on /uniFB01 lter paper, cells would get lost, and it would be hard to control how many tumor cells are actually lost and not be counted for the secondary end point of tumor cell",

Because of the high diagnostic yield for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) exceeding 90%, it is not surprising that no differences were detected. A problem with both studies was the relatively small size. In our current study, we have overcome some of the methodological problems of comparing tissue quality, and introduced a novel end point of tissue weight corrected for blood content, which is clinically more meaningful with regard to molecular analyses.",

The effect of additional nodal tissue weight obtained using the 19-G needle on the ability to enable comprehensive molecular analyses and PD-L1 staining should be further investigated. There are multiple factors that might increase the adequacy and utility of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) biopsies. In particular, ROSE was associated with increased adequacy for diagnostic and molecular analyses. 26-28 In this study, ROSE was omitted because the entire sample was weighed in the formalin vessel.
