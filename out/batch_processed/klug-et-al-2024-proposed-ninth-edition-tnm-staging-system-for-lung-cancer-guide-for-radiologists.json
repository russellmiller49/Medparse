Precise staging is imperative for the development of successful treatment approaches and improvement of patient outcomes. Traditionally, lung cancer staging has depended on the TNM staging system, and the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) has recently recommended modifi.ligacations. The updated classifi.ligacation for the ninth edition of the TNM staging system (TNM-9), slated to take eff.ligaect in January 2025, is derived from a thorough analysis of a newly established large international database of lung cancer cases compiled by the IASLC. Proposed changes in TNM-9 include the following: (a) The mediastinal nodal category (N2) was split into single-station (N2a) and multiple-station (N2b) subcategories, and (b) multiple extrathoracic metastatic lesions (M1c) were split into single organ system (M1c1) and multiple organ systems (M1c2) subcategories. Considering these revisions, adjustments have been made to the established stage groups. In terms of pathologic nodal staging, patients in the post-neoadjuvant ypN category demonstrated worse prognosis than those in the similar non-neoadjuvant pN category. Understanding the fundamental changes introduced in TNM-9 enables radiologists to precisely determine the clinical stage of lung cancer and enhance therapeutic approaches."

Although IASLC's ninth edition database has a similar number of evaluable lung cancer cases as the seventh and eighth editions  (TNM-7  and  TNM-8),  with  more  than  100 000  patients  (4),  the  collected  data  have  much  greater  granularity to address the limitations of TNM-8, which include the lack of quantifi.ligacation  of  nodal  metastatic burden, lack of granularity within the M1c category, and exclusion of patients who have  undergone  neoadjuvant  therapy  from  staging  evaluation (5). Neoadjuvant refers to treatment given as a fi.ligarst step to shrink the tumor before the main treatment, usually surgery. In terms of the staging assessments, the prefi.ligax 'y' indicates restaging and pertains to patients who have received neoadjuvant therapy. Analysis of this new database showed signifi.ligacant  diff.ligaerences  in  survival  between  patients  within subgroups of the N2 and M1c categories and a worse prognosis for patients with ypN disease (pathologic N a/f_t.ligaer neoadjuvant therapy) than for those with pN (pathologic N without neoadjuvant therapy) disease (6). General recommendations for modifi.ligacation of these descriptors and overall stage groups have been published (3), with more supporting literature yet to be published. The aim of this article is to review the proposals for TNM-9 staging for lung cancer with an emphasis on clinical staging as it pertains to imaging interpretation."

Because TNM-8 introduced profound changes to the T descriptor, the goal of the analysis of TNM-9 revisions was to validate the T descriptors  of  TNM-8  and  assess  whether  further  changes were necessary. Analysis from the new database supported no change for T descriptors from TNM-8 (7). Because a major part of T staging relies on tumor size, and each 1-cm increment from 1 cm to 5 cm worsens the prognosis, care should be taken to optimize the acquisition of CT images and to perform accurate tumor measurements. For CT evaluation of the T descriptor, lung window settings with a sharp fi.ligalter are used and images should be contiguous with a section thickness of 1 mm or less (8).  This  decreases  partial  averaging  and  facilitates  accurate measurements and characterization of nodule type, whether solid,  part-solid,  or  pure  ground  glass.  For  staging  purposes, the long-axis diameter of the solid primary tumor is recorded, whether in the axial, sagittal, or coronal planes. For staging of the part-solid primary tumor, the clinical T descriptor is determined by the longest diameter of the solid component because it correlates better with the invasive component of the tumor at pathologic evaluation. In addition, recording the overall diameter (including the ground-glass component) will enable future evaluation to assess if this parameter aff.ligaects prognosis (8).",

It is important for radiologists to understand the crucial points in the T, N, and M classifi.ligacations, more so than the fi.liganal stage group. Some of the nuances in the staging descriptors, such as the diff.ligaerence between T1b and T1c, can lead to a diff.ligaerent therapeutic approach, without a substantial change in the overall stage classifi.ligacation. For example, in two recent  randomized  trials  (23,24),  sublobar  resection,  rather than  lobectomy,  was  shown  to  be  a  valid  treatment  option for T1 lung cancers measuring 2 cm or smaller (23-25).

A potential factor is the timing of the adoption of TNM-8 by the Union for International Cancer Control and the American Joint Committee on Cancer in 2017  (26,27).  Because  the  cases  included  in  the  IASLC  and CRAB database ranged from 2011 to 2019, most of them were submitted before the implementation of this updated tumor measurement defi.liganition (7). Because most of the submitted cases did not provide the total size in addition to the required measurements  of  the  solid-invasive  component,  this  point could not be analyzed, and the current recommendation is to use the solid component only for the T descriptor while also reporting the total size, with the ground-glass component in"

Although overall  survival  was  worse  for  all  patients  who  underwent neoadjuvant  treatment  (ypT)  compared  with  that  for  those who did  not  undergo  induction  therapy,  sample  sizes  were small and the fi.ligandings must be confi.ligarmed in larger patient populations (7)."

This issue remains for future staging revisions to resolve, it is hoped, with more cases in which metastatic lesion size is documented. For the defi.liganition of oligometastatic disease, multiple cutoff.liga points including three, fi.ligave, and seven extrathoracic metastatic lesions have been examined. Diff.ligaerences in survival suggest that there is a continuum of worsening prognosis with an increasing number of metastatic lesions (18). Another aspect not explored because of insuffi.ligacient data involves determining whether there should be a cap on the number of metastatic lesions within a single organ system. This issue is important because the clinical care of patients with M1c1 disease may vary according to the number of lesions. Exploratory analysis results (18) indicated variations in prognosis among M1 subsets associated with diff.ligaerent organs, particularly the brain, requiring further investigation for future revision."

        "abstract": "Lung cancer remains one of the leading cause of global cancer-related mortality, posing a significant burden of disease. Tobacco exposure stands as the foremost risk factor for lung cancer. Since the 1960, global efforts have gradually been implemented to control tobacco exposure, consequently reducing tobacco exposure levels within populations. This shift in exposure levels may have altered the epidemiological characteristics of lung cancer globally. This study aims to describe global lung cancer incidence data across five dimensions: age, gender, region, stage at diagnosis, and survival status, using global cancer registry data and relevant research findings. The objective is to elucidate the current epidemiological features of lung cancer worldwide, providing a scientific basis for lung cancer prevention and control. Furthermore, this study offers corresponding measures and recommendations for lung cancer prevention and control, aligning with the three-tiered cancer prevention strategy. Findings indicate that the incidence and mortality burden of lung cancer is significantly higher among the elderly population (aged 65 years and above) compared to the working-age population (aged 15-64 years). The aged-standardized incidence rate of lung cancer remains higher in males than in females, but the overall aged-standardized incidence rate of lung cancer in males shows a declining trend, while that in females shows an increasing trend. Regions with high and very high human development index (HDI) exhibit a substantially higher incidence and mortality burden of lung cancer compared to regions with low and very low HDI. Japan ranks highest in the diagnosis of stage &#x2160; lung cancer, with a diagnosis rate of 38.6%. Its age-standardized 5-year net survival rate is relatively high at 32.9%. Despite improvements in the survival status of lung cancer in certain countries like China and Japan, the overall prognosis for lung cancer remains pessimistic. Given the current epidemiological characteristics of lung cancer, reinforcing tobacco control measures and reducing female-specific lung cancer risk factors stand as significant goals for primary prevention. Promoting low-dose computed tomography screening for high-risk population, minimizing false-positive rates in lung cancer screening, and promoting medical system reforms and standardized treatment constitute principal measures for secondary and tertiary lung cancer prevention, respectively."

        "abstract": "Since its conception by Pierre Denoix in the mid-20th century, the tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) classification has undergone seven revisions. The North American database managed by Clifton Mountain was used to inform the 2nd to the 6th editions, and an international database collected by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, promoted by Peter Goldstraw, was used to inform the 7th and the 8th editions. In these two latest editions, it was evident that the impact of tumor size was much greater than it was suggested in previous editions; that the amount of nodal disease had prognostic relevance; and that the number and location of the distant metastases had prognostic implications. However, the TNM classification is not the only prognostic factor. Data are being collected now to inform the 9th edition of the TNM classification, scheduled for publication in 2024. Patient-, environment-, and tumor-related factors, including biomarkers (genetic biomarkers, copy number alterations, and protein alterations) are being collected to combine them in prognostic groups to enhance the prognosis provided by the mere anatomic extent of the tumor, and to offer a more personalized prognosis to an individual patient. International collaboration is essential to build a large and detailed database to achieve these objectives."

In 2011, new entities of AIS, MIA, and lepidic predominant adenocarcinoma were defined, and they were later incorporated into the 2015 World Health Organization classification of lung cancer. To fit these entities into the T component of the staging system, the Tis category is proposed for AIS, with Tis (AIS) specified if it is to be distinguished from squamous cell carcinoma in situ (SCIS), which is to be designated Tis (SCIS). We also propose that MIA be classified as T1mi. Furthermore, the use of the invasive size for T descriptor size follows a recommendation made in three editions of the Union for International Cancer Control tumor, node, and metastasis supplement since 2003. For tumor size, the greatest dimension should be reported both clinically and pathologically. In nonmucinous lung adenocarcinomas, the computed tomography (CT) findings of ground glass versus solid opacities tend to correspond respectively to lepidic versus invasive patterns seen pathologically. However, this correlation is not absolute; so when CT features suggest nonmucinous AIS, MIA, and lepidic predominant adenocarcinoma, the suspected diagnosis and clinical staging should be regarded as a preliminary assessment that is subject to revision after pathologic evaluation of resected specimens. The ability to predict invasive versus noninvasive size on the basis of solid versus ground glass components is not applicable to mucinous AIS, MIA, or invasive mucinous adenocarcinomas because they generally show solid nodules or consolidation on CT."

        "abstract": "<b>BACKGROUND.</b> Increased (but not definitively solid) attenuation within pure ground-glass nodules (pGGNs) may indicate invasive adenocarcinoma and the need for resection rather than surveillance. <b>OBJECTIVE.</b> The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes among resected pGGNs, heterogeneous ground-glass nodules (GGNs), and part-solid nodules (PSNs). <b>METHODS.</b> This retrospective study included 469 patients (335 female patients and 134 male patients; median age, 68 years [IQR, 62.5-73.5 years]) who, between January 2012 and December 2020, underwent resection of lung adenocarcinoma that appeared as a subsolid nodule on CT. Two radiologists, using lung windows, independently classified each nodule as a pGGN, a heterogeneous GGN, or a PSN, resolving discrepancies through discussion. A heterogeneous GGN was defined as a GGN with internal increased attenuation not quite as dense as that of pulmonary vessels, and a PSN was defined as having an internal solid component with the same attenuation as that of the pulmonary vessels. Outcomes included pathologic diagnosis of invasive adenocarcinoma, 5-year recurrence rates (locoregional or distant), and recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) over 7 years, as analyzed by Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses, with censoring of patients with incomplete follow-up. <b>RESULTS.</b> Interobserver agreement for nodule type, expressed as a kappa coefficient, was 0.69. Using consensus assessments, 59 nodules were pGGNs, 109 were heterogeneous GGNs, and 301 were PSNs. The frequency of invasive adenocarcinoma was 39.0% in pGGNs, 67.9% in heterogeneous GGNs, and 75.7% in PSNs (for pGGNs vs heterogeneous GGNs, <i>p</i> &lt; .001; for pGGNs vs PSNs, <i>p</i> &lt; .001; and for heterogeneous GGNs vs PSNs, <i>p</i> = .28). The 5-year recurrence rate was 0.0% in patients with pGGNs, 6.3% in those with heterogeneous GGNs, and 10.8% in those with PSNs (for pGGNs vs heterogeneous GGNs, <i>p</i> = .06; for pGGNs vs PSNs, <i>p</i> = .02; and for heterogeneous GGNs vs PSNs, <i>p</i> = .18). At 7 years, RFS was 97.7% in patients with pGGNs, 82.0% in those with heterogeneous GGNs, and 79.4% in those with PSNs (for pGGNs vs heterogeneous GGNs, <i>p</i> = .02; for pGGNs vs PSNs, <i>p</i> = .006; and for heterogeneous GGNs vs PSNs, <i>p</i> = .40); OS was 98.0% in patients with pGGNs, 84.6% in those with heterogeneous GGNs, and 82.9% in those with PSNs (for pGGNs vs heterogeneous GGNs, <i>p</i> = .04; for pGGNs vs PSNs, <i>p</i> = .01; and for heterogeneous GGNs vs PSNs, <i>p</i> = .50). <b>CONCLUSION.</b> Resected pGGNs had excellent clinical outcomes. Heterogeneous GGNs had relatively worse outcomes, more closely resembling outcomes for PSNs. <b>CLINICAL IMPACT.</b> The findings support surveillance for truly homogeneous pGGNs versus resection for GGNs showing internal increased attenuation even if not having a true solid component."

Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, and positron emission tomography (PET)/CT contribute important and complementary information. Whereas CT is optimal for depicting bone erosion and for staging of intrathoracic disease, MR imaging is superior for evaluating tumor extension to the intervertebral neural foramina, the spinal cord, and the brachial plexus, primarily because of the higher contrast resolution and multiplanar capability available with MR imaging technology. Use of PET/CT enables the detection of unsuspected nodal and distant metastases. However, imaging has only limited usefulness for evaluating the response of a tumor to induction therapy and detecting local recurrence, and surgical biopsy often is necessary to verify the results of therapy."

In a prospective study, endosonography alone had an unsatisfactory sensitivity (38%) in detecting N2 disease. The current prospective multicentre trial investigated the sensitivity of preoperative mediastinal staging by video-assisted mediastinoscopy (VAM) or VAM-lymphadenectomy (VAMLA).Consecutive patients with operable and resectable (suspected) NSCLC and cN1 after PET-CT imaging underwent VAM(LA). The primary study outcome was sensitivity to detect N2 disease. Secondary endpoints were the prevalence of N2 disease, negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy of VAM(LA).Out of 105 patients with cN1 on imaging, 26% eventually developed N2 disease. Invasive mediastinal staging with VAM(LA) had a sensitivity of 73% to detect N2 disease. The NPV was 92% and accuracy 93%. Median number of assessed lymph node stations during VAM(LA) was 4 (IQR 3-5), and in 96%, at least three stations were assessed.VAM(LA) has a satisfactory sensitivity of 73% to detect mediastinal nodal disease in cN1 lung cancer, and could be the technique of choice for pre-resection mediastinal lymph node assessment in this patient group with a one in four chance of occult-positive mediastinal nodes after negative PET-CT."

Because TNM-8 introduced profound changes to the T descriptor, the goal of the analysis of TNM-9 revisions was to validate the T descriptors  of  TNM-8  and  assess  whether  further  changes were necessary. Analysis from the new database supported no change for T descriptors from TNM-8 (7). Because a major part of T staging relies on tumor size, and each 1-cm increment from 1 cm to 5 cm worsens the prognosis, care should be taken to optimize the acquisition of CT images and to perform accurate tumor measurements. For CT evaluation of the T descriptor, lung window settings with a sharp fi.ligalter are used and images should be contiguous with a section thickness of 1 mm or less (8).  This  decreases  partial  averaging  and  facilitates  accurate measurements and characterization of nodule type, whether solid,  part-solid,  or  pure  ground  glass.  For  staging  purposes, the long-axis diameter of the solid primary tumor is recorded, whether in the axial, sagittal, or coronal planes. For staging of the part-solid primary tumor, the clinical T descriptor is determined by the longest diameter of the solid component because it correlates better with the invasive component of the tumor at pathologic evaluation. In addition, recording the overall diameter (including the ground-glass component) will enable future evaluation to assess if this parameter aff.ligaects prognosis (8)."

The rationale for applying diff.ligaerent TNM staging rules to these two entities is that they exhibit diff.ligaerent biologic behavior, including survival and recurrence patterns (19,20).

These additional nodules do not need to be biopsied, and staging is applied using the accepted clinical criteria (Table 4). In terms of clinical staging, the highest T descriptor is provided by the dominant nodule. The number of subsolid lesions in both lungs is counted and designated with a number sign (#) in the T descriptor or a lower case 'm' for 'multiple' in parenthesis, with a single N and M for all tumors (highest T[#/m]NM) (Fig 17).

These patients have much longer overall survival  time  and  diff.ligaer  in  patterns  of progression. Distant recurrence is unusual, whereas local recurrence and the appearance of new primary lung lesions are more common (19).

          "). Because TNM-8 introduced profound changes to the T descriptor, the goal of the analysis of TNM-9 revisions was to validate the T descriptors  of  TNM-8  and  assess  whether  further  changes were necessary. Analysis from the new database supported no change for T descriptors from TNM-8 (7). Because a major part of T staging relies on tumor size, and each 1-cm increment from 1 cm to 5 cm worsens the prognosis, care should be taken to optimize the acquisition of CT images and to perform accurate tumor measurements. For CT evaluation of the T descriptor, lung window settings with a sharp fi.ligalter are used and images should be contiguous with a section thickness of 1 mm or less (8).  This  decreases  partial  averaging  and  facilitates  accurate measurements and characterization of nodule type, whether solid,  part-solid,  or  pure  ground  glass.  For  staging  purposes, the long-axis diameter of the solid primary tumor is recorded, whether in the axial, sagittal, or coronal planes. For staging of the part-solid primary tumor, the clinical T descriptor is determined by the longest diameter of the solid component because it correlates better with the invasive component of the tumor at pathologic evaluation. In addition, recording the overall diameter (including the ground-glass component) will enable future evaluation to assess if this parameter aff.ligaects prognosis (8)."

The rationale for applying diff.ligaerent TNM staging rules to these two entities is that they exhibit diff.ligaerent biologic behavior, including survival and recurrence patterns (19,20).

In  the  clonality  studies  that  were  performed  in  this  entity, 71%-83% of those nodules studied were indeed of a diff.ligaerent clone, but such studies are few (19). These additional nodules do not need to be biopsied, and staging is applied using the accepted clinical criteria (Table 4). In terms of clinical staging, the highest T descriptor is provided by the dominant nodule. The number of subsolid lesions in both lungs is counted and designated with a number sign (#) in the T descriptor or a lower case 'm' for 'multiple' in parenthesis, with a single N and M for all tumors (highest T[#/m]NM) (Fig 17).

It is important for radiologists  to  identify multifocal lung adenocarcinoma with ground-glass features because the staging and patient treatment are diff.ligaerent from those for pulmonary metastatic disease. These patients have much longer overall survival  time  and  diff.ligaer  in  patterns  of progression. Distant recurrence is unusual, whereas local recurrence and the appearance of new primary lung lesions are more common (19).

          "). Because TNM-8 introduced profound changes to the T descriptor, the goal of the analysis of TNM-9 revisions was to validate the T descriptors  of  TNM-8  and  assess  whether  further  changes were necessary. Analysis from the new database supported no change for T descriptors from TNM-8 (7). Because a major part of T staging relies on tumor size, and each 1-cm increment from 1 cm to 5 cm worsens the prognosis, care should be taken to optimize the acquisition of CT images and to perform accurate tumor measurements. For CT evaluation of the T descriptor, lung window settings with a sharp fi.ligalter are used and images should be contiguous with a section thickness of 1 mm or less (8).  This  decreases  partial  averaging  and  facilitates  accurate measurements and characterization of nodule type, whether solid,  part-solid,  or  pure  ground  glass.  For  staging  purposes, the long-axis diameter of the solid primary tumor is recorded, whether in the axial, sagittal, or coronal planes. For staging of the part-solid primary tumor, the clinical T descriptor is determined by the longest diameter of the solid component because it correlates better with the invasive component of the tumor at pathologic evaluation. In addition, recording the overall diameter (including the ground-glass component) will enable future evaluation to assess if this parameter aff.ligaects prognosis (8)."

The rationale for applying diff.ligaerent TNM staging rules to these two entities is that they exhibit diff.ligaerent biologic behavior, including survival and recurrence patterns (19,20).

These additional nodules do not need to be biopsied, and staging is applied using the accepted clinical criteria (Table 4). In terms of clinical staging, the highest T descriptor is provided by the dominant nodule. The number of subsolid lesions in both lungs is counted and designated with a number sign (#) in the T descriptor or a lower case 'm' for 'multiple' in parenthesis, with a single N and M for all tumors (highest T[#/m]NM) (Fig 17).

These patients have much longer overall survival  time  and  diff.ligaer  in  patterns  of progression. Distant recurrence is unusual, whereas local recurrence and the appearance of new primary lung lesions are more common (19).

In addition, the prognostic implication of lymphangitic carcinomatosis could not be evaluated because such data were sparse in the database. Data entry for the TNM database is usually performed by  research  assistants  or  clinicians  using  the  radiology  report. Awareness of the nuances of TNM-9 allows radiologists to provide accurate detailed descriptions for staging not only for individual patients but also for future staging renditions that will rely on these reports.",

          "). Because TNM-8 introduced profound changes to the T descriptor, the goal of the analysis of TNM-9 revisions was to validate the T descriptors  of  TNM-8  and  assess  whether  further  changes were necessary. Analysis from the new database supported no change for T descriptors from TNM-8 (7). Because a major part of T staging relies on tumor size, and each 1-cm increment from 1 cm to 5 cm worsens the prognosis, care should be taken to optimize the acquisition of CT images and to perform accurate tumor measurements. For CT evaluation of the T descriptor, lung window settings with a sharp fi.ligalter are used and images should be contiguous with a section thickness of 1 mm or less (8).  This  decreases  partial  averaging  and  facilitates  accurate measurements and characterization of nodule type, whether solid,  part-solid,  or  pure  ground  glass.  For  staging  purposes, the long-axis diameter of the solid primary tumor is recorded, whether in the axial, sagittal, or coronal planes. For staging of the part-solid primary tumor, the clinical T descriptor is determined by the longest diameter of the solid component because it correlates better with the invasive component of the tumor at pathologic evaluation. In addition, recording the overall diameter (including the ground-glass component) will enable future evaluation to assess if this parameter aff.ligaects prognosis (8)."
