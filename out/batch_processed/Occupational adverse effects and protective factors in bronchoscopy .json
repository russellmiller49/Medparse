The long-term use of radiation-related interventions increases the risk of occupational radiation exposure. The dose of occupational radiation received by healthcare workers in interventional pulmonology is usually insufficiently high to cause acute adverse reactions. Therefore, the hazards of chronic adverse reactions are often neglected, and healthcare workers frequently ignore recommendations for personal protection."

The severity of nonstochastic effects varies with changes in the radiation dose, and a dose threshold exists. The 2007 'Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection' (ICRP) proposed that occupational radiation exposure should be limited to ≤ 20 mSv/year (2). The stochastic effects include carcinogenic and genetic effects, and the probability of occurrence (but not the severity) is related to the dose level. Zielinski et al. (3) conducted a long-term follow-up study of 67,562 medical workers who had been exposed to chronic low-dose ionizing radiation between 1951 and 1987. They observed 1,309 cases of cancer. The mean annual exposure among cancer patients between 1951 and 1970 was 1.14 mSv/year, and between 1971 and 1987, it was 0.36 mSv/year. The incidence of thyroid cancer was significantly elevated, and the incidence of liver cancer was significantly elevated among females, which implies that low-dose ionizing radiation increases the incidence of cancer."

X-ray imaging techniques can be used to  aid  certain  flexible  bronchoscopy procedures. For example, the application of X-ray-guided localization in the biopsy of peripheral lung lesions can significantly enhance the rate of positive diagnosis. However, it also exposes healthcare workers to X-rays. Steinfort et al. (4) calculated the radiation dose received by patients and healthcare workers during 45 ultrasound bronchoscopies with fluoroscopic guidance. Their results showed that for each session of ultrasound bronchoscopy with fluoroscopic guidance (median fluoroscopic screening time: 96±55 s), the patient received a median radiation dose of 0.49±0.37 mSv. The effective radiation dose received through protective garments was attenuated to 0.4 µSv for the operator and 0.2 µSv for the assistant. Katsurada et al. (5) calculated the radiation dose received by healthcare workers over 132 cases of endobronchial ultrasonography with a guide sheath under X-ray guidance (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-GS). The results showed that in a procedure with a median radiation time of 7.6 min, the operator received a median radiation dose of 12 µSv.

However, it  increases the radiation exposure of the operator. Buls et al.

Among 46 patients who underwent a biopsy, the median entrance skin dose was 380 mSv; for 18 cases of breast tissue biopsy, the median entrance skin dose of the healthcare workers was 0.174 mSv.

Currently, 125 I and 192 Ir are the most commonly used radioactive particles. 125 I releases γ -rays, and 192 Ir releases β - and γ -rays. Zhuo et  al. (7) performed CT-guided 125 I  implantation in 20 patients with malignant tumors and monitored the radiation dose. The 125 I source intensity was 2.2×10 7 -3.3×10 7 Bq, and an average of 19.65 particles were implanted per patient. The radiation dose was measured immediately after and 2, 4, and 6 months after surgery, and those values were compared to the natural background radiation dose. The results showed that the radiation dose decreased rapidly with increasing distance; at a distance of 50 cm, the detected dose was similar to the natural background radiation dose (10.2-10.8 µSv/h). The mean radiation dose detected immediately after surgery was 60.38±31.92 µSv/h at the body surface and 10.64±0.51 µSv/h at 50 cm; the mean radiation dose detected at the body surface after 6 months was 12.31±4.05 µSv/h.

When the temperature reaches 100 ℃ ,  water within tissue boils and begins to vaporize and produce smoke (9). The high-frequency electric knife uses the thermal effects generated by passing a highfrequency electric current through the tissue, which causes the explosive vaporization of tissues under the electrode. This results in the formation of flat, narrow, non-bleeding incisions a few millimeters deep. Different thermal effects can be generated using the electric knife by controlling the electric current.

Overexposure to CO causes headaches, nausea, emesis, and heart arrhythmia, and may further damage cardiovascular function in patients with cardiovascular disease (14). Acrylonitrile is a colorless volatile liquid with a pungent odor. It is highly toxic and can easily be absorbed by the skin and lungs. Animal studies have shown that repeated or long-term exposure to acrylonitrile can cause mucosal inflammation, cancer, and other health problems (13). Exposure to benzene can trigger nausea and headaches, while long-term exposure can result in hematopoietic disorders, which may cause anemia or even lymphomas (10)."

The victim usually experiences a sudden and severe disturbance of vision in one eye preceded by a visible flash of bright colored light and an audible pop without pain. The subsequent clinical course can be characterized by marked improvement during a period of a few days to weeks, mainly due to clearing of hemorrhage and subsidence of inflammation at the site of injury (19). Shum et  al. (20)  reported the case of a 31-year-old beauty parlor aesthetician who was operating an Nd:YAG cosmetic laser machine of 1,064 nm wavelength with the probe held in the opposite direction when on firing, the laser shot fired into her left eye. The patient heard a 'pop' sound and immediately saw floaters and experienced blurring of vision. Optical coherence tomography taken over the injured area during a 6-week follow-up showed thickened retina and preretinal hyperreflectivities.  Humphrey's visual field showed a dense scotoma emanating from the blind spot. Eventually, scarring occurred at the lesion site, and the patient's vision recovered."

The exposure limit to N2O as a waste anesthetic gas recommended by NIOSH is 25 ppm (46 mg/m 3 ) (37). N2O primarily produces its effects via inhalation. At high concentrations, N2O causes asphyxiation; at low concentrations, it affects the central nervous system, cardiovascular system, liver, hematopoietic system, and reproductive system (38). An N 2 O concentration of 50-67% (500,000-670,000 ppm) is used to induce anesthesia. Studies of dentists and assistants have reported that long-term occupational exposure to N 2 O can result in limb numbness, difficulty concentrating, abnormal sensations, and impaired balance (38)."

            "text": "Although there are currently no studies related to the measurement and investigation of cryogen waste gases produced during bronchoscopic cryotherapy, it is still necessary to implement protective measures to reduce the occupational exposure to N 2 O, such as the installation of waste gas evacuators, use of diluters, and use of personal protection. Currently, bronchoscopy rooms are usually connected to evacuators that dispose of cryogen waste gases, thereby reducing their indoor concentrations. However, the effects on outdoor air pollution and the risks to the outdoor population require further investigation. CO 2 , which is less costly and safer, may be used to avoid occupational N 2O exposure."

This topic urgently requires the continued collaboration of healthcare workers in interventional pulmonology, with reference to interventional medicine in other disciplines, to conduct additional research to establish standards for occupational exposure, hazards, and protection in interventional pulmonology."

In addition, during computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous lung biopsy, CT-guided radioactive particle implantation, and high-dose rate endobronchial brachytherapy, healthcare workers are inevitably exposed to ionizing radiation such as X-rays and the β - and γ -rays produced by radioactive particles like 125 I.  The long-term use of radiation-related interventions increases the risk of occupational radiation exposure. The dose of occupational radiation received by healthcare workers in interventional pulmonology is usually insufficiently high to cause acute adverse reactions. Therefore, the hazards of chronic adverse reactions are often neglected, and healthcare workers frequently ignore recommendations for personal protection.",

The severity of nonstochastic effects varies with changes in the radiation dose, and a dose threshold exists. The 2007 'Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection' (ICRP) proposed that occupational radiation exposure should be limited to ≤ 20 mSv/year (2). The stochastic effects include carcinogenic and genetic effects, and the probability of occurrence (but not the severity) is related to the dose level. Zielinski et al. (3) conducted a long-term follow-up study of 67,562 medical workers who had been exposed to chronic low-dose ionizing radiation between 1951 and 1987. They observed 1,309 cases of cancer. The mean annual exposure among cancer patients between 1951 and 1970 was 1.14 mSv/year, and between 1971 and 1987, it was 0.36 mSv/year. The incidence of thyroid cancer was significantly elevated, and the incidence of liver cancer was significantly elevated among females, which implies that low-dose ionizing radiation increases the incidence of cancer.",

          "article implantation also has several advantages: it is minimally invasive, offers accurate target irradiation, and does not increase lung tissue damage. Implantation methods include CT-guided radioactive particle implantation and high dose rate endobronchial brachytherapy. Currently, 125 I and 192 Ir are the most commonly used radioactive particles. 125 I releases γ -rays, and 192 Ir releases β - and γ -rays. Zhuo et  al. (7) performed CT-guided 125 I  implantation in 20 patients with malignant tumors and monitored the radiation dose. The 125 I source intensity was 2.2×10 7 -3.3×10 7 Bq, and an average of 19.65 particles were implanted per patient. The radiation dose was measured immediately after and 2, 4, and 6 months after surgery, and those values were compared to the natural background radiation dose. The results showed that the radiation dose decreased rapidly with increasing distance; at a distance of 50 cm, the detected dose was similar to the natural background radiation dose (10.2-10.8 µSv/h). The mean radiation dose detected immediately after surgery was 60.38±31.92 µSv/h at the body surface and 10.64±0.51 µSv/h at 50 cm; the mean radiation dose detected at the body surface after 6 months was 12.31±4.05 µSv/h. Hence, the radiation dose attenuated with time, and the dose detected at the body surface after 6 months was close to the natural background dose.",

The smoke produced from laser treatments contains particles with an average diameter of 0.3 µm, whereas electrocautery smoke can contain particles with an average diameter of <0.1 µm (10). It was recently determined that electrocautery and argon plasma coagulation induced the production of a high concentration (>100,000 cm -3 )  of particles ranging from 10 nm to 1 µm in diameter. These can be directly inhaled by healthcare workers and invade the alveoli, which may be hazardous to human health (11).",
