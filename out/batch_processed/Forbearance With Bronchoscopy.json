    "abstract": "FB is a relatively safe procedure, yet like other invasive procedures, the ability to perform should not translate into the necessity to perform. It can be considered in clinical scenarios in which a high diagnostic yield is anticipated. Alternative modalities of investigation should be sought when the pretest probability of diagnostic yield from bronchoscopy is low. The operator should be well versed with indications, contraindications, diagnostic yield alternatives, and the relative cost of the procedure. Vascular endothelial growth factor D is a biomarker that is emerging as a promising diagnostic tool for lymphangioleiomyomatosis, a destructive lung disease. 100,101 Several biomarkers are currently under study to detect various types of rejection in patients with lung transplants. Cylex Immune Cell Function Assay (ImmuKnow; Cylex, Inc) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration and is being studied for use in lung transplant rejections. 102 The utility of these biomarkers as a /uniFB01 rst-line investigation will increase exponentially for better classifying phenotypes and diagnosing several diseases, such as lymphangioleiomyomatosis and acute rejection in lung transplant. However, bronchoscopy and TBBx remain standard practice because of their high yield. Financial/non /uniFB01 nancial disclosures: None declared",

Its indications as a diagnostic as well as a therapeutic tool continue to expand at a rapid pace. This growth also has led to the emergence of a new subspecialty of interventional pulmonology and more than 40 fellowship training programs. However, with increasing popularity and accessibility, there is a high impetus for performing the procedure when it may be of limited value. On the basis of a literature review and our own experience, we produced a list of conditions for which bronchoscopy is of limited value yet is being performed frequently. Conditions such as idiopathic pulmonary /uniFB01 brosis, massive hemoptysis, cystic /uniFB01 brosis, smear-negative pulmonary TB, and stage I sarcoidosis may be approached best in a more prudent fashion, with the bronchoscopic approach reserved for exceptional cases. We present an overview of conditions for which the expectations for bronchoscopy exceed the evidence in the literature, and we coined the term ' forbearance with bronchoscopy ' for situations in which this popular tool may not be the most appropriate initial approach.

        "abstract": "Diagnostic bronchoscopy has undergone two major paradigm shifts in the last 40 years. First, the advent of flexible bronchoscopy gave chest physicians improved access to the tracheobronchial tree with a rapid learning curve and greater patient comfort compared with rigid bronchoscopy. The second paradigm shift has evolved over the last 5 years with the proliferation of new technologies that have significantly enhanced the diagnostic capabilities of flexible bronchoscopy compared with traditional methods. At the forefront of these new technologies is endobronchial ultrasound. In its various forms, endobronchial ultrasound has improved diagnostic yield for pulmonary masses, nodules, intrathoracic adenopathy, and disease extent, thereby reducing the need for more invasive surgical interventions. Various navigational bronchoscopy systems have become available to increase flexible bronchoscope access to small peripheral pulmonary lesions. Furthermore, various modalities of airway assessment, including optical microscopic imaging technologies, may play significant roles in the diagnosis of a variety of pulmonary diseases in the future. Finally, the combination of new diagnostic bronchoscopy technologies and novel approaches in molecular analysis and biomarker assessment hold promise for enhanced diagnosis and personalized management of many pulmonary disorders. In this review, we provide a contemporary review of diagnostic bronchoscopy developments over the past decade."

        "abstract": "The era of bronchoscopy began with Gustav Killian in 1876 when he removed a pork bone from a farmer's airway, using an esophagoscope. Prompted by this accomplishment, Chevalier Jackson, an American otolaryngologist, laid the platform for the modern-day rigid bronchoscope in the early twentieth century. In 1967 Shigeto Ikeda revolutionized the field of bronchoscopy by his innovation of the fiberoptic bronchoscope. Today, bronchoscopy and interventional pulmonology have become an integral part of pulmonary medicine and an established subspecialty. Numerous innovators have furthered the horizons of this technology. In the early 1980s Ko-Pen Wang introduced transbronchial needle aspiration to sample mediastinal lesions while Jean-Fran&#xe7;ois Dumon developed methods for laser photoresection and for placing stents thorough the bronchoscope. More recently, application of endobronchial ultrasound and electromagnetic navigation tools has further galvanized the role of bronchoscopy. The success of lung transplantation also belongs in part to flexible bronchoscopy. Today, researchers are looking into treating emphysema as well as asthma, using bronchoscopic techniques. We believe 2015 is a good time to look back on the history of bronchoscopy and to recognize its major milestones. This article attempts to connect the historical dots in this field of research, with the hope that our effort helps future generations improve the welfare of patients with lung ailments."

        "abstract": "The field of diagnostic bronchoscopy has been revolutionized in the last decade primarily with the advent of endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) but also with the addition of multiple different techniques for \"guided-bronchoscopy\". These advances have had a substantial impact in the management of lung cancer with bronchoscopy now providing both diagnosis and mediastinal staging in a single procedure. EBUS has, in fact, become the first choice for staging of the mediastinum over cervical mediastinoscopy (CM). Although EBUS is now a well-established technique, there are continuous efforts from the scientific community to improve its diagnostic performance, and these will be reviewed in this manuscript. The term \"guided-bronchoscopy\" was recently coined to describe a myriad of techniques that guide our bronchoscopes or bronchoscopic tools into the periphery of the lungs in addition to our conventional fluoroscopy. Electromagnetic and non-electromagnetic navigation, thin and ultrathin scopes, as well as radial-probe EBUS have collectively increased our yield for smaller peripheral lung lesions and continue to evolve. Despite this improved diagnostic yield, there is still ample room for improvement and newer techniques are under way. With new therapies available for patients with interstitial lung disease, achieving a specific histologic diagnosis is now of paramount importance. Given the high morbidity and mortality of surgical biopsies, bronchoscopic cryobiopsy is being rapidly adopted as a safer and effective alternative, and it is likely going to play a major role in the management of these diseases in the near future. This manuscript we will focus on recent advances in EBUS, guided-bronchoscopy, and the use of cryobiopsy."

        "abstract": "The present authors hypothesised that bronchoscopy with protected specimen brush may sample biofilm-forming bacteria adherent to the airway wall, whereas traditional sputum collection may not. Pseudomonas aeruginosa obtained from sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage and protected brush, taken from the right upper lung bronchus of 12 adult patients with cystic fibrosis, were compared. Retrieved bacteria were genotyped, and grown in planktonic cultures and as biofilms, and susceptibilities to individual antibiotics and to antibiotic combinations were determined. Bacterial cultures obtained using bronchoscopy did not yield any new strains of bacteria that were not also found in sputum. A total of 10 patients (83%) had a single strain of P. aeruginosa found using sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage and protected brush techniques, and two patients (17%) had two strains recovered in sputum, but only one strain was recovered using bronchoscopic techniques. Susceptibility to single antibiotics and to antibiotic combinations were not different between planktonically or biofilm-grown bacteria derived from sputum, as compared to those obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage and protected brush. In conclusion, sputum collection provides as much information as bronchoscopy for characterising the genotype and antibiotic susceptibility of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in patients with stable cystic fibrosis."

In a subgroup of patients, atelectasis is resistant to medical therapy, and its persistence in the pediatric population is associated with a poor prognosis. Bronchoscopic instillation of human recombinant DNase expanded atelectatic lobes in three children resistant to at least 2 weeks of medical therapy. This method of administration of DNase has been successful in resistant cases of lobar atelectasis in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, quadriplegia, and status asthmaticus. Purulent cystic fibrosis sputum has a very high DNA content, and DNA has been shown to become more pourable in vitro when treated with rhDNase. Bronchoscopic instillation of rhDNase should be considered in cases of persistent lobar atelectasis unresponsive to medical therapy."

Bronchial biopsy provided the diagnosis in 9 out of 30 patients. Brush smears were positive in 28 patients, being the only positive sample in ten cases. A high yield from brush smears was obtained due to their preparation from caseous material wherever visible in the bronchi. With these results a rapid diagnosis was established in 36 of the 50 patients. When culture results were available, a definite diagnosis of tuberculosis was made in 45 of the patients. The yield from brush smears was found to be significantly better when compared to bronchial aspirate smears (p less than 0.01) and post-bronchoscopic sputum smears (p less than 0.01)."

Fibreoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) has been widely recommended as the diagnostic procedure of choice in smear negative patients. But bronchoscopy is an invasive procedure, costly, not readily available in our country and needs expertise. Several studies abroad have directly compared the yield of sputum induction (SI) with 3% saline (NaCl solution) with Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) through FOB in smear-negative suspected PTB patients and showed that SI was a low cost, safe and well tolerated procedure with equal efficacy to BAL through FOB for the diagnosis of PTB in such patients. For the first time a prospective comparison was conducted in Bangladesh to see the yield of sputum induction (SI) and BAL in 52 selected smear- negative patients of suspected PTB. Each of the samples of induced sputum and BAL fluid were examined for AFB by Ziehl-Neelsen's method. Samples of both SI and BAL from 20 patients were cultured for AFB in Lowenstein-Jensen medium for 6 weeks irrespective of their induced sputum smear being positive or negative for AFB. Data were managed and analyzed using computer program SPSS version 10.0. Agreement of SI and BAL was tested using Pearson Chi-square and Kappa test. The results showed that the yield of SI were significantly more than that of BAL (p&lt;0.05).The AFB smear results from specimens obtained by SI and BAL were in agreement in 75% cases (p=0.02).Statistical analysis of the yield of culture results from SI and BAL group with Fishers Exact test showed they were in agreement in 90% cases (p=0.0001) and was measured by Kappa test as significant (p=0.0004). The sensitivity of AFB-smears in samples from SI and BAL were 74% and 58% respectively. The specificity of smear positivity and of culture was assumed to be 100%. SI is a safe procedure with considerable diagnostic yield and a high agreement with the results of BAL through FOB for the diagnosis of PTB. SI offers an alternative or additional approach to the diagnosis of smear-negative suspected PTB patients and would enhance sensitivity for the diagnosis of tuberculosis."

Since then, NAA testing has become a routine procedure in many settings because NAA tests can reliably detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria in specimens 1 or more weeks earlier than culture. Earlier laboratory confirmation of TB can lead to earlier treatment initiation, improved patient outcomes, increased opportunities to interrupt transmission, and more effective public health interventions. Because of the increasing use of NAA tests and the potential impact on patient care and public health, in June 2008, CDC and the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) convened a panel of clinicians, laboratorians, and TB control officials to assess existing guidelines and make recommendations for using NAA tests for laboratory confirmation of TB. On the basis of the panel's report and consultations with the Advisory Council for the Elimination of TB (ACET),* CDC recommends that NAA testing be performed on at least one respiratory specimen from each patient with signs and symptoms of pulmonary TB for whom a diagnosis of TB is being considered but has not yet been established, and for whom the test result would alter case management or TB control activities, such as contact investigations. These guidelines update the previously published guidelines."

        "abstract": "We performed the first studies of analytic sensitivity, analytic specificity, and dynamic range for the new Xpert MTB/RIF assay, a nucleic acid amplification-based diagnostic system that detects Mycobacterium tuberculosis and rifampin (RIF) resistance in under 2 h. The sensitivity of the assay was tested with 79 phylogenetically and geographically diverse M. tuberculosis isolates, including 42 drug-susceptible isolates and 37 RIF-resistant isolates containing 13 different rpoB mutations or mutation combinations. The specificity of the assay was tested with 89 nontuberculosis bacteria, fungi, and viruses. The Xpert MTB/RIF assay correctly identified all 79 M. tuberculosis isolates and correctly excluded all 89 nontuberculosis isolates. RIF resistance was correctly identified in all 37 resistant isolates and in none of the 42 susceptible isolates. Dynamic range was assessed by adding 10(2) to 10(7) CFU of M. tuberculosis into M. tuberculosis-negative sputum samples. The assay showed a log-linear relationship between cycle threshold and input CFU over the entire concentration range. Resistance detection in the presence of different mixtures of RIF-resistant and RIF-susceptible DNA was assessed. Resistance detection was dependent on the particular mutation and required between 65% and 100% mutant DNA to be present in the sample for 95% certainty of resistance detection. Finally, we studied whether assay specificity could be affected by cross-contaminating amplicons generated by the GenoType MTBDRplus assay. M. tuberculosis was not detected until at least 10(8) copies of an MTBDRplus amplicon were spiked into 1 ml of sputum, suggesting that false-positive results would be unlikely to occur."

These aerosols have a potential for the transmission of tuberculosis and other infections. The follow-up of tuberculin skin test status among staff with exposure to this millieu was observed in hope of delineating whether a significant problem does exist. A questionnaire survey of tuberculin skin test status of graduating pulmonary fellows was performed. Graduating Infectious Disease Fellows formed the control group. Training programs situated in the top 25 cities for tuberculosis in 1983 were chosen if the Fellows spent a major proportion of their time in a large receiving/public hospital. The data returned were analyzed if the individual programs had both Pulmonary and Infectious Disease Fellows in training. Fourteen training programs supplied usable data over a 3-yr period. Seven of 62 (11%) of Pulmonary Fellows at risk converted their tuberculin skin test as opposed to one of 42 (2.4%) of Infectious Disease Fellows. This observation raises concern that more fastidious precautions are needed to isolate patients under these conditions of respiratory aerosol generation. The available armamentarium of nonrecirculated fresh air ventilation and ultraviolet light irradiation in addition to simply wearing face masks should be increasingly utilized. Further studies are warranted to substantiate the applicability of these measures to the current situation."

It is usually a self-limiting event but in fewer than 5% of cases it may be massive, representing a life-threatening condition that warrants urgent investigations and treatment. This article aims to provide a comprehensive literature review on hemoptysis, analyzing its causes and pathophysiologic mechanisms, and providing details about anatomy and imaging of systemic bronchial and nonbronchial arteries responsible for hemoptysis. Strengths and limits of chest radiography, bronchoscopy, multidetector computed tomography (MDCT), MDCT angiography and digital subtraction angiography to assess the cause and lead the treatment of hemoptysis were reported, with particular emphasis on MDCT angiography. Treatment options for recurrent or massive hemoptysis were summarized, highlighting the predominant role of bronchial artery embolization. Finally, a guide was proposed for managing massive and nonmassive hemoptysis, according to the most recent medical literature."

No significant differences between groups with regard to restoration of volume loss were detected after the first treatment intervention, at 24 or at 48 hours (P greater than 0.20). Specifically, the mean percentage resolution of volume loss immediately after bronchoscopy (38 per cent) closely approximated that after the first respiratory therapy treatment in subjects who had not undergone bronchoscopy (37 per cent). An air bronchogram proved to be a predictor of delayed resolution for both groups. At 24 hours, 26 per cent of the air bronchograms demonstrated 83 per cent resolution (P less than 0.001). These results suggest that fiberoptic bronchoscopy does not add to respiratory therapy in the treatment of acute lobar atelectasis and that an air bronchogram predicts delayed resolution of collapse."

Malignant airway obstruction usually results from direct involvement of bronchogenic carcinoma, or by extension of carcinomas occurring in the esophagus or the thyroid. External compression from lymph nodes or metastatic disease from other organs can also cause central airway obstruction. Most malignant airway lesions are surgically inoperable due to advanced disease stage and require multimodality palliation, including stent placement. As with any other medical device, stents have significantly evolved over the last 50 years and deserve an in-depth understanding of their true capabilities and complications. Not every silicone stent is created equal and the same holds for metallic stents. Herein, we present an overview of the topic as well as some of the more practical and controversial issues surrounding airway stents. We also try to dispel the myths surrounding stent removal and their supposed use only in central airways. At the end, we come to the long-held conclusion that stents should not be used as first line treatment of choice, but after ruling out the possibility of curative surgical resection or repair."

Thoracic computed tomography scans and ultrasound are helpful in distinguishing malignant from benign effusions. Pleural fluid cytology is diagnostic in about 60% of cases. In cytology-negative disease, pleural biopsies are helpful. Current management is palliative. Previously, first-line treatment for recurrent symptomatic malignant pleural effusion was chest drain insertion and talc pleurodesis, with indwelling pleural catheter insertion reserved for patients with trapped lung or failed talc pleurodesis. However, catheter insertion is an increasingly acceptable first-line treatment."

It represents the current state of knowledge regarding idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and contains sections on definition and epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis, natural history, staging and prognosis, treatment, and monitoring disease course. For the diagnosis and treatment sections, pragmatic GRADE evidence-based methodology was applied in a question-based format. For each diagnosis and treatment question, the committee graded the quality of the evidence available (high, moderate, low, or very low), and made a recommendation (yes or no, strong or weak). Recommendations were based on majority vote. It is emphasized that clinicians must spend adequate time with patients to discuss patients' values and preferences and decide on the appropriate course of action."

        "abstract": "Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the most prevalent idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, is associated with a poor prognosis. An accurate diagnosis of IPF is essential for optimal management. The recent ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT recommendations on the diagnosis and management of IPF were developed from a systematic review of the published literature. High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scanning has a central role in the IPF diagnostic pathway with formal designation of criteria for an HRCT pattern of UIP. In the correct clinical context, a UIP pattern on HRCT is indicative of a definite diagnosis of IPF without the need for a surgical lung biopsy. However, although the 2011 ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT statement is a major advance, the application of guideline recommendations by clinicians has identified limitations that need to be addressed in future statements. Key problems include: 1) the lack of management recommendations for the highly prevalent clinical scenarios of probable and possible IPF; 2) the ongoing confusion about the diagnostic role of bronchoalveolar lavage (reflecting ambiguity in the current recommendation); 3) HRCT misdiagnosis by less experienced radiologists, increasingly recognised as a major problem; and 4) the lack of integration of clinical data, including the treated course of disease, in the designation of the diagnostic likelihood of IPF."

Some investigators have suggested that these parameters can be used to distinguish sarcoidosis from other types of interstitial lung disease with a high degree of reliability. However, we hypothesized that the BAL CD4/CD8 ratio measured during the initial diagnostic evaluation of patients with biopsy-proven sarcoidosis is highly variable. BAL lymphocytes were analysed via flow cytometry to determine the CD4/CD8 ratio in a population of 86 patients with histological and clinical evidence of sarcoidosis, who underwent BAL as part of their initial diagnostic evaluation. In these patients, the CD4/CD8 ratio ranged 0.5-37.3, with a median value of 3.35 (mean 6.49). The CD4/CD8 ratio was greater than 4 in only 36 (42%) subjects. Ten patients (12%) had a CD4/CD8 ratio less than 1. The distribution of CD4/CD8 ratios was similar in the presence or absence of BAL lymphocytosis. In conclusion, the CD4/CD8 ratio in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is highly variable in biopsy-proven sarcoidosis. Bronchoalveolar lavage lymphocyte subset determination is a diagnostic test with low sensitivity for this disease."

Several independent groups found almost identical predictive values of the CD4:CD8 ratio in BAL for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. A CD4:CD8 ratio greater than 3.5 shows a high specificity of 93 to 96% for sarcoidosis, but the sensitivity is low (53 to 59%). EBUS-TBNA is a safe and useful tool for diagnosing sarcoidosis stage I and II with a sensitivity of 83 to 93% and a specificity of 100%. Novel imaging techniques have been explored, such as PET using L-[3- (18)F] fluoro-alpha-methyltyrosine ( (18)F-F MT), which is more specific for malignancy than (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( (18)F-FDG)-PET. The combined modality of FMT-PET with FDG-PET could successfully discriminate sarcoidosis from malignancy. These recent developments including novel biopsy procedures and novel imaging techniques could be of value to diagnosing sarcoidosis."

Better treatments for and earlier detection of heart failure are needed if the situation to improve. However, even this may not be enough. The dramatic deterioration in quality of life and prognosis when a patient progresses from asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction to overt heart failure suggests that only a programme of screening and prevention will effectively reduce the public health burden of heart failure. Moreover, the economic consequences of developing overt heart failure suggest that such an approach is likely to be cost-effective."

Thirty-one consecutive patients with subacute left heart failure underwent a clinical evaluation using the NYHA classification, a CT examination, and transthoracic echocardiography at the time of initial presentation (T1). After initiation of medical treatment (T2), follow-up CT scans were systematically obtained together with a clinical evaluation. At T1, all patients showed severe (type III: n=12, 39%; type IV: n=12, 39%) to moderate (type I, n=1, 3%; type II, n=6, 19%) dyspnea with a mean ejection fraction of 39% (range 22-74%). On initial CT scans, enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes were seen in 13 patients (42%) with blurred contours in 5 patients (16%) and hazy mediastinal fat in 1 patient (3%). Significant decrease in the size of lymphadenopathy was observed between T1 and T2 (T1, n=13, 42% vs T2, n=10, 32%; p&lt;0.05) with a concurrent decrease in the severity of dyspnea (grade III-IV dyspnea at T1, n=24, 78% vs grade I-II dyspnea at T2, n=26, 83.5%). Patients with enlarged lymph nodes at T1 showed: (a) a significantly lower ejection fraction at echocardiography than those without lymphadenopathy (mean+/-SD value: 34+/-12.9 vs 43+/-13.8%; p=0.04); (b) a significantly larger diameter of the right superior pulmonary vein (mean+/-SD value: 17+/-2.75 vs 14+/-3.9 mm; p=0.04); and (c) a higher frequency of abnormal peribronchovascular thickening ( n=5 vs n=1; p=0.06). Mediastinal lymphadenopathy associated with subacute left heart failure was observed in 13 patients (42%), showing regression after initiation of treatment in 8 of 13 patients (62%)."

A review was done of all patients referred for real-time EBUS-TBNA over an 18-month period at our institution. Cytological analysis of EBUS-TBNA aspirates was compared with a reference standard of definitive pathologic tissue diagnosis or a composite of &#x2265;6 months' clinical follow-up with radiographic imaging. Adequate tissue was obtained in 225/236 procedures (95.3%) and a reference standard was available in 214. The overall diagnostic yield of EBUS-TBNA in those procedures with a reference standard was 87.4%. The sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of EBUS-TBNA for malignancy was 86.1%, 100% and 92.9%, respectively. The sampling accuracy of EBUS-TBNA decreased with lymph node size &#x2264;5&#x2009;mm and with paratracheal location. Other factors, such as airway distortion and calcification, are also associated with less accurate EBUS-TBNA results. In a diverse population of patients with suspected cancer or recurrence, EBUS-TBNA is minimally invasive and highly accurate. Factors such as lymph node size and location influence the result of EBUS-TBNA."

Compared to other endoscopic procedures, the risk of morbidity and mortality from the bleeding is increased, as even a small amount of blood can fill the tracheobronchial tree and lead to respiratory failure. Patients using antithrombotic agents (ATAs) have higher bleeding risk. A thorough understanding of the different ATAs is critical to manage patients during the peri-procedural period. A decision to stop an ATA before bronchoscopy should take into account a variety of factors, including indication for its use and the type of procedure. This article serves as a detailed review on the different ATAs, their pharmacokinetics and the pre- and post-bronchoscopy management of patients receiving these medications."

        "abstract": "Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a destructive lung disease affecting primarily women. LAM is caused by inactivating mutations in the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) genes, resulting in hyperactivation of mechanistic/mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Over the past five years, there have been remarkable advances in the diagnosis and therapy of LAM, including the identification of vascular endothelial growth factor D (VEGF-D) as a diagnostic biomarker and the US Food and Drug Administration approval of sirolimus as therapy for LAM. In appropriate clinical situations VEGF-D testing can make lung biopsy unnecessary to diagnose LAM. However, there remains an urgent unmet need for additional biomarkers of disease activity and/or response to therapy. Areas covered: This work reviews VEGF-D, an established LAM biomarker, and discusses emerging biomarkers, including circulating LAM cells, imaging, lipid, and metabolite biomarkers, focusing on those with the highest potential impact for LAM patients. Expert commentary: Ongoing research priorities include the development of validated biomarkers to 1) noninvasively diagnose LAM in women whose VEGF-D levels are not diagnostic, 2) accurately predict the likelihood of disease progression and 3) quantitatively measure disease activity and LAM cell burden. These biomarkers would enable personalized, precision clinical care and fast-track clinical trial implementation, with high clinical impact."

        "abstract": "Immunologic complications after lung transplantation (LT) include acute cellular rejection (ACR), antibody-mediated rejection (AMR), and most forms of chronic allograft dysfunction (CAD). ACR is an inflammatory process in which the reaction is mediated by the T-cell population. Most episodes of ACR fully recover with treatment, but repeated bouts are considered to be a risk factor for CAD. Biomarker cytokines interleukin (IL)-10, IL-15, IL-6, CCL5, CCR2 and IFN&#x3b3; may play significant roles in this complication. Formerly bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) or chronic rejection or most forms of CAD were considered to be immunologic complications not amenable therapeutic measures. CAD, the main limitation for long-term survival in LT, is characterized histologically by airway epithelial cell apoptosis and luminal fibrosis in the respiratory bronchioles causing airflow obstruction and, in some cases, lung parenchymal affectations causing restrictive lung disease. Several biomarkers have been studied in CAD, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, IL-23, IL-13, IFN &#x3b3;, and TGF &#x3b2; cytokines, pH, bile acid, and tripsine of gastroesophageal reflux and toll-like receptors of innate immunity. Herein we have reviewed the literature of biomarkers involved in lung rejection."

Similarly, up to 18% of patients with PAH can have mediastinal lymphadenopathy. 83 This adenopathy often resolves with appropriate treatment. Keeping in mind the clinical context and nonmalignant nature of mediastinal lymphadenopathy, an attempt to obtain tissue in such cases would be of low diagnostic value.
