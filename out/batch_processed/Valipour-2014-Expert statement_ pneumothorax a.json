[8] showed that a part of the volume reduction in the target lobe is redistributed to the ipsilateral lobe, with only a small portion redistributed to the contralateral lung. This result explains why the net reduction in total lung capacity in these patients is modest even with large reductions in the target lobe.

It is hypothesized that postprocedurally the untreated ipsilateral lobe expands to occupy the newly created space in the thoracic cavity. The subsequent shifting of volumes on one side of the lung, which could be rapid in some cases, may be associated with tensioning and in some cases tearing of the already compromised lung tissue. The magnitude of the lobar volume shift, i.e. the proportional size of the target lobe reduction that is shifted to the nontreated ipsilateral lobe, might be a greater risk factor for pneumothorax; however, this hypothesis has not yet been formally tested. Rupture of blebs or bullae in the ipsilateral nontreated lobe is considered the most frequent cause of a pneumothorax   [9] (  fig. 2  ). Another mechanism could be parenchymal rupture as the lobes shift volumes due to preexisting pleural adhesion (  fig. 3  ). All of the above conditions describe a pneumothorax  that  may  result  in  a  bronchopleural  fistula  that could  cause  pneumothorax  expansion  over  time  if  not treated by chest tube insertion. Another less common but potential  manifestation  is  pneumothorax  ex  vacuo.

Finally,  a  pneumothorax might theoretically also originate from the barotrauma response  to  the  acute  volume  reduction  in  the  treated lobe. The absence of a bronchopleural fistula might be due to the valves closing the originating bronchi. These cases of pneumothorax are expected to be associated with a lower volume on X-ray.

The median onset of a pneumothorax was 2 days after the procedure, with a median duration of 11.5 days. The majority of cases resolved either with observation or with the insertion of a chest tube. Importantly, these patients showed substantial reductions in the target lobar volume (65 ± 36%) at follow-up. This is of particular clinical importance as patients with a greater than 50% reduction in target lobar volume demonstrate clinically significant benefits in hyperinflation, exercise capacity, quality of life, and airflow obstruction   [20]  .  The latter report further indicates results comparable to those of LVRS in these patients, with an expected lower morbidity and mortality. Therefore, in terms of patient outcomes, an approach with complete lobar occlusion and a higher risk of pneumothorax appears to be superior to incomplete lobar occlusion   [21]  ."

As the majority of pneumothoraces following valve placement occur within 48 h   [19]  , the authors of this report recommend that patients stay in hospital for at least 2 nights after the procedure for surveillance. It has to be acknowledged, however, that institutional  practices  may  substantially  vary  and  patients might be discharged earlier if stable after the procedure. Thus,  importantly,  physicians  should  inform  their  patients of the potential risk of a pneumothorax after discharge, the symptoms to be aware of, and the information to provide to emergency responders. Patients requiring air travel immediately after discharge might require a longer period of postprocedural observation (up to 5 days)."

Since the valves cause gradual shrinkage of the treated lobe and thereafter only maintain the collapse,  they  may not increase the risk of pneumothorax when the process of lobar volume shift has been completed. Hence, a pneumothorax occurring 3 months after endoscopic  valve  therapy  is  less  likely  to  be  due  to  valve placement. There is limited experience in this category; however, any pneumothorax in patients with emphysema and limited respiratory reserves needs to be considered an  emergency  and  patients  should  be  informed  of  the need to seek medical help when presenting with any signs or symptoms of a pneumothorax regardless of the timing of valve therapy. Ideally, written information sheets with details of the signs and symptoms of a pneumothorax and guidance on how and when to seek medical help should be provided."

        "abstract": "Observational and randomized studies provide convincing evidence that lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) improves symptoms, lung function, exercise tolerance, and life span in well-defined subsets of patients with emphysema. Yet, in the face of an estimated 3 million patients with emphysema in the United States, &lt; 15 LVRS operations are performed monthly under the aegis of Medicare, in part because of misleading reporting in lay and medical publications suggesting that the operation is associated with prohibitive risks and offers minimal benefits. Thus, a treatment with proven potential for palliating and prolonging life may be underutilized. In an attempt to lower risks and cost, several bronchoscopic strategies (bronchoscopic emphysema treatment [BET]) to reduce lung volume have been introduced. The following three methods have been tested in some depth: (1) unidirectional valves that allow exit but bar entry of gas to collapse targeted hyperinflated portions of the lung and reduce overall volume; (2) biologic lung volume reduction (BioLVR) that involves intrabronchial administration of a biocompatible complex to collapse, inflame, scar, and shrink the targeted emphysematous lung; and (3) airway bypass tract (ABT) or creation of stented nonanatomic pathways between hyperinflated pulmonary parenchyma and bronchial tree to decompress and reduce the volume of oversized lung. The results of pilot and randomized pivotal clinical trials suggest that the bronchoscopic strategies are associated with lower mortality and morbidity but are also less efficient than LVRS. Most bronchoscopic approaches improve quality-of-life measures without supportive physiologic or exercise tolerance benefits. Although there is promise of limited therapeutic influence, the available information is not sufficient to recommend use of bronchoscopic strategies for treating emphysema."

The GOLD committee and the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society have published detailed, evidence-based reviews of management approaches, providing stepped-care algorithms for pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapy. Over the past several decades, much effort was spent in designing additional nonpharmacologic approaches to ameliorate symptoms in these patients. Three endoscopic lung volume reduction principles have shown promise and reached later-stage clinical trials in patients with heterogeneous emphysematous diseases. These include so-called blocking devices (valves), nonblocking devices (coils) and irreversible nonblocking techniques (bronchoscopic thermal vapor ablation, polymeric lung volume reduction) designed to collapse and remodel hyperinflated lung. For homogeneous diseases the formation of airway bypass tracts designed to facilitate emptying of damaged lung regions with long expiratory times is being investigated."

COPD patients who develop spontaneous pneumothorax require a more aggressive management of their acute respiratory problem and treatment to prevent recurrences. All patients who have secondary spontaneous pneumothorax should be hospitalized and managed with tube thoracostomy and chest roentgenogram. Patients who have a persistent or large air leak or those who lack parietalto-visceral pleural apposition should undergo VATS early in their hospital stay. During VATS, the leaking bulla should be resected if it can be located, and if not, the most apical bleb should be resected. In addition, pleurodesis along with pleurectomy should be considered in those patients who are safe operative candidates. These techniques help prevent future pneumothoraces from bleb rupture in the patients who have COPD."

        "abstract": "Pneumothorax ex vacuo is a little-known complication of lobar collapse. In this condition, acute bronchial obstruction from mucous plugs, aspirated foreign bodies, or malpositioned endotracheal tubes causes acute lobar collapse and a marked increase in negative intrapleural pressure around the collapsed lobe. As a result, gas is drawn into the pleural space around the collapsed lobe while the seal between the visceral and parietal pleura of the adjacent lobe or lobes remains intact. The pneumothorax spontaneously resolves when the bronchial obstruction is relieved and the lobe reexpands. Recognition of pneumothorax ex vacuo is crucial in directing treatment to relieve the bronchial obstruction rather than inserting a chest tube into the pleural space."
