            "text": "Abstract: The practice of tracheostomy dates to ancient Egyptian times and has undergone a significant evolution in both its popularity and techniques. In its contemporary form, tracheostomy encompasses both surgical and percutaneous approaches. The primary indications for tracheostomy are centered around ensuring a secure airway in the case of airway compromise or the need for prolonged airway support. While there are only a few absolute contraindications for percutaneous dilation tracheostomies (PDT s), the list of relative contraindications is continually being reevaluated as new data emerges. This review article provides an updated review of percutaneous tracheostomy with more recent literature including studies from the pandemic which saw increased use of percutaneous tracheostomies as well as complications from them. Here we additionally reviewed the most recent literature surrounding of optimal timing and continued lack real world data favoring mortality for early intubation despite further randomized controlled trial testing, including neuro-intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Both surgical and percutaneous methods continue to have their roles, but the percutaneous approach is increasingly favored in the right setting due to factors such as smaller incisions, reduced infection risk, and improved bedside convenience and safety data. Over time the PDT technique has undergone various refinements. One widely utilized method involves employing a single dilator. In this review, practical evidence based guidance is included for the performance of the procedure as well as the aftercare."

This technique underwent several revisions until Dr. Ciaglia published the technique of using serial dilators over a J-wire in 1985 (8). Subsequently other derivations of the technique were developed in an attempt to improve the procedure by using a Howard Kelly forceps, a retrogradely passed wire as a track for the dilator, and a single-step screw-type dilator (9-11). Subsequent iterations of the Ciaglia technique evolved to using balloon dilation over a guidewire, and then finally combined the serial dilations into the single conical design 'blue rhino' dilation technique used today."

These include: upper airway obstruction from tumor, surgery, trauma foreign body or infection, prevention of laryngeal and upper airway damage to prolonged mechanical ventilation, long-term airway protection after head injury, or stroke, and maintenance of easy or frequent access to the lower airway for pulmonary toilette (12,13). One notable caveat to these situations involves emergency airway securement, which requires invasive techniques such as cricothyrotomy, or emergent ST. This circumstance notably excludes a conventional percutaneous approach i.e. not involving the cricothyroid membrane (14)."

Literature further supports additional advantages of tracheostomy when compared to endotracheal tubes including fewer orallabial ulcerations, improved oral hygiene, improved airway security and improved patient comfort (16)."

It has traditionally been thought that increased neck adiposity may complicate identification of tissue landmarks and lead to increased adverse events during placement. Recent studies note that while there may be a higher risk for complications in obese individuals, they are only slightly higher than their non-obese counterparts (18,19). However, it is important to note that standard length tracheostomy tubes are often too short in this patient population, and carry their own risks including excessive pressure on the anterior wall and posterior membrane causing tissue damage, accidental decannulation, difficult suctioning, increased patient discomfort and subcutaneous emphysema (if a fenestrated tube used) (20). Therefore, in order to minimize these risks, the selection of an appropriately sized length tracheostomy tube is imperative in obese patients."

Their investigation aimed to discern the impact of early versus late tracheostomy on the incidence of pneumonia in adults undergoing mechanical ventilation within the intensive care unit (ICU). A total of 419 patients, without pulmonary infection as the cause of respiratory failure, were randomly assigned to  receive early tracheostomy (after 6-8 days) or late tracheostomy (after 13-15 days).

However, they did find statistical differences favoring PDT in respect to a smaller size of the incision. With respect to minor perioperative complications (difficult tube placement) and difficult cannula changes prior to 7 days greater in ST were favored (30). Subsequent studies that were culminated in a Cochrane review found that when comparing the two methods, PDT significantly reduced the rate of wound infection, and unfavorable scarring. There was also some signaling, albeit with low quality evidence with non-significant positive effects, favoring PDT for mortality, and rate of serious adverse events (31)."

While patient selection bias resulting in sicker, more complex cases being taken to the operating room for ST could be the reason for these results. The act of an intrahospital transfer is known to carry with it significant risks for physiologic alterations,  and  equipment  failure,  placing  patients at  an  increased risk for adverse events and prolonged hospitalizations (33-36). In addition to safety, PDT has been demonstrated to also reduce cost in comparison to ST. This can largely be attributed to operating room fees, and anesthesia fees (37)."

Procedural personnel must then be identified. In addition to the proceduralist, it is common to have a bronchoscopist who will be able to provide direct endotracheal visualization throughout the procedure, a respiratory therapist to retract and hold the endotracheal tube as well as be able to  assist  with  ventilator  management, and a nurse to administer medications and monitor the patient's vital signs. Medications for sedation and paralysis should be available. Once all team members are ready, the patient should be appropriately positioned with the head and neck extended. This is most often achieved by placing a  towel  roll  underneath  the  patient's  shoulders.  The patient's oxygenation should be optimized and monitored with continuous pulse oximetry. Generally, optimization is  achieved with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 1.0 and a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5-10 cmH2O."

The process generally begins with downsizing to an uncuffed tracheostomy tube and speaking valve trial. At our institution this is done for 24 hours, and if no complications occur, the patient is advanced to a capping trial. During capping trial, patients are required to tolerate capping for 24  hours  prior  to  decannulation.  This  approach  is admittedly conservative, and the results from REDECAP study suggest that by basing decannulation on suctioning needs less than 2 times every 8 hours for a 24-hour period, patient's may undergo decannulation at a faster rate without significant differences in complications (48)."

Despite several randomized trials,  the  optimal timing of performing tracheostomy remains a subject of ongoing scientific debate.
