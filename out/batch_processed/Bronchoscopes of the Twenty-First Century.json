Rigid bronchoscopy with foreign body removal quickly evolved into the treatment of choice in these patients, with a clinical success rate above 98%. 1 During the early 1900s, Killian published extensively and lectured throughout the world. He further went on to adapt his bronchoscopes, laryngoscopes, and endoscopes, and first described techniques, such as using fluoroscopy and radiographs to define endobronchial anatomy. The design and functionality of the rigid bronchoscope was improved further in 1904 when Chevalier Jackson, the ''father of American bronchoesophagology,'' first equipped his bronchoscope with a suction channel and a small light bulb at the distal tip to provide illumination."

With the miniaturization of electronic devices, the first video bronchoscope was introduced in 1987. This development enabled endoscopic pictures to be taken and shared for educational purposes. Another major advance in the teaching of bronchoscopy came when physicians no longer needed to look through an eyepiece, but instead could transmit endoscopic images to monitors, enabling an entire bronchoscopy staff to witness procedures."

The adult rigid bronchoscope is usually 40 cm long and has an external diameter ranging from 9 to 14 mm. The distal end has a beveled tip to enable lifting of the epiglottis and safer insertion through the vocal cords. This beveled end can also be used to dilate stenotic lesions and to ''core'' through tumors, thus achieving rapid airway patency. Fenestrations are present at the distal one third of the bronchoscope to enable contralateral lung ventilation when the bronchoscope is inserted into a mainstem bronchus. In comparison with the bronchoscope, a rigid tracheoscope is shortermeasuring 30 cm-enabling more maneuverability within the trachea to relieve central airway obstructions. Distal fenestrations are absent on the rigid tracheoscope because single lung ventilation is not required while operating within the trachea. The proximal end of the bronchoscope varies by manufacturer as discussed below.

This design may also increase efficiency during procedures because the telescope does not need to be removed before the insertion of accessories. However, the telescope cannot extend distally past the lumen of the bronchoscope and thus vision is limited to only areas at the distal end of the rigid bronchoscope. There is also an irrigation port at the proximal operator end to enable washing of the distal lens for optimal visualization.

In 1967, Sanders 3 developed a method of low-frequency jet ventilation to enable effective ventilation and oxygenation while keeping the proximal end of the bronchoscope free for passage of the instruments. In the 1990s, a shift away from this mode followed reports of hypoxemia during spontaneous assisted ventilation with intravenous anesthesia during rigid bronchoscopy in patients with central airway obstruction. Jet Venturi ventilation reemerged as a favored method. 4 Because the system is open to atmosphere, room air is also entrained into the bronchoscope, resulting in a variable fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2). 5 Although a safe oxyhemoglobin saturation is usually easily obtained, potential downsides to this system are a limited ability to monitor FiO2, minute ventilation, and airway pressures. As such, there is a potential increased risk of iatrogenic pneumothorax due to dynamic hyperinflation distal to a stenotic airway. 6"

Meanwhile, the number of lung cancer deaths continues to increase amongst women in the United States. 8 Bronchoscopy has been an invaluable tool in the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer. Transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) of mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes has been shown to be an effective means of both diagnosing and staging lung cancer. 9-11 The procedure has consistently been shown to be minimally invasive, safe, and less costly than mediastinoscopy. Also, the procedure can preclude surgery in up to 29% of patients. 12 Despite these facts, the procedure remains underused. A survey performed in 1991 showed that only 12% of pulmonologists routinely use TBNA in evaluating malignant disease. This reluctance to use TBNA is likely due to concerns over lack of training, fear of injuring the bronchial tubes or puncturing a blood vessel, and lack of adequate procedural support. 13 Although traditional TBNA is a safe and effective procedure, the inability to directly visualize mediastinal and hilar lymph"

Using a flexible ultrathin bronchoscope and the image guidance, the clinician can gain access to small peripheral nodules. In 2006, Asano and colleagues 23 published the first study in the literature using the technology. By using CT virtual bronchoscopy in conjunction with a computer program that generated a pathway to the lesion and an ultrathin bronchoscope, they were able to advance the bronchoscope into the planned route in 36 of 38 cases (94.7%), with a diagnostic rate of 81.6%. A latter study by the same group combined this technology with radial probe Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and guide-sheath technology. In this study of 31 patients, 32 peripheral pulmonary lesions were evaluated. The newer program was able to produce virtual images out to a seventhorder bronchi.

Recent efforts have been directed at earlier diagnoses with the hope that such malignancies, caught in earlier stages, could be cured without resection or be surgically removed with a higher likelihood of cure. 25 Early detection of preinvasive lesions within the central airways can be achieved with the autofluorescence. 26 By using blue light (520 nm) instead of white light, dysplasia and carcinoma in situ will appear darker than the surrounding normal tissue because of a loss of normal autofluorescence ( Fig. 3 ). There are several autofluorescence devices currently available, including the Laser Induced Fluorescence Endoscope (LIFE) system, the D-Light system, the SAFE-1000 system, and the Autofluorescence Imaging (AFI) system. 27,28 Unfortunately, autofluorescence technology is unable to differentiate between early preinvasive lesions and inflammatory or infectious changes in the epithelium that are benign, thus significantly reducing its specificity. 29 There are several classes of tissue findings in autofluorescence: normal (class I); inflammation and mild dysplasia (class II); and moderate to severe dysplasia, carcinoma in situ, or invasive cancer (class III). 27 To date, this classification does not correlate with degree of invasion or propensity toward a neoplastic process. 30 Because of its poor specificity, and high degree of inter- and intraobserver variability, autofluorescence is not considered an acceptable screening modality, even in high-risk patients, and the utility of this procedure in the lower airway remains in question. 31,32",

Similar to autofluorescence, the device uses a blue laser, which has been adapted within a small probe that can be advanced through the working channel of the bronchoscope into the distal airways and alveoli to induce tissue fluorescence. Optical slices of the observed tissue are obtained and in vivo magnified images of the alveoli can be observed. 37"

The current data within the pulmonary literature remain limited to studies by Thiberville and colleagues. 37 In 2007, their group performed in vivo CFM bronchoscopically on 29 patients at high risk for lung cancer. The investigators recognized several microscopic patterns that may help in the recognition of dysplastic tissue. In 2009, the same group performed confocal fluorescence microscopy in 41 healthy subjects, including 17 active smokers. In vivo acinar microimaging was obtained from multiple lung segments ( Fig. 5 ). The investigators reported that alveolar macrophages were not detectable in nonsmokers, whereas a specific tobacco tar-induced fluorescence was observed in smoking subjects. 38 Although this technology does appear to have promise, given the currently limited data, its accuracy in detecting lung pathology has yet to be defined.",

Minor complications included one adverse reaction to alphaxalone-alphadolone acetate (Althesin), one prolonged episode of laryngeal spasm after removal of the bronchoscope, and subsequent muscle pain attributed to suxamethonium in 36 patients. The last complication occurred significantly less frequently (p less than 0 . 025) in those patients who were pretreated with a small dose of a non-depolarising neuromuscular blocking agent. Serial arterial blood gas sampling in 10 patients showed adequate ventilation during bronchoscopy, but carbon dioxide retention developed in nine cases immediately after the bronchoscope was withdrawn. With adequate precautions, however, the procedure is safe and well tolerated, even in patients with severe impairment of respiratory function."

        "abstract": "Despite its proven usefulness, TBNA is not widely used. An American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) survey showed that only 11.8% of pulmonologists use TBNA. Most pulmonologists in the 1980s were not formally trained in TBNA. This lack of training has unfortunately translated to minimal emphasis on TBNA in current training programs in a large number of institutions. Technical problems with the procedure (faulty site selection, incomplete needle penetration, catheter kinking that prevents adequate suction, etc.), the confusing array of needles, low diagnostic yields, unproven concerns regarding the safety of the procedure, inadequate cytopathology support, and bronchoscopic damage have all perpetuated the image of limited usefulness for this procedure. Limitations to the practice of TBNA are: Lack of training during fellowship Technical inadequacies Lack of cytopathologists trained in TBNA interpretation Fear of bronchoscope damage Safety issues Failure to reproduce published successes Reservations regarding usefulness of TBNA results Hands-on experience with TBNA, developing familiarity and expertise with only a few needles, and paying careful attention to anatomy, procedure techniques, and specimen acquisition may all help to increase yield. The following lists how better results can be obtained with TBNA: Preprocedure Review TBNA instruction tapes Attend hands-on courses Practice with lung models Review patient's CAT scans Familiarize with one-two cytology and histology needle Obtain a trained assistant Procedural Identify target site Needle to airway angle at least greater than 45 degrees Insert entire length of the needle Use scope channel to support the catheter Release suction before withdrawing needle (for staging) Specimen acquisition Avoid delay in preparing slides Adequate sampling (at least two) Use smear method for cytology specimen Analyze all samples flush solutions cell block Postprocedure Find an experienced cytopathologist Review your procedure (by watching video) Review pathology slides Acquisition of skills with cytology needles should precede the use of the histology needle. Increasing education and experience can also increase diagnostic yields. Transbronchial needle aspiration has been proven to be accurate in staging lung cancers, identifying inoperable carcinomas, and diagnosing a variety of lung diseases. Few complications have been encountered and the technique is less invasive and less costly than surgical procedures. Drawing on evidence from published literature, we suggest the following guidelines for TBNA: All patients presenting with mediastinal or hilar adenopathy or both, should have 22-ga and/or 19-ga TBNA as the initial procedure. These procedures would help diagnose malignant and nonmalignant diseases, and stage lung cancers. All patients with evidence of submucosal and peribronchial disease should have 22-ga needle cytology sampling. In patients with visible endobronchial disease, 22-ga TBNA should be optional. In the presence of a necrotic or a hemorrhagic tumor, or in a patient with a bleeding diathesis, TBNA would be helpful. In all patients with Type III and IV peripheral nodules, TBNA should be the initial diagnostic procedure. There remains no doubt about the diagnostic usefulness of TBNA. Guidelines must be developed to ensure that pulmonary fellows are adequately trained in this procedure. Regional workshops with hands-on experience targeted to practicing pulmonologists organized by the ACCP would help popularize the procedure. Initial low yields should not discourage pulmonologists from using the procedure. Collaboration between thoracic surgeons, oncologists, and pulmonary physicians is essential to set up TBNA programs within institutions. With time, as more and more pulmonologists attain expertise in TBNA, the full potential of this nonsurgical, cost-effective, and safe procedure will be realized."

To determine the efficacy and safety of this procedure for staging the extent of mediastinal disease, the results of TBNA performed during fiberoptic bronchoscopy in 39 patients without known extrathoracic metastases were reviewed. Flexible TBNA was found to be a safe, effective method for determining the presence or absence of mediastinal metastases from bronchogenic carcinoma. Furthermore, TBNA results compare favorably with roentgenographic staging techniques, with the added advantage of providing cytopathologic information."

Of 360 individuals determined to have bronchogenic carcinoma, 50 of 81 (62%) with small cell carcinoma (SCC) and 135 of 279 (48%) with non-small cell carcinoma (NSCC) had positive aspirates (p = 0.034). TBNA precluded additional thoracic surgery in a total of 104 of 360 (29%) patients and was exclusively diagnostic of carcinoma in 65 of 360 (18%) cases. Right-sided tumors were more likely to have a positive mediastinal TBNA (p = 0.002 to 0. 01) as were histologic (67 of 118 [57%]) rather than cytology aspirates (228 of 532 [41%]) (p &lt; 0.001). Sensitivity was &gt; 57% in lymph nodes (LN) &gt;/= 10 mm, and among LN of equivalent size, right paratracheal and subcarinal sites were most likely to establish malignancy. Preoperative CT is a valuable adjunct in the staging of CA by TBNA. Increasing LN size, right-sided tumors, right paratracheal and subcarinal locations, use of a histology needle, and the presence of SCC are the best predictors of a positive aspirate."

First, answers to some of the questions, particularly those pertaining to complication rates, rely on the memory of participants. Second, the wording of certain questions may have imparted different meanings. Third, the format of the questionnaire may have confused some. Fourth, one cannot expect that all questionnaires will be answered fully. Fifth, as indicated by several respondents, several important topics (eg, topical anesthetic agents and mode of their delivery, prophylaxis against infective endocarditis, tracheobronchial stent placement, endobronchial intraluminal radiotherapy) were not included. Many respondents suggested inclusion of these and other questions in future surveys. Nevertheless, in the absence of any survey looking into a large number of bronchoscopy-related practices, mail surveys have the advantage of reflecting nationwide practice rather than results from selected centers, and this report provides some insight into bronchoscopy practices in North America. While the results indicate the present trends in bronchoscopy practices in North America, they do not establish or recommend any standards in bronchoscopy."

The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the diagnostic yield of EBUS-TBNA in demonstrating the pathological features of sarcoidosis. In total, 65 patients with suspected sarcoidosis, with enlarged hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes on computed tomography, were included in the study. Patients with a suspected or known malignancy or previously established diagnosis of sarcoidosis were excluded. Convex probe endobronchial ultrasonography integrated with a separate working channel was used for EBUS-TBNA. Surgical methods were performed in those in whom no granulomas were detected by EBUS-TBNA. Patients were followed up clinically. EBUS-TBNA was performed on a total of 77 lymph node stations in 65 patients. A final diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made for 61 (93.8%) of the patients. The remaining four patients were diagnosed as having Wegener's granulomatosis (n=1) or indefinite (n=3). In patients with a final diagnosis of sarcoidosis, EBUS-TBNA demonstrated noncaseating epithelioid cell granulomas in 56 (91.8%) of the patients. No complications were reported. Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration proved to be a safe procedure with a high yield for the diagnoses of sarcoidosis."

        "abstract": "In the past 2 decades, flexible bronchoscopy (FB) with forceps biopsy and transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA); computed tomography (CT)-guided, transthoracic fine-needle aspiration (FNA); and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) have revolutionized lung cancer diagnosis and staging by facilitating precise biopsy of lung lesions and virtually all mediastinal lymph-node stations. In this article the authors present an algorithm for the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer that addresses sampling of suspicious lesions and lymph nodes by means of FB, CT, ultrasonography, fluoroscopy, and EUS, emphasizing tissue-based diagnosis and staging by means of image-guided technology with the highest diagnostic yield. They discuss the approach to the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer by techniques guided by FB, with particular attention to the increasing role of TBNA in this field. Additionally, the authors propose a rating scale based on the degree of invasiveness and diagnostic yield, comparing FB with other diagnostic techniques."

        "abstract": "We developed a bronchoscope insertion guidance system that produces virtual images by extracting the bronchi by automatic threshold adjustment, and searching for the bronchial route to the determined target. We used this system in combination with a thin bronchoscope and endobronchial ultrasonography with a guide sheath (EBUS-GS), and evaluated its practicability, usefulness and safety. The subjects were 31 patients with 32 peripheral pulmonary lesions. Computed tomography (CT) data were transferred into this system, and virtual bronchial images were automatically produced by setting the lesion as the target. While virtual images with the target were displayed for comparison with real images by the system, a thin bronchoscope was advanced to the target bronchus. Transbronchial biopsy (TBB) was then performed by EBUS-GS. The system automatically produced virtual images to a median of fifth- (third- to seventh-) order bronchi. In all patients, the thin bronchoscope could be guided along the planned route, and observation to a median of fifth- (third- to seventh-) order bronchi was possible. Thirty lesions (93.8%) were successfully visualized by EBUS, and 27 (84.4%) could be pathologically diagnosed. In lesions &lt; or =30mm in size, the EBUS visualization yield was 91.7% (22/24), and the diagnostic yield was 79.2% (19/24). The median total examination time was 22.3 (9.8-41.5) min. In summary, using the bronchoscope insertion guidance system, virtual images can be readily produced, and the bronchoscope can be successfully guided to the target. This method is promising as a routine examination method in the biopsy of peripheral pulmonary lesions."

Consecutive patients with atypical or suspicious cells in sputum or bronchial aspirate, no localising abnormality on chest radiography and nondiagnostic white-light bronchoscopic (WLB) results were recruited. WLB and AFB were performed sequentially during the same session. All abnormal areas detected by WLB, AFB or both were sampled and the biopsy specimens sent for histological examination. Sixty-two patients were recruited within the 32-month study period. Seventeen had no endobronchial lesion detected. Among the 45 patients with endobronchial lesions, 37 had lesions with a histopathological grade of mild dysplasia or less; of the eight patients who had a lesion with a histological grade of moderate dysplasia or worse, five were found to have lung cancer, two invasive lung cancer and three an intra-epithelial neoplasm (severe dysplasia). Lesions showing moderate dysplasia or worse were more commonly found in patients with suspicious cells than in those with atypical cells on sputum examination. AFB was more sensitive than WLB (91 versus 58%) at detecting these lesions, but less specific (26 versus 50%). A combination of white-light and autofluorescence bronchoscopy can increase the diagnostic yield of this invasive procedure in patients exhibiting abnormal sputum cytology."

Recently, autofluorescence bronchoscopy has been reported to improve the early detection of lung cancer in high-risk individuals. In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of autofluorescence bronchoscopy for the early detection of bronchial premalignant and malignant lesions. From November 2000 through March 2004, 123 high-risk individuals (114 men and 9 women with a mean age of 68 years) were enrolled. Among 282 biopsy specimens, 93 (33.0%) were premalignant or malignant lesions. The sensitivity and negative predictive value for the detection of bronchial premalignant and malignant lesions were significantly higher with the addition of autofluorescence bronchoscopy than white light bronchoscopy alone. Moreover, the sensitivity for the detection of bronchial premalignant lesions was extremely higher with the addition of autofluorescence bronchoscopy than white light bronchoscopy alone, whereas there was no significant difference between autofluorescence bronchoscopy and white light bronchoscopy alone for the detection of non-malignant and malignant lesions. Autofluorescence bronchoscopy is a novel modality for the early detection of bronchial abnormality, especially for bronchial premalignant lesions."

The AFB utilizes inherent tissue properties to identify preinvasive lesions of the central airways. The EBUS can accurately define airway invasion versus compression from tumors, guide transbronchial needle aspiration of hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, and predict, based on ultrasound morphology, whether peripheral nodules are benign or malignant. It is also extremely useful for determining the proximal and distal extent of tumors in and around the airway, and aid in surgical planning. This article will review the principles and clinical applications of these two technologies."

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic yield of flexible video bronchoscopy (FVB) and autofluorescence bronchoscopy (i.e. lung imaging fluorescence endoscopy (LIFE)) in 151 patients at a high risk of lung cancer and with moderate dysplasia or worse on sputum cytology mass screening. Findings from FVB and LIFE were classified as either normal, abnormal or suspicious for cancer. Endobronchial biopsies (EBX) were obtained from abnormal or suspicious areas on FVB and/or LIFE, or randomly when FVB and LIFE were normal. Moderate dysplasia and worse were defined as pathologically positive. Overall, 83 out of 343 (24%) EBX were pathologically positive. The sensitivity of FVB was 72% and LIFE 96%. Relative sensitivity of LIFE over FVB was 1.33. Specificities of FVB and LIFE were 53 and 23%, respectively. The numbers of pathologically positive EBX from sites designated normal, abnormal or suspicious were: from FVB, 23 out of 162 (14%), 37 out of 151 (25%) and 23 out of 30 (77%); from LIFE, three out of 69 (4%), 44 out of 212 (21%) and 36 out of 62 (58%). In normal or abnormal areas at FVB, there was a significant increase in the yield of EBX guided by abnormal and suspicious sites noted at LIFE. In conclusion, endobronchial biopsies of suspicious findings from lung imaging fluorescence endoscopy and flexible video bronchoscopy have a good diagnostic yield. Lung imaging fluorescence endoscopy is more useful when flexible video bronchoscopy is either normal or abnormal."

Previous morphologic assessment has been limited to biopsy specimens, and therefore a high-magnification bronchovideoscope (side-viewing type) was developed for less invasive examination of subepithelial vessels. We evaluated vascularity in the lower trachea, using this novel scope in 12 normal control subjects, 13 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 24 subjects with stable asthma; 8 were steroid naive with newly diagnosed asthma (Group A) and 16 had been treated with inhaled corticosteroids for more than 5 years (Group B). The redness of bronchial mucosa in patients with asthma observed by conventional fiberoptic bronchoscopy proved to be due to a fine vascular network. Morphometric measurements of subepithelial vessels showed that both vessel area density and vessel length density were significantly (p&lt;0.0001) increased in subjects with asthma as compared with control subjects and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The degree of increase in vessels did not differ between Group A and Group B. The increase in subepithelial vessels of the airway is present even in newly diagnosed asthma. This novel bronchovideoscope is useful for assessment of vessel network in the surface of the airway lumen in vivo."

        "abstract": "Lung carcinogenesis is assumed to be a multistep process, but detailed understanding of the sequential morphological and molecular changes preceding invasive lung cancer remains elusive. To better understand early lung carcinogenesis, we initiated a program of fluorescence bronchoscopy in smokers at high risk for lung cancer. In the bronchial biopsies from these subjects, we observed a unique lesion consisting of capillary blood vessels closely juxtaposed to and projecting into metaplastic or dysplastic squamous bronchial epithelium, angiogenic squamous dysplasia (ASD). Serial sections of the capillary projections confirmed that they represent intramucosal capillary loops. Microvessel density in ASD was elevated in comparison to normal mucosa (P = 0.0003) but not in comparison to other forms of hyperplasia or dysplasia. ASD thus represents a qualitatively distinct form of angiogenesis in which there is architectural rearrangement of the capillary microvasculature. Genetic analysis of surface epithelium in a random subset of lesions revealed loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 3p in 53% of ASD lesions. No confirmed p53 mutations were identified. Compared with normal epithelium, proliferative activity was markedly elevated in ASD lesions. ASD occurred in 54 of 158 (34%) high-risk smokers without carcinoma and in 6 of 10 patients with squamous carcinoma who underwent fluorescence bronchoscopy. One early-stage invasive carcinoma was noteworthy for the occurrence of ASD juxtaposed to invasive tumor. Seventy-seven (59%) of the ASD lesions were detected by abnormal fluorescence alone. Twenty bronchial sites (11 patients) were rebiopsied 1 year after the initial diagnosis. At nine (45%) of these sites, the lesion was found to persist. The lesion was not present in biopsies from 16 normal nonsmoker control subjects. The presence of this lesion in high-risk smokers suggests that aberrant patterns of microvascularization may occur at an early stage of bronchial carcinogenesis."
