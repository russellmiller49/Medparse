Rigid bronchoscopy is preferred over /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopy for therapeutic procedures because the rigid bronchoscope has a larger diameter that allows for effective suctioning and the removal of large pieces of tissue, there is also the ability to ventilate through the scope, and the barrel of the scope is useful in coring out tissue and dilating stenoses. Most bronchoscopists use a combination of rigid and /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopic techniques in which the /uniFB02 exible scope is used through the rigid scope for better visualization of distal lesions or easier articulation in curved or tortuous airways."

Although heat therapy can be used to vaporize the tumor, it is used more commonly to coagulate the tumor before mechanical resection to control bleeding. The neodymium:yttriumaluminum-garnet laser was introduced in 1980s and has been the main heat modality used in the airways. 8 However, its use has decreased over the past decade in favor of other modalities. EC is a modality that uses an electric probe to conduct an electric current to heat the target tissue directly. EC is perceived as an alternative that is cheaper and easier to use than is laser and that also can be combined with accessories such as an EC knife and EC snare to provide effective ways to cut webs or snare polypoid lesions, respectively. 9-11 APC is an alternative noncontact electrocoagulation technique in which a high-frequency current meets with argon gas at the tip of probe to generate a plasma jet that heats tissue. APC is predominantly a coagulation technique because its depth of effect is limited to 1 to 3 mm. With all heat modalities, there is the concern for airway ignition when performed under high oxygen conditions. Thus, decreasing the FIO 2 to < 40% is recommended when heat ablative modalities are used. 9,12"

However, it gradually fell out of favor because it required repeated freeze and thaw cycles on the target lesion and had delayed effects, making it unsuitable for rapid relief of CAO. Instead, a new application of cryotherapy emerged. Cryoadhesion is a technique in which the cold temperature of the probe is used to adhere to the tissue, with the probe then being abruptly withdrawn, thereby retrieving the attached tissue. This technique can be used to remove luminal tumor tissue (cryocanalization), blood clots, mucous plugs, or foreign objects. 13,14"
