They may grow slowly, or might even stop growing or shrink. Typically benign lung lesions are usually not lifethreatening, and they do not generally need to be removed.

Screening the higher volume population with a reduced risk for a positive finding requires careful clinical decision-making by the physician, their patient and the tumor review board. Methods enabling a diagnosis of PPN less than 30 mm are appropriate for this patient population due to their low-risk profile. The cost-effectiveness of electromagnetic navigation (EMN) procedures has been compared with  CT-guided  TTNA  procedures.  EMN procedures  have  demonstrated  a  significant cost reduction to the hospital, especially with the addition of EMN-TTNA capabilities in the bronchoscopy suite [13] .  Tidal volume expiration (TV-EXP)-mapped EMN capturing breath motion during the procedure offers an opportunity to improve on accessing the PPN and to reduce the incidence of complications."

The pulmonologist uses the system to identify optimal  airway  segmentation,  target/nodule planning and finally use deformation algorithm maps to a tidal breathing expiration scan [21] . The TV-EXP process better accommodates to allow the pulmonologist to consistently reach targets less than 20 mm in size by compensating for respiratory movement.

The objective of this study was to determine the test performance characteristics of various modalities for the diagnosis of suspected lung cancer."

        "abstract": "Over the past 15 years, patients with a myriad of pulmonary conditions have been diagnosed and treated with new technologies developed for the pulmonary community. Advanced diagnostic and therapeutic procedures once performed in an operating theater under general anesthesia are now routinely performed in a bronchoscopy suite under moderate sedation with clinically meaningful improvements in outcome. With the miniaturization of scopes and instruments, improvements in optics, and creative engineers, a host of new devices has become available for clinical testing and use. A growing community of pulmonologists is doing comparative effectiveness trials that test new technologies against the current standard of care. While more research is needed, it seems reasonable to provide an overview of pulmonary procedures that are in various stages of development, testing, and practice at this time. Five areas are covered: navigational bronchoscopy, endobronchial ultrasound, endoscopic lung volume reduction, bronchial thermoplasty, and pleural procedure. Appropriate training for clinicians who wish to provide these services will become an area of intense scrutiny as new skills will need to be acquired to ensure patient safety and a good clinical result."

With recent data revealing mortality benefits with lung cancer screening via low-dose computed tomography, now more than ever, clinicians will be challenged with the task of providing the means to provide a safe and minimally invasive method of obtaining accurate tissue diagnostics for the pulmonary nodule. In this review, we present available technologies to aid clinicians in attempts at minimally invasive techniques and the data supporting their use. In addition, we review novel tools under investigation that may further increase yield and provide additional benefit in obtaining an early diagnosis of lung cancer."

While watchful  waiting  is  suitable  for  the  smallest lung lesions, Fleischner Society guidelines recommend biopsying lesions that are greater than 8 mm in this high-risk population. NLST found 39.1% patients had at least one positive screening result, compared with 16% positive results in the chest radiograph arm. A positive screening result was defined as at least one nodule ≥ 4 mm in diameter. Out of the positive LDCT screened patients, 1638 patients were recommended for a follow-up percutaneous computer tomography (CT)-guided transthoracic  needle  aspiration (TTNA) examination, bronchoscopy or a surgical procedure resulting in malignancy findings of 39.6% (649) [3] ."

A lung biopsy result indicating the suspect lung lesion is benign is by definition not malignant. A benign tumor is not expected to spread to other parts of the body. They may grow slowly, or might even stop growing or shrink. Typically benign lung lesions are usually not lifethreatening, and they do not generally need to be removed. A benign lung lesion could expand and push against nearby tissues but it will not invade, destroy or replace other tissues. Consideration for safe, effective patient management must be given to aid clinical decision-making for highrisk  patients  having  co-morbidities  and  pulmonary disease who are referred for follow-up resulting from a suspect lung lesion found on LDCT. Some of these patients may be poor surgical candidates; therefore a less invasive method is sought.",

TTNA represents  a  high  patient  morbidity profile [6-9] .  Flexible bronchoscopy is another diagnostic option due to the lower pneumothorax rate, however, the sensitivity of traditional bronchoscopic biopsy is only 34% for nodules less than 20 mm, and as low as 14% for the PPN [7,10] .  The  sensitivity  increases  to  63% when nodules are greater than 20 cm in size, but decreases as the distance from the hilum increases [10,11] .

While watchful  waiting  is  suitable  for  the  smallest lung lesions, Fleischner Society guidelines recommend biopsying lesions that are greater than 8 mm in this high-risk population. NLST found 39.1% patients had at least one positive screening result, compared with 16% positive results in the chest radiograph arm. A positive screening result was defined as at least one nodule ≥ 4 mm in diameter. Out of the positive LDCT screened patients, 1638 patients were recommended for a follow-up percutaneous computer tomography (CT)-guided transthoracic  needle  aspiration (TTNA) examination, bronchoscopy or a surgical procedure resulting in malignancy findings of 39.6% (649) [3] ."

A lung biopsy result indicating the suspect lung lesion is benign is by definition not malignant. A benign tumor is not expected to spread to other parts of the body. They may grow slowly, or might even stop growing or shrink. Typically benign lung lesions are usually not lifethreatening, and they do not generally need to be removed. A benign lung lesion could expand and push against nearby tissues but it will not invade, destroy or replace other tissues. Consideration for safe, effective patient management must be given to aid clinical decision-making for highrisk  patients  having  co-morbidities  and  pulmonary disease who are referred for follow-up resulting from a suspect lung lesion found on LDCT. Some of these patients may be poor surgical candidates; therefore a less invasive method is sought.",

TTNA represents  a  high  patient  morbidity profile [6-9] .  Flexible bronchoscopy is another diagnostic option due to the lower pneumothorax rate, however, the sensitivity of traditional bronchoscopic biopsy is only 34% for nodules less than 20 mm, and as low as 14% for the PPN [7,10] .  The  sensitivity  increases  to  63% when nodules are greater than 20 cm in size, but decreases as the distance from the hilum increases [10,11] .

While watchful  waiting  is  suitable  for  the  smallest lung lesions, Fleischner Society guidelines recommend biopsying lesions that are greater than 8 mm in this high-risk population. NLST found 39.1% patients had at least one positive screening result, compared with 16% positive results in the chest radiograph arm. A positive screening result was defined as at least one nodule ≥ 4 mm in diameter. Out of the positive LDCT screened patients, 1638 patients were recommended for a follow-up percutaneous computer tomography (CT)-guided transthoracic  needle  aspiration (TTNA) examination, bronchoscopy or a surgical procedure resulting in malignancy findings of 39.6% (649) [3] ."

          "o verify the diagnosis yet reduce the increased patient  morbidity  and  costs  of  a  population recommended for verification of suspect lung cancer. A lung biopsy result indicating the suspect lung lesion is benign is by definition not malignant. A benign tumor is not expected to spread to other parts of the body. They may grow slowly, or might even stop growing or shrink. Typically benign lung lesions are usually not lifethreatening, and they do not generally need to be removed. A benign lung lesion could expand and push against nearby tissues but it will not invade, destroy or replace other tissues. Consideration for safe, effective patient management must be given to aid clinical decision-making for highrisk  patients  having  co-morbidities  and  pulmonary disease who are referred for follow-up resulting from a suspect lung lesion found on LDCT. Some of these patients may be poor surgical candidates; therefore a less invasive method is sought.",
          "ung tissue biopsy is the selected option, then CT-guided TTNA is preferred. It has a high diagnostic yield slightly below 90%, yet a pneumothorax rate of about 30%, of which 15% of the patient's tend to require a chest tube. TTNA represents  a  high  patient  morbidity profile [6-9] .  Flexible bronchoscopy is another diagnostic option due to the lower pneumothorax rate, however, the sensitivity of traditional bronchoscopic biopsy is only 34% for nodules less than 20 mm, and as low as 14% for the PPN [7,10] .  The  sensitivity  increases  to  63% when nodules are greater than 20 cm in size, but decreases as the distance from the hilum increases [10,11] .

While watchful  waiting  is  suitable  for  the  smallest lung lesions, Fleischner Society guidelines recommend biopsying lesions that are greater than 8 mm in this high-risk population. NLST found 39.1% patients had at least one positive screening result, compared with 16% positive results in the chest radiograph arm. A positive screening result was defined as at least one nodule ≥ 4 mm in diameter. Out of the positive LDCT screened patients, 1638 patients were recommended for a follow-up percutaneous computer tomography (CT)-guided transthoracic  needle  aspiration (TTNA) examination, bronchoscopy or a surgical procedure resulting in malignancy findings of 39.6% (649) [3] ."

A lung biopsy result indicating the suspect lung lesion is benign is by definition not malignant. A benign tumor is not expected to spread to other parts of the body. They may grow slowly, or might even stop growing or shrink. Typically benign lung lesions are usually not lifethreatening, and they do not generally need to be removed. A benign lung lesion could expand and push against nearby tissues but it will not invade, destroy or replace other tissues. Consideration for safe, effective patient management must be given to aid clinical decision-making for highrisk  patients  having  co-morbidities  and  pulmonary disease who are referred for follow-up resulting from a suspect lung lesion found on LDCT. Some of these patients may be poor surgical candidates; therefore a less invasive method is sought.",

TTNA represents  a  high  patient  morbidity profile [6-9] .  Flexible bronchoscopy is another diagnostic option due to the lower pneumothorax rate, however, the sensitivity of traditional bronchoscopic biopsy is only 34% for nodules less than 20 mm, and as low as 14% for the PPN [7,10] .  The  sensitivity  increases  to  63% when nodules are greater than 20 cm in size, but decreases as the distance from the hilum increases [10,11] .

While watchful  waiting  is  suitable  for  the  smallest lung lesions, Fleischner Society guidelines recommend biopsying lesions that are greater than 8 mm in this high-risk population. NLST found 39.1% patients had at least one positive screening result, compared with 16% positive results in the chest radiograph arm. A positive screening result was defined as at least one nodule ≥ 4 mm in diameter. Out of the positive LDCT screened patients, 1638 patients were recommended for a follow-up percutaneous computer tomography (CT)-guided transthoracic  needle  aspiration (TTNA) examination, bronchoscopy or a surgical procedure resulting in malignancy findings of 39.6% (649) [3] ."

A lung biopsy result indicating the suspect lung lesion is benign is by definition not malignant. A benign tumor is not expected to spread to other parts of the body. They may grow slowly, or might even stop growing or shrink. Typically benign lung lesions are usually not lifethreatening, and they do not generally need to be removed. A benign lung lesion could expand and push against nearby tissues but it will not invade, destroy or replace other tissues. Consideration for safe, effective patient management must be given to aid clinical decision-making for highrisk  patients  having  co-morbidities  and  pulmonary disease who are referred for follow-up resulting from a suspect lung lesion found on LDCT. Some of these patients may be poor surgical candidates; therefore a less invasive method is sought.",

TTNA represents  a  high  patient  morbidity profile [6-9] .  Flexible bronchoscopy is another diagnostic option due to the lower pneumothorax rate, however, the sensitivity of traditional bronchoscopic biopsy is only 34% for nodules less than 20 mm, and as low as 14% for the PPN [7,10] .  The  sensitivity  increases  to  63% when nodules are greater than 20 cm in size, but decreases as the distance from the hilum increases [10,11] .
