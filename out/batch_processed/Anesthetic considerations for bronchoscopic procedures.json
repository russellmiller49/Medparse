With the  initiation  of  the  Lung  Transplantation  program at the CCF in 1990 the portfolio of work expanded to include the various complications that can occur after lung transplantation. Cleveland Clinic was the first institution to introduce successful management of airway dehiscence with temporary placement of uncovered self-expanding metallic stents (1)."

Adding to this effect is the bronchial smooth muscle relaxation, decreasing airway size, which occurs with inhalational anesthetic and neuromuscular blockade. There is also a reduction in thoracic volume as a result of cephalad displacement of the paralyzed diaphragm after neuromuscular blockade. The decrease in the size of the airways enhances the effect of extrinsic compression (18,19,21,22). Even without use of neuromuscular blockade, the loss of transpulmonary pressure gradient with positive pressure ventilation can lead to complete obstruction. Thus, difficulty ventilating or major airway obstruction in patients with mediastinal masses  can  occur  during  induction,  maintenance, positioning or emergence of anesthesia. Due to this potential of complete airway collapse with positive pressure ventilation, maintenance of spontaneous ventilation is of the utmost importance. Awake fiberoptic intubation with the maintenance of spontaneous ventilation should be strongly considered (18,19,21-24). Alternatively, an inhaled induction with volatile anesthesia maintaining spontaneous ventilation with subsequent intubation can be performed. Inhalational anesthesia, ketamine and dexmedetomidine are all good options as they do not ablate respiratory drive. General anesthesia with spontaneous ventilation may be maintained with an inhalational agent or with ketamine or dexmedetomidine infusion (9,25). Ketamine may be safer than inhalational anesthetic with spontaneous respirations as inhalational agents cause a decrease in bronchial wall tone whereas ketamine appears to maintain intercostal and chest wall tone better than inhalational agents (10)."

It consists of an uncuffed silicone T-tube that has its long limb in the trachea and its short limb projecting through the tracheostomy stoma.

Alternatively, the patient can be preoxygenated by attaching the anesthesia circuit to the T-tube. This can be done by attaching an appropriately sized ETT connector to  the  T-tube and attaching the anesthesia circuit to this  connector ( Figure 4 ).  Once  the  patient  is  asleep and spontaneous breathing stopped, positive pressure ventilation is initiated. If there is excessive leakage from the nose and mouth, this can be alleviated by pinching the nose and lips shut. Although positive pressure ventilation is  not 100% effective with this method as the T-tube is uncuffed, it is generally sufficient for a short period of time. Sometimes the placement of a SGA mouth with its connector end capped off, seals the proximal end of the T-tube and decreases leakage through the mouth. At all times anesthesiologists must be vigilant for the occurrence",

SEMS have a higher rate of trauma, including pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, infection, vascular and airway damage as well as bleeding. The SEMS do not block the normal bronchial wall mucociliary elevator mechanism, thus mucus plugging is less of a problem.

The decrease in the size of the airways enhances the effect of extrinsic compression (18,19,21,22). Even without use of neuromuscular blockade, the loss of transpulmonary pressure gradient with positive pressure ventilation can lead to complete obstruction. Thus, difficulty ventilating or major airway obstruction in patients with mediastinal masses  can  occur  during  induction,  maintenance, positioning or emergence of anesthesia. Due to this potential of complete airway collapse with positive pressure ventilation, maintenance of spontaneous ventilation is of the utmost importance. Awake fiberoptic intubation with the maintenance of spontaneous ventilation should be strongly considered (18,19,21-24). Alternatively, an inhaled induction with volatile anesthesia maintaining spontaneous ventilation with subsequent intubation can be performed. Inhalational anesthesia, ketamine and dexmedetomidine are all good options as they do not ablate respiratory drive. General anesthesia with spontaneous ventilation may be maintained with an inhalational agent or with ketamine or dexmedetomidine infusion (9,25).

Adding to this effect is the bronchial smooth muscle relaxation, decreasing airway size, which occurs with inhalational anesthetic and neuromuscular blockade. There is also a reduction in thoracic volume as a result of cephalad displacement of the paralyzed diaphragm after neuromuscular blockade. The decrease in the size of the airways enhances the effect of extrinsic compression (18,19,21,22). Even without use of neuromuscular blockade, the loss of transpulmonary pressure gradient with positive pressure ventilation can lead to complete obstruction. Thus, difficulty ventilating or major airway obstruction in patients with mediastinal masses  can  occur  during  induction,  maintenance, positioning or emergence of anesthesia. Due to this potential of complete airway collapse with positive pressure ventilation, maintenance of spontaneous ventilation is of the utmost importance. Awake fiberoptic intubation with the maintenance of spontaneous ventilation should be strongly considered (18,19,21-24). Alternatively, an inhaled induction with volatile anesthesia maintaining spontaneous ventilation with subsequent intubation can be performed. Inhalational anesthesia, ketamine and dexmedetomidine are all good options as they do not ablate respiratory drive. General anesthesia with spontaneous ventilation may be maintained with an inhalational agent or with ketamine or dexmedetomidine infusion (9,25). Ketamine may be safer than inhalational anesthetic with spontaneous respirations as inhalational agents cause a decrease in bronchial wall tone whereas ketamine appears to maintain intercostal and chest wall tone better than inhalational agents (10).",

Adding to this effect is the bronchial smooth muscle relaxation, decreasing airway size, which occurs with inhalational anesthetic and neuromuscular blockade. There is also a reduction in thoracic volume as a result of cephalad displacement of the paralyzed diaphragm after neuromuscular blockade. The decrease in the size of the airways enhances the effect of extrinsic compression (18,19,21,22). Even without use of neuromuscular blockade, the loss of transpulmonary pressure gradient with positive pressure ventilation can lead to complete obstruction. Thus, difficulty ventilating or major airway obstruction in patients with mediastinal masses  can  occur  during  induction,  maintenance, positioning or emergence of anesthesia. Due to this potential of complete airway collapse with positive pressure ventilation, maintenance of spontaneous ventilation is of the utmost importance. Awake fiberoptic intubation with the maintenance of spontaneous ventilation should be strongly considered (18,19,21-24). Alternatively, an inhaled induction with volatile anesthesia maintaining spontaneous ventilation with subsequent intubation can be performed. Inhalational anesthesia, ketamine and dexmedetomidine are all good options as they do not ablate respiratory drive. General anesthesia with spontaneous ventilation may be maintained with an inhalational agent or with ketamine or dexmedetomidine infusion (9,25). Ketamine may be safer than inhalational anesthetic with spontaneous respirations as inhalational agents cause a decrease in bronchial wall tone whereas ketamine appears to maintain intercostal and chest wall tone better than inhalational agents (10).",
