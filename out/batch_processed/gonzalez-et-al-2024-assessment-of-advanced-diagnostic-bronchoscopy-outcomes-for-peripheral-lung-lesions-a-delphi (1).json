A strict definition of diagnostic yield should be used, and studies should be reported according to the STARD (Standards for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy Studies) guidelines. Clinical or radiographic follow-up may be incorporated into the reference standard definition but should not be used to calculate diagnostic yield from the procedural encounter. Methodologically robust comparative studies, with incorporation of patient-reported outcomes, are needed to adequately assess and validate minimally invasive diagnostic technologies targeting the lung periphery."

            "text": "The introduction of innovations into clinical practice is often based on the promise and excitement of early adoption rather than solid proof. There is a trade-off between the bene /uniFB01 t of early access to promising devices and the risk of harm from incompletely validated devices. Most medical devices currently enter clinical practice through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ' s 510(k) pathway, a less stringent approval process with inherent limitations. Lack of highquality research with /uniFB01 rm outcome de /uniFB01 nitions constitutes a barrier to introduction of novel technology in both pluralistic and single-payer systems. This American Thoracic Society/American College of Chest Physicians statement aims to provide a research framework that allows greater standardization of device validation efforts through clearly de /uniFB01 ned diagnostic outcomes and robust study designs. Highquality studies, both industry and publicly funded, can support subsequent health economic analyses and guide implementation decisions in various healthcare settings. /H17039"

The method of diagnosis of lung cancer depends on the type of lung cancer (small cell lung cancer or non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC]), the size and location of the primary tumor, the presence of metastasis, and the overall clinical status of the patient. The objective of this study was to determine the test performance characteristics of various modalities for the diagnosis of suspected lung cancer."

        "abstract": "<b>Rationale:</b> Strict adherence to procedural protocols and diagnostic definitions is critical to understand the efficacy of new technologies. Electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy (ENB) for lung nodule biopsy has been used for decades without a solid understanding of its efficacy, but offers the opportunity for simultaneous tissue acquisition via electromagnetic navigational transthoracic biopsy (EMN-TTNA) and staging via endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS). <b>Objective:</b> To evaluate the diagnostic yield of EBUS, ENB, and EMN-TTNA during a single procedure using a strict <i>a priori</i> definition of diagnostic yield with central pathology adjudication. <b>Methods:</b> A prospective, single-arm trial was conducted at eight centers enrolling participants with pulmonary nodules (&lt;3&#x2009;cm; without computed tomography [CT]- and/or positron emission tomography-positive mediastinal lymph nodes) who underwent a staged procedure with same-day CT, EBUS, ENB, and EMN-TTNA. The procedure was staged such that, when a diagnosis had been achieved via rapid on-site pathologic evaluation, the procedure was ended and subsequent biopsy modalities were not attempted. A study finding was diagnostic if an independent pathology core laboratory confirmed malignancy or a definitive benign finding. The primary endpoint was the diagnostic yield of the combination of CT, EBUS, ENB, and EMN-TTNA. <b>Measurements and Main Results:</b> A total of 160 participants at 8 centers with a mean nodule size of 18&#x2009;&#xb1;&#x2009;6&#x2009;mm were enrolled. The diagnostic yield of the combined procedure was 59% (94 of 160; 95% confidence interval [CI], 51-66%). Nodule regression was found on same-day CT in 2.5% of cases (4 of 160; 95% CI, 0.69-6.3%), and EBUS confirmed malignancy in 7.1% of cases (11 of 156; 95% CI, 3.6-12%). The yield of ENB alone was 49% (74 of 150; 95% CI, 41-58%), that of EMN-TTNA alone was 27% (8 of 30; 95% CI, 12-46%), and that of ENB plus EMN-TTNA was 53% (79 of 150; 95% CI, 44-61%). Complications included a pneumothorax rate of 10% and a 2% bleeding rate. When EMN-TTNA was performed, the pneumothorax rate was 30%. <b>Conclusions:</b> The diagnostic yield for ENB is 49%, which increases to 59% with the addition of same-day CT, EBUS, and EMN-TTNA, lower than in prior reports in the literature. The high complication rate and low diagnostic yield of EMN-TTNA does not support its routine use. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03338049)."

These implants encode luminance of the visual scene into electrical stimulation, however, leaving out chromatic information. Yet color plays an important role in visual processing when it comes to recognizing objects and orienting to the environment, especially at low spatial resolution as generated by current retinal prostheses. In this study, we tested the feasibility of partially restoring color perception in blind RP patients, with the aim to provide chromatic information as an extra visual cue."

        "abstract": "Research publication can both communicate and miscommunicate. Unless research is adequately reported, the time and resources invested in the conduct of research is wasted. Reporting guidelines such as CONSORT, STARD, PRISMA, and ARRIVE aim to improve the quality of research reports, but all are much less adopted and adhered to than they should be. Adequate reports of research should clearly describe which questions were addressed and why, what was done, what was shown, and what the findings mean. However, substantial failures occur in each of these elements. For example, studies of published trial reports showed that the poor description of interventions meant that 40-89% were non-replicable; comparisons of protocols with publications showed that most studies had at least one primary outcome changed, introduced, or omitted; and investigators of new trials rarely set their findings in the context of a systematic review, and cited a very small and biased selection of previous relevant trials. Although best documented in reports of controlled trials, inadequate reporting occurs in all types of studies-animal and other preclinical studies, diagnostic studies, epidemiological studies, clinical prediction research, surveys, and qualitative studies. In this report, and in the Series more generally, we point to a waste at all stages in medical research. Although a more nuanced understanding of the complex systems involved in the conduct, writing, and publication of research is desirable, some immediate action can be taken to improve the reporting of research. Evidence for some recommendations is clear: change the current system of research rewards and regulations to encourage better and more complete reporting, and fund the development and maintenance of infrastructure to support better reporting, linkage, and archiving of all elements of research. However, the high amount of waste also warrants future investment in the monitoring of and research into reporting of research, and active implementation of the findings to ensure that research reports better address the needs of the range of research users."

        "abstract": "Overwhelming evidence shows the quality of reporting of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is not optimal. Without transparent reporting, readers cannot judge the reliability and validity of trial findings nor extract information for systematic reviews. Recent methodological analyses indicate that inadequate reporting and design are associated with biased estimates of treatment effects. Such systematic error is seriously damaging to RCTs, which are considered the gold standard for evaluating interventions because of their ability to minimise or avoid bias. A group of scientists and editors developed the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement to improve the quality of reporting of RCTs. It was first published in 1996 and updated in 2001. The statement consists of a checklist and flow diagram that authors can use for reporting an RCT. Many leading medical journals and major international editorial groups have endorsed the CONSORT statement. The statement facilitates critical appraisal and interpretation of RCTs. During the 2001 CONSORT revision, it became clear that explanation and elaboration of the principles underlying the CONSORT statement would help investigators and others to write or appraise trial reports. A CONSORT explanation and elaboration article was published in 2001 alongside the 2001 version of the CONSORT statement. After an expert meeting in January 2007, the CONSORT statement has been further revised and is published as the CONSORT 2010 Statement. This update improves the wording and clarity of the previous checklist and incorporates recommendations related to topics that have only recently received recognition, such as selective outcome reporting bias. This explanatory and elaboration document-intended to enhance the use, understanding, and dissemination of the CONSORT statement-has also been extensively revised. It presents the meaning and rationale for each new and updated checklist item providing examples of good reporting and, where possible, references to relevant empirical studies. Several examples of flow diagrams are included. The CONSORT 2010 Statement, this revised explanatory and elaboration document, and the associated website (www.consort-statement.org) should be helpful resources to improve reporting of randomised trials."

To meta-analyze the incidence and malignancy rate of non-diagnostic results, 3-by-2 table approaches rather than the conventional 2-by-2 approaches are needed to know its impact on the diagnostic performance of PTNB. A systematic literature search identified studies evaluating the diagnostic performance of PTNB with extractable outcomes. A total of 143 studies with 35,059 biopsies were included. The pooled incidence of non-diagnostic results was 6.8% (95% CI, 6.0-7.6%; I<sup>2</sup>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.91). The pooled malignancy rate of non-diagnostic results was 59.3% (95% CI, 51.7-66.8%; I<sup>2</sup>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.80), and was correlated with the prevalence of malignancy (correlation coefficient, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.42-0.91). Pooled percentage decrease of sensitivity and specificity due to non-diagnostic results were 4.5% (95% CI, 3.2-5.7%; I<sup>2</sup>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.64) and 10.7% (95% CI, 7.7-13.7%; I<sup>2</sup>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.70), respectively, and the pooled incidence of non-diagnostic results was 4.4% (95% CI, 3.2-5.8%; I<sup>2</sup>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.83) in lesions ultimately diagnosed as malignancies and 10.4% (95% CI, 7.5-13.8%; I<sup>2</sup>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.74) in benign disease. In conclusion, non-diagnostic results averagely occurred in 6.8% of PTNB and more than half of the results were malignancies. The non-diagnostic results decreased specificity and sensitivity by 10.7% and 4.5%, respectively, demanding efforts to minimize the non-diagnostic results in PTNB."

Its assessment is complex because of idiosyncrasies related to surgical practice, but necessary so that introduction and adoption of surgical innovations can derive from evidence-based principles rather than trial and error. A regulatory framework is also desirable to protect patients against the potential harms of any novel procedure. In this first of three Series papers on surgical innovation and evaluation, we propose a five-stage paradigm to describe the development of innovative surgical procedures."

At the exploration stage, the surgical intervention is usually more widely used, and observational studies should collect prospective data from multiple surgeons, deal with factors such as case mix and learning, and prepare for a definitive evaluation at the next stage of assessment. Although a randomised controlled trial is preferable, a high quality observational study would be acceptable if a randomised trial is not feasible or, on rare occasions, deemed unnecessary."

We compiled a list of historical examples of such effects and identified the features of convincing inferences about treatment effects from sources other than randomised trials. A unifying principle is the size of the treatment effect (signal) relative to the expected prognosis (noise) of the condition. A treatment effect is inferred most confidently when the signal to noise ratio is large and its timing is rapid compared with the natural course of the condition. For the examples we considered in detail the rate ratio often exceeds 10 and thus is highly unlikely to reflect bias or factors other than a treatment effect. This model may help to reduce controversy about evidence for treatments whose effects are so dramatic that randomised trials are unnecessary."

        "abstract": "The assessment of treatment effects from observational studies may be biased with patients not randomly allocated to the experimental or control group. One way to overcome this conceptual shortcoming in the design of such studies is the use of propensity scores to adjust for differences of the characteristics between patients treated with experimental and control interventions. The propensity score is defined as the probability that a patient received the experimental intervention conditional on pre-treatment characteristics at baseline. Here, we review how propensity scores are estimated and how they can help in adjusting the treatment effect for baseline imbalances. We further discuss how to evaluate adequate overlap of baseline characteristics between patient groups, provide guidelines for variable selection and model building in modelling the propensity score, and review different methods of propensity score adjustments. We conclude that propensity analyses may help in evaluating the comparability of patients in observational studies, and may account for more potential confounding factors than conventional covariate adjustment approaches. However, bias due to unmeasured confounding cannot be corrected for."

Physicians and patients completed surveys between February 1997 and June 1998. Data from 481 patients were analyzed. Over 80% of the patients rated physicians as very good or excellent, but they were least satisfied with the information that they were provided about FB, waiting time before and after FB, and the FB environment. Seventy-one percent of the patients would definitely return, and 22% would probably return for a repeat FB. Better health status (odds ratio [OR] 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-1.7), not being bothered by scope insertion (OR 2.0; 95% CI, 1.2-3.3), better rating of information quality (OR 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0-1.3), and better rating of physician quality (OR 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0-1.2) were associated with patients reporting that they would definitely return for a repeat FB. Although patient satisfaction with providers is high, there are specific patient and process of care factors that should be improved. Sicker patients may be at a risk of dissatisfaction with FB. Process of care measures that could improve satisfaction with FB include providing better information to patients and optimizing the experience of bronchoscope insertion."

In contrast, the NAVIGATE (Clinical Evaluation of superDimension Navigation System for Electromagnetic Navigation Bronchoscopy) study (10) reported a 12-month diagnostic yield, incorporating the results of a 12-month CT follow-up into the interpretation of biopsy results. This is akin to ' revisionist history ' in the presence of nonspeci /uniFB01 c in /uniFB02 ammatory or nondiagnostic /uniFB01 ndings at the index bronchoscopy (23, 30).

Table 1 summarizes the proposed de /uniFB01 nitions for diagnostic outcome measures. We recommend against using so-called intermediate or liberal de /uniFB01 nitions of diagnostic yield, because a level of uncertainty remains in patients without a speci /uniFB01 c diagnosis at the time the procedure is performed (i.e., some patients with a ' nonspeci /uniFB01 c diagnosis: benign ' or",

Tools to access the periphery include thin and ultrathin conventional bronchoscopes, radial endobronchial ultrasound, virtual bronchoscopy, transparenchymal nodule access, electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy, and robotic-assisted bronchoscopy.

In contrast, the NAVIGATE (Clinical Evaluation of superDimension Navigation System for Electromagnetic Navigation Bronchoscopy) study (10) reported a 12-month diagnostic yield, incorporating the results of a 12-month CT follow-up into the interpretation of biopsy results. This is akin to ' revisionist history ' in the presence of nonspeci /uniFB01 c in /uniFB02 ammatory or nondiagnostic /uniFB01 ndings at the index bronchoscopy (23, 30). Importantly, this ' 12-month ' diagnostic yield erroneously incorporates an element of the reference standard (CT follow-up) into the de /uniFB01 nition of the index test result, a problem also associated with the so-called intermediate and liberal de /uniFB01 nitions of diagnostic yield. Table 1 summarizes the proposed de /uniFB01 nitions for diagnostic outcome measures. We recommend against using so-called intermediate or liberal de /uniFB01 nitions of diagnostic yield, because a level of uncertainty remains in patients without a speci /uniFB01 c diagnosis at the time the procedure is performed (i.e., some patients with a ' nonspeci /uniFB01 c diagnosis: benign ' or",

In contrast, the NAVIGATE (Clinical Evaluation of superDimension Navigation System for Electromagnetic Navigation Bronchoscopy) study (10) reported a 12-month diagnostic yield, incorporating the results of a 12-month CT follow-up into the interpretation of biopsy results. This is akin to ' revisionist history ' in the presence of nonspeci /uniFB01 c in /uniFB02 ammatory or nondiagnostic /uniFB01 ndings at the index bronchoscopy (23, 30).

Table 1 summarizes the proposed de /uniFB01 nitions for diagnostic outcome measures. We recommend against using so-called intermediate or liberal de /uniFB01 nitions of diagnostic yield, because a level of uncertainty remains in patients without a speci /uniFB01 c diagnosis at the time the procedure is performed (i.e., some patients with a ' nonspeci /uniFB01 c diagnosis: benign ' or",

In contrast, the NAVIGATE (Clinical Evaluation of superDimension Navigation System for Electromagnetic Navigation Bronchoscopy) study (10) reported a 12-month diagnostic yield, incorporating the results of a 12-month CT follow-up into the interpretation of biopsy results. This is akin to ' revisionist history ' in the presence of nonspeci /uniFB01 c in /uniFB02 ammatory or nondiagnostic /uniFB01 ndings at the index bronchoscopy (23, 30).

Table 1 summarizes the proposed de /uniFB01 nitions for diagnostic outcome measures. We recommend against using so-called intermediate or liberal de /uniFB01 nitions of diagnostic yield, because a level of uncertainty remains in patients without a speci /uniFB01 c diagnosis at the time the procedure is performed (i.e., some patients with a ' nonspeci /uniFB01 c diagnosis: benign ' or",

Tools to access the periphery include thin and ultrathin conventional bronchoscopes, radial endobronchial ultrasound, virtual bronchoscopy, transparenchymal nodule access, electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy, and robotic-assisted bronchoscopy.

In contrast, the NAVIGATE (Clinical Evaluation of superDimension Navigation System for Electromagnetic Navigation Bronchoscopy) study (10) reported a 12-month diagnostic yield, incorporating the results of a 12-month CT follow-up into the interpretation of biopsy results. This is akin to ' revisionist history ' in the presence of nonspeci /uniFB01 c in /uniFB02 ammatory or nondiagnostic /uniFB01 ndings at the index bronchoscopy (23, 30).

Table 1 summarizes the proposed de /uniFB01 nitions for diagnostic outcome measures. We recommend against using so-called intermediate or liberal de /uniFB01 nitions of diagnostic yield, because a level of uncertainty remains in patients without a speci /uniFB01 c diagnosis at the time the procedure is performed (i.e., some patients with a ' nonspeci /uniFB01 c diagnosis: benign ' or",
