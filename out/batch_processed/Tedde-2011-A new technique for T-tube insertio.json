Montgomery described the way in which it is usually inserted, but this conventional insertion technique can fail in cases of subglottic stenosis due to the softness of the T tube, which kinks when forced against resistance.

All rights reserved. Some modifications of the technique have been described in the literature when conventional placement fails [1]. These modifications use laborious manoeuvres and require the use of rigid bronchoscopy or suspension laryngoscopy. Cooper [2] has used the umbilical tape to place the proximal end of the intraluminal limb in the stenotic subglottic space. This tape is passed through the external limb and proximal end of the T tube, goes through the tracheostoma, and is pulled out by the mouth with a rigid bronchoscope. Shapshay [3] straightened a folded proximal end of the intraluminal limb by pulling with a forceps using a rigid bronchoscope. Kato [4] used a cone-shaped dilator placed beforehand at the proximal end of the intraluminal limb of the T tube. Once the set is inserted into the tracheostoma, it is possible to pull it out by the mouth making the proximal end of the T tube www.elsevier.com/locate/ejcts European Journal of Cardio-thoracic Surgery 39 (2011) 130-131 fax: +55 11 3151 6500.

Bibas intubated the patient with a cuffed endotracheal tube elongated by an uncuffed tube until this set can be pulled out by the tracheostoma. He inserted the tip of this long tube into the proximal end of the T tube and inflated the cuff so that both tubes become connected and he could pull them together, allowing the proximal end to be inserted inside stenotic subglottic area [5]. There are three advantages with our technique: a T tube can be inserted without the aid of suspension laryngoscopy or rigid bronchoscopy; insufflating the cuff of the Foley catheter helps to adjust the prosthesis in the subglottic stenotic area; and, under direct bronchoscopy, we can view the cuff insufflation which can be repeated as many times as required. Moreover, Foley catheters are ubiquitous, have the required cuff, are not expensive and with their use this technique has good results",

The airway is dilatated with suspension laryngoscopy or rigid bronchoscopy and Montgomery insertion is initiated. When we found difficulties in placing the proximal end, we used the technique as depicted in Fig. 1. Using an intubation laryngoscope and a Magill grasper, a 10-F nasogastric tube (NT) is folded and inserted through the mouth and exteriorised by the tracheostoma. It is then introduced through the proximal end of the Montgomery and exteriorised in the extraluminal limb. The folded NT is introduced through the distal perforation of the Foley catheter, creating a large loop which can be passed around the T tube. The NT is then tractioned back in such a way that it becomes firmly attached to the Foley catheter. A forceps grasps the distal end of the Montgomery T tube inserting it into the trachea in the classical manner. Stretching the set NT/Foley catheter helps to introduce the proximal end inside the trachea. The bronchoscopic direct vision allows the Foley catheter to be insufflated, as many times as necessary, until the T-tube",

Our use of the tube was as follows: prior to definitive resection, as a better alternative to tracheostomy tube, while we were awaiting the most appropriate time for resection; at the time of resection, as an adjunct to segmental subglottic resection, used to stent residual abnormal laryngeal mucosa: following tracheal resection for uncertain or unsatisfactory healing: as sole treatment, when resection was deemed unsuitable or inappropriate. When stenting the high region, the upper limb of the T-tube can be brought through the vocal cords with preservation of a functional voice and without injury to the vocal cords even with prolonged use. In contrast to a tracheostomy tube, the T-tube provides respiration through the the nasopharynx, so that humidification and phonation are maintained. It is generally trouble free, requires little if any maintenance, and can remain in place for a year or more when necessary."

All patients had previous traumatic or prolonged endotracheal intubation requiring a tracheotomy and presented with aphonia as the major complaint. Multiple laser and dilation treatments were necessary in ten patients. Average duration of T-tube placement was 6 months. Excellent results (decannulation and good voice) were achieved in eight patients with a follow-up of 9 months to 6 years. Persistent granulation tissue and some degree of fibrosis were the most common complications (eight of 12 patients). Two patients died of medical complications. A high success rate with this endoscopic technique justifies this approach as our initial therapy, with open surgical techniques reserved for failure."

          "Using an intubation laryngoscope and a Magill grasper, a 10-F nasogastric tube (NT) is folded and inserted through the mouth and exteriorised by the tracheostoma. It is then introduced through the proximal end of the Montgomery and exteriorised in the extraluminal limb. The folded NT is introduced through the distal perforation of the Foley catheter, creating a large loop which can be passed around the T tube. The NT is then tractioned back in such a way that it becomes firmly attached to the Foley catheter. A forceps grasps the distal end of the Montgomery T tube inserting it into the trachea in the classical manner. Stretching the set NT/Foley catheter helps to introduce the proximal end inside the trachea.
