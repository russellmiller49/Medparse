The incidence of lethal and nonlethal airway complications has decreased since the early experiences with double- and single-lung transplantation. The most common risk factor associated with post-lung transplantation airway complications is anastomotic ischemia. Airway complications include the development of exophytic granulation tissue, bronchial stenosis, bronchomalacia, airway /uniFB01 stula, endobronchial infection, and anastomotic dehiscence. The broadening array of bronchoscopic therapies has enhanced treatment options for lung transplant recipients with airway complications. This article reviews the risk factors, clinical manifestations, and treatments of airway complications following lung transplantation and provides our expert opinion when evidence is lacking."

Obstructive granulation tissue resulting in airway compromise is best treated with cold therapies, including cryodebridement or cryotherapy. Cryodebridement can be performed using the cryotherapy probe to freeze granulation tissue, followed by withdrawal of the probe with the tissue attached. 30 Cryotherapy, in contrast, involves repeated cycles of freezing and thawing of obstructing tissue. This process crystallizes tissue, causing microthrombi formation along with intracellular and extracellular ice crystal formation resulting in cell death. 31,32 In the weeks following cryotherapy, necrosing granulation tissue sloughs off the airway without damage to the bronchial wall. Cryodebridement and cryotherapy are effective in recanalizing the airway without inciting further in /uniFB02 ammation. Hot therapies, such as Nd:YAG laser, argon plasma coagulation, or electrocautery, are also effective in restoring patency to airways, but they harbor the potential for generating further in /uniFB02 ammation and provoking more granulation tissue formation.

Because balloon bronchoplasty stretches the airway circumferentially, the airway often returns to the original narrowed state over time. Instead, we recommend combining balloon bronchoplasty with radial incisions and steroid injections at the site of stenosis. Radial incisions allow tearing along the radial scores during dilation rather than mere circumferential stretching of the airway. Incisions are traditionally made at the 12 o ' clock, 8 o ' clock, and 4 o ' clock positions with an electrocautery knife or Nd:YAG laser.

The known adverse effect of excessive granulation tissue formation associated with self-expanding metallic stents is used to provide a platform for dehiscence healing and remodeling of the airway. We prefer uncovered self-expanding metallic stents to avoid bacterial colonization of the stent coating and to allow drainage of mediastinal and bronchial secretions while still allowing ventilation of involved lobes. Typically, self-expanding metallic stents are removed after 4 to 6 weeks to avoid excess growth of granulation tissue, which would making stent removal challenging. Extreme caution is required for the deployment and removal of self-expanding metallic stents due to the risk of creating a larger defect with stent manipulation."

Although the incidence of airway complications is signi /uniFB01 cantly lower than other more common transplantation-related maladies such as chronic lung allograft dysfunction, they often represent a management conundrum for clinicians when they do supervene. Patients may be beset by recurrent hospitalizations and repeated procedures, which may profoundly affect the quality of life. Despite signi /uniFB01 cant progress in surgical technique, immunosuppressive strategies, and postoperative intensive care, the optimal management of airway complications post-lung transplantation has yet to be clearly de /uniFB01 ned.

        "abstract": "We evaluated various clinical factors to identify predictors of airway complication after lung transplantation. Two hundred twenty-nine consecutive single (n = 110) and bilateral (n = 119) lung transplants were done between September 1988 and August 1994. These 348 bronchial anastomoses were retrospectively analyzed. Airway complication that necessitated clinical intervention affected 33 anastomoses (9.5%) in 29 patients (12.8%). Satisfactory healing was achieved in 22 of these patients by conservative therapy such as one or a combination of dilation, stent, and laser. There were five deaths (2.2%) attributable to airway complications. One patient had an early postoperative death unrelated to airway complication and one patient has a recalcitrant bronchus intermedius stricture. Complication occurred more often in single-lung than in bilateral lung transplants (16/110, 14.4%, versus 17/238, 7.1%; p &lt; 0.05). The use of a mattress suture (21/153, 13.7%) was associated with more frequent complications than was simple interrupted suture (8/122, 6.6%) or figure-of-eight suture (4/73, 5.5%) (p &lt; 0.05). For patients in whom airway complications subsequently developed, the duration of postoperative mechanical ventilation was greater than that for those in whom an airway complication did not develop. The prevalence of airway complications as our program evolved was evaluated by separating the 229 transplants into three groups: phase I, the first 77 transplants; phase II, the next 76 transplants; and phase III, the most recent 76 transplants. The airway complication rate per anastomosis was significantly lower in phase III (5/126, 4.0%) than in phase I (12/110, 10.9%; p &lt; 0.05) and phase II (16/112, 14.3%; p &lt; 0.01). The majority of airway complications are successfully treated and rarely fatal. The recent reduction in prevalence of airway complications is likely a result of better maintenance immunosuppression and rejection surveillance."

        "abstract": "This article reviews the literature on airway healing after lung transplantation. From a historical point of view, this has been the Achilles' heel of lung transplantation through two decades, from the first attempt at single-lung transplantation in 1963 to the clinical successes in the early 1980s. The overall incidence of lethal airway complications is estimated to be 2% to 3%, whereas that of late stricture is 7% to 14%. Comparison of experiences has been difficult without a universal classification; a new classification for airway and anastomotic complications and healing is proposed. Ischemia appears to be the most important factor influencing airway healing. Low-pressure collateral bronchial blood flow from the pulmonary artery may be affected by low cardiac output, reperfusion edema, or rejection; mucosal injury may be further increased by prolonged positive-pressure ventilation. Good bronchial healing appears to be possible without a protective wrap and with early use of steroids. The management of bronchial complications is challenging and requires endoscopic skills including knowledge of endobronchial laser photocoagulation and stent insertion techniques."

Up to now, however, its healing effect on bronchiectasis has never been demonstrated. We report a heart-lung transplant patient who developed chronic rejection (BOS stage 3) with the appearance of gross bronchiectasis on a spiral computed tomography (CT) chest scan. Within 2 weeks after starting azithromycin, the patient's forced expiratory volume in 1 second increased significantly and a repeat spiral CT chest scan 5 months later, showed a major improvement of the bronchiectasis. This case report illustrates that bronchiectasis may greatly improve after treatment with azithromycin and no longer needs to be considered an endstage finding in patients with severe BOS."

Data for pediatric transplantation have been scarce. We reviewed our experience in pediatric HLT and LT to determine the frequency of airway complications and to document the therapeutic modalities used for their treatment. Fifty-three patients (median age: 13.8 yr; range: 1.3 to 28.2 yr) underwent HLT (n = 25), SLT (n = 3), DLT (n = 25), or repeat DLT (n = 3) and survived for more than 72 h. Major anastomotic airway complications requiring intervention affected one of the 25 HLT (4%) and seven of the 28 LT (SLT + DLT) patients (25%) (p = 0.05). Four patients with granulation tissue occluding the airway were treated with forceps resection, laser ablation, or balloon dilatation. Three patients with fibrotic strictures received silicone stents, laser ablation, or balloon dilatation. Two patients with bronchomalacia or diffuse stricture below the anastomosis underwent metal stent placement. Five of seven patients who were treated for anastomotic complications had satisfactory relief of airway obstruction. As compared with previously studied adults, pediatric heart-lung transplant recipients had the same or a lower frequency, and pediatric lung transplant recipients had a higher frequency of major anastomotic airway complications. A variety of treatment modalities were necessary to achieve adequate relief of airway obstruction."

This study describes the use of a flexible cryoprobe for cryotherapy using nitrous oxide as a cryogen through a fiberoptic bronchoscope. The study group consisted of 22 patients, ages ranging from 28 to 82 years. Twenty patients had malignant TBO and two had bronchial obstruction (BO) following lung transplantation. Benign BO was first dilated with a balloon and followed with cryotherapy. Eighteen of the 20 malignant endobronchial lesions were completely removed. In three of these patients, the airway remained occluded due to extrinsic compression. Cryotherapy offers an alternative to Nd:YAG laser in the management of TBO. Cryotherapy offers other advantages such as being inexpensive, safe for the operator, and safe for other members of the team. Similarly for the patient, there is no danger of bronchial wall perforation or endobronchial fires, cryotherapy can be done under local anesthesia with conscious sedation, and it can be performed in an endoscopy suite."

Postoperatively, the patient presented with bilateral bronchial necrosis. During the 14th week, his FEV(1) dropped to 2.5 L from a baseline level of 3.4 L. A subtotal occlusion of the right mainstem bronchus below the suture was noted. Using argon electrocoagulation, the right upper lobe bronchus, the intermediate bronchus, and the right middle lobe bronchus were reopened. During the period between weeks 20 and 42 post-transplantation, a recurrent stenosis required eight endoscopic interventions combining dilatation and stenting. During the 42nd week, dilatation followed by mitomycin C application stabilized the right lung function. This case report is the first to describe the effectiveness of the local application of mitomycin C to stop recurring extensive bronchial stenosis following bronchial necrosis secondary to lung transplantation."

        "abstract": "Airway complications remain a source of significant morbidity after lung transplantation. The current incidence of such complications is 12% to 15%. The associated mortality is 2% to 3%. Extensive necrosis and anastomotic dehiscence have become rare, but granulation tissue accumulation, stenosis, and bronchomalacia persist. The major factors that increase the risk for such complications are those that aggravate anastomotic ischemia. Because blood flow to the donor main-stem bronchus is derived from collateral circulation from the pulmonary arteries, minimizing pulmonary inflammation, optimizing pulmonary blood flow, and limiting exposure to positive pressure ventilation are important considerations. Attention to organ preservation techniques and perioperative management is critically important. Controversy remains regarding the optimal anastomotic technique, but properly done, end-to-end anastomosis is readily reproducible and is associated with a low incidence of complications. Attempts to restore the bronchial circulation surgically are not associated with significant reductions in airway complications. Similarly, the routine use of vascularized soft tissue reinforcement no longer seems justified. Most complications can be managed readily with a combination of endoscopic techniques, including d&#xe9;bridement (with or without laser or cryotherapy), dilation, and stent placement. Resective procedures rarely are indicated, and retransplantation should be reserved for exceptional cases."

A low-dose technique should be considered for the dynamic portion to reduce radiation exposure. Visual and quantitative analysis of the central airways provide a comprehensive assessment by allowing for the accurate diagnosis of TBM, determining its extent, assessing for predisposing conditions, and aiding selection of candidates for stent placement or tracheoplasty procedures. This technique can also be helpful for assessing response of airway dynamics following therapeutic intervention."

We have performed 19 heart-lung transplants, with 1-month, 1-year, and 2-year actuarial survival rates of 95% +/- 5%, 84% +/- 8%, and 69% +/- 16%, respectively. Three early recipients died of bronchiolitis, and four patients who were operated on more than 2 years ago are currently being followed up with bronchiolitis. Since August 1988, 13 surviving recipients have undergone serial postoperative bronchoscopies and transbronchial biopsies with topical analgesia. Diffuse bronchomalacia, involving the main bronchi down to the fifth-order bronchi bilaterally, has developed in four patients with bronchiolitis 9 +/- 2 months after the diagnosis of bronchiolitis was confirmed. Pulmonary function tests have revealed a lower ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity, lower specific airway conductance, and higher airway resistance in heart-lung recipients with bronchomalacia than in patients with bronchiolitis alone. We conclude that diffuse bronchomalacia occurs frequently in heart-lung transplant recipients who have obliterative bronchiolitis. Bronchomalacia worsens the functional airflow obstruction caused by bronchiolitis and may play an important role clinically in the declining respiratory status of heart-lung transplant recipients."

In the diagnosis of this disease, continuous dynamic CT scanning (1 slice/0.6 second) from inspiration to deep expiration was better than X-ray cine recording. It is difficult to observe the most collapsed airway on coughing using bronchofiberscopic recording, because its duration time was estimated to be 1/10 second by X-ray cine recording, whereas the findings at one instant were easily recorded by video-bronchoscopy on coughing. The degree of severity of this disease was classified into three groups. 1st degree 0-50% narrowing of airway caliber, 2nd degree 50-75%; and 3rd degree 75-100%. Severity of 2nd or 3rd degree was present in 542 (12.7%) of 4283 patients suffering from chest disease who underwent bronchoscopy. Seventy-two percent of patients were aged 50 to 80 years. Third degree tracheomalacia was found in 131 patients with an incidence of 3.1%, which increased from 2.2% at 50 years to 6.2% at 80 years. The autopsy findings of the trachea consisted of fragmentation of the tracheal cartilage and extension of the membranous portion. The pathogenesis may be varied with different types of collapse of the airway, including the saber sheath type and the crescent type. Surgical treatment consists of prevention of the airway collapse by wrapping the airway with Marlex mesh and bonding Lyodura (lyophilized dura mata) with fibrin glue, which is more reliable than the span plasty proposed by Nissen."

Persistent air leakage during cough was noted and bronchoscopy 12 days after transplantation demonstrated post-lobectomy bronchial stump dehiscence with a large bronchopleural fistula. We applied twice tissue glue instillation on the dehiscent bronchial stump through flexible bronchoscopy. The air leak improved and the patient was discharged 3 months after transplantation uneventfully. Two months after discharge, bronchoscopy showed complete healing of the dehiscent bronchial stump. Now, she lives independently without oxygen support."

        "abstract": "A bronchopleural fistula (BPF) is a communication between the pleural space and the bronchial tree. Although rare, BPFs represent a challenging management problem and are associated with high morbidity and mortality. By far, the postoperative complication of pulmonary resection is the most common cause, followed by lung necrosis complicating infection, persistent spontaneous pneumothorax, chemotherapy or radiotherapy (for lung cancer), and tuberculosis. The treatment of BPF includes various surgical and medical procedures, and of particular interest is the use of bronchoscopy and different glues, coils, and sealants. Localization of the fistula and size may indicate potential benefits of surgical vs endoscopic procedures. In high-risk surgical patients, endoscopic procedures may serve as a temporary bridge until the patient's clinical status is improved, while in other patients endoscopic procedures may be the only option. Therapeutic success has been variable, and the lack of consensus suggests that no optimal therapy is available; rather, the current therapeutic options seem to be complementary, and the treatment should be individualized."

Current barriers to long-term survival are chronic lung allograft dysfunction and infection. Bronchial artery revascularization was effective in decreasing bronchial anastomotic complications, but it was largely abandoned because of technical challenges."

Initial goals of bronchial artery revascularization include reducing the incidence of airway ischemia and improving bronchial healing. Benefits of restored bronchial artery circulation may extend beyond bronchial healing alone."

We describe our experience using self-expanding metallic stents to treat post-lung transplant bronchial dehiscence. From January 1995 to June 2004, 189 single and 118 double lung transplants were performed in our institution, totaling 425 at-risk bronchial anastomoses. Seven (1.6%) incidents of life-threatening bronchial dehiscence were treated with self-expanding metallic stents. The interval between transplant and diagnosis of dehiscence was 29.1 +/- 18.5 days. All patients presented with respiratory distress, and three required mechanical ventilation. Self-expanding metallic stent placement resulted in complete bronchial healing. All three patients with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation were successfully weaned after stent placement. In two later cases, the stents were electively removed after adequate healing of the dehiscence. Complications included stent migration (one patient) and in-stent stenosis (three patients). Two of these patients required repeat stent insertion after removal, due to bronchomalacia. In patients with life-threatening bronchial dehiscence, self-expanding metallic stents offer prospects for a successful outcome. Self-expanding metallic stents are known to be associated with significant granulation tissue formation, and this property provides a platform for healing of dehiscence and, in time, peribronchial soft tissue grows in to cover the defect, allowing stent removal."

Acute rejection (at least Grade A1 ISHLT) was detected in 1 patient. Incidence of infection was 0.6 infection per 100 patient-days (3 Aspergillus infections). Until hospital discharge mean sirolimus trough level was 6.2 +/- 1.2 ng/ml. Depending upon mean sirolimus trough levels of each patient, severe wound-healing complications were seen in 3 patients, resulting in bronchial airway dehiscence in 2 patients with lethal outcome in 1 patient. As a result of these complications, we revised the study design after inclusion of only 4 patients: Sirolimus administration is now started after completion of bronchial wound-healing. Sirolimus-based immunosuppressive therapy administered immediately after lung transplantation seems to be associated with severe wound-healing complications of the bronchial anastomosis."

We present the case of a 59-year-old man with bilateral lung transplantation for interstitial pulmonary fibrosis who was readmitted with symptoms of acute rejection and severe hypoxemic respiratory failure on day 14. Bronchoscopy showed bilateral bronchial anastomotic dehiscences. A computerized tomography scan showed evidence of significant peribronchial air collection in the pleural space and the mediastinum. Owing to a high predictive operative mortality, endobronchial management was planned, and 3 uncovered self-expanding metallic stents (Ultraflex, Boston Scientific Corp) were placed (in the left main stem bronchus, the anterior segment of the right upper lobe, and the right intermediate bronchus). At 5 weeks bronchoscopy showed complete healing of the dehiscences with granulation. The stents were then removed by rigid bronchoscopy. Three weeks after the stent removal a bronchoscopic examination showed a normal tracheobronchial tree except for a slightly narrowed right anastomosis. We conclude that short-term placement of uncovered self-expanding metallic stents provides a safe and minimally invasive option in the management of bilateral dehiscences."

Obstructive granulation tissue resulting in airway compromise is best treated with cold therapies, including cryodebridement or cryotherapy. Cryodebridement can be performed using the cryotherapy probe to freeze granulation tissue, followed by withdrawal of the probe with the tissue attached. 30 Cryotherapy, in contrast, involves repeated cycles of freezing and thawing of obstructing tissue. This process crystallizes tissue, causing microthrombi formation along with intracellular and extracellular ice crystal formation resulting in cell death. 31,32 In the weeks following cryotherapy, necrosing granulation tissue sloughs off the airway without damage to the bronchial wall.

Because balloon bronchoplasty stretches the airway circumferentially, the airway often returns to the original narrowed state over time. Instead, we recommend combining balloon bronchoplasty with radial incisions and steroid injections at the site of stenosis. Radial incisions allow tearing along the radial scores during dilation rather than mere circumferential stretching of the airway. Incisions are traditionally made at the 12 o ' clock, 8 o ' clock, and 4 o ' clock positions with an electrocautery knife or Nd:YAG laser.

Cryodebridement can be performed using the cryotherapy probe to freeze granulation tissue, followed by withdrawal of the probe with the tissue attached. 30 Cryotherapy, in contrast, involves repeated cycles of freezing and thawing of obstructing tissue.

Because balloon bronchoplasty stretches the airway circumferentially, the airway often returns to the original narrowed state over time. Instead, we recommend combining balloon bronchoplasty with radial incisions and steroid injections at the site of stenosis. Radial incisions allow tearing along the radial scores during dilation rather than mere circumferential stretching of the airway. Incisions are traditionally made at the 12 o ' clock, 8 o ' clock, and 4 o ' clock positions with an electrocautery knife or Nd:YAG laser.

Instead, we recommend combining balloon bronchoplasty with radial incisions and steroid injections at the site of stenosis. Radial incisions allow tearing along the radial scores during dilation rather than mere circumferential stretching of the airway. Incisions are traditionally made at the 12 o ' clock, 8 o ' clock, and 4 o ' clock positions with an electrocautery knife or Nd:YAG laser. Injection of corticosteroids into the airway mucosa using a Wang needle at the sites of radial incisions may reduce in /uniFB02 ammation and prevent restenosis. 41",

Cryodebridement can be performed using the cryotherapy probe to freeze granulation tissue, followed by withdrawal of the probe with the tissue attached. 30 Cryotherapy, in contrast, involves repeated cycles of freezing and thawing of obstructing tissue.

Because balloon bronchoplasty stretches the airway circumferentially, the airway often returns to the original narrowed state over time.
