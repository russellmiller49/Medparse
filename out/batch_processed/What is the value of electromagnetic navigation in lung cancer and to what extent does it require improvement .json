    "abstract": "Introduction : Lung nodules are being identified with increasing frequency. With this growing burden of nodules comes a growing need for diagnostic technologies extending beyond the current reach of conventional bronchoscopy. One such method for diagnosing peripheral lung lesions is electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy (ENB), which comprises a set of tools designed to aid the bronchoscopist in identifying, accessing, and sampling peripheral lung lesions under virtual guidance. Areas covered : Herein we present an in-depth review of ENB, including commercially available electromagnetic navigation platforms, factors influencing diagnostic yield, adjunctive imaging and biopsy tools, potential risks, cost, technical shortcomings, and competing technologies. A review of the scientific literature was conducted primarily through PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar, and pertinent publications and abstracts from the inception of electromagnetic navigation through early 2020 were considered. We also share our perspective on the future of ENB from both a diagnostic and a therapeutic standpoint. Expert opinion : ENB is currently a leading tool in the diagnostic evaluation of peripheral lung lesions. The future of ENB rests not only on its potential to expand into the therapeutic realm but also on its ability to keep pace with competing diagnostic and therapeutic technologies.

A study of trends in CT imaging from 2006 to 2012 determined that while the annual frequency of imaging increased from 1.3% to 1.9%, the percentage of scans identifying a lung nodule increased from 24% to 31% [1]. Despite supportive evidence for low-dose CT screening borne out of such trials as the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and Dutch-Belgian Randomized Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NELSON), a slim but slowly growing minority of eligible adults are currently being screened for lung cancer [2 -4]. As this number continues to rise, so too will the burden of suspicious lesions demanding clinical attention."

A unified algorithm proposed by the American College of Chest Physicians recommends biopsy for nodules >8 mm when the estimated probability of malignancy is low to moderate, discordance exists between radiographic findings and the probability of malignancy, a potential benign diagnosis requiring treatment is suspected, the risks of surgery are felt to be too high, or whenever a patient at a high probability of malignancy prefers diagnostic proof prior to undergoing resection [7]. When nonsurgical tissue-sampling is warranted, the two main routes are transthoracic and bronchoscopic: belonging to this latter category is electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy, or ENB. Further complicating this issue is the knowledge that the majority of suspicious lung nodules detected on CT ultimately turn out to be false-positives (non-neoplastic), comprising 96.4% of nodules detected in the NLST [4]. Therefore, the importance of choosing a diagnostic strategy that maximizes yield while minimizing harm is of paramount importance."

The number of airway-generations included in the autosegmented map is proportional to the quality of the scan, and some maps may not include the distalmost airways leading to the target. Therefore, the bronchoscopist may have to manually draw a path along several airway-generations before intersecting with an auto-segmented airway, at which point the software completes the pathway. The clinician then reviews the pathway and, based on their own interpretation of the scan, decides whether to accept it or attempt to plot a different one. The bronchoscopist may also view a ' simulated bronchoscopy ' along the pathway within the virtual airway map to get a better understanding of the anatomic approach to the lesion. In some systems, airway landmarks (for example, the main carina and a secondary carina within each lobe of both lungs) are tagged on the virtual airway map upon completion of planning. This process is required for performing a ' manual registration ' in the event that ' automatic registration ' is unsuccessful (described below)."

An electromagnetic field generator connected to the navigation system is positioned either above or underneath the patient and sensors are affixed to the patient ' s chest, enabling the system to generate an electromagnetic field around the patient. After anesthetic administration, bronchoscopic examination of the airways is performed to clear secretions and identify any potential endobronchial lesions that might interfere with (or obviate the need for) ENB. Depending on the system being used, registration is performed at this time. An extended working channel (EWC) is advanced into the airways via the working channel of the bronchoscope, and through this, a probe with electromagnetic coils in its tip is introduced into the airways: when the probe enters the electromagnetic field, current induced within its coils enables the EMN system to determine its threedimensional position within the field and depict that location on the virtual map. The bronchoscope and probe are maneuvered to prespecified locations (for example, the mid-trachea and each lobe bilaterally) so that the system can synchronize these anatomic landmarks within the patient to their corresponding locations on the virtual map (termed ' automatic registration ' ). If this is unsuccessful (due, for example, to interval-change in lung geometry from atelectasis), a ' manual registration ' is performed: the electromagnetic probe is put into direct contact with the anatomic reference-points that were tagged on the virtual map during the planning phase, and the system uses these landmarks to overlay the virtual map onto the patient within the electromagnetic field. A more detailed assessment of the lobe containing the target lesion may then be performed by advancing the EWC and probe into each segmental bronchus of that lobe, allowing the system to obtain more spatial information within the lobe of interest and improve the granularity of registration."

The tip of the Monarch bronchoscope is capable of omnidirectional angulation, allowing for more precise movements in comparison to either a conventional bronchoscope or an EWC. The Monarch bronchoscope is also slimmer than conventional therapeutic bronchoscopes, thereby enabling the bronchoscopist to maneuver more distally under direct visualization before having to rely on virtual navigation to traverse the remaining distance to the target lesion. As the bronchoscope houses the electromagnetic sensors, virtual views are maintained throughout the entire procedure. Lastly, the Monarch system does not require the use of proprietary biopsy tools and can accommodate any instrument under 2.1 mm in diameter and over 105.2 cm long."

Despite ' drop-off, ' there is nonetheless some association between successful navigation and successful biopsy. Early in the development of ENB, the term ' average fiducial target registration error ' (AFTRE) was coined to describe the difference between the expected and actual location of the EMN catheter at the completion of navigation. AFTRE has been used as a surrogate for successful navigation, and although data are not uniformly in agreement, several studies demonstrate an association between lower AFTRE and higher diagnostic yield [19,20].

When added to conventional bronchoscopy, the success of rEBUS-assisted biopsy of peripheral nodules ranges from under 60% to around 80% [12,16,17,34 -36]. In a randomized trial of ENB and rEBUS in 118 patients with peripheral nodules (mean diameter of 26 ± 6 mm), the diagnostic yield for ENB with rEBUS was significantly higher (88%) than for either ENB (59%) or rEBUS (69%) alone [12]. The AQuIRE registry also noted a higher yield when rEBUS was added to ENB after multivariate logistic regression [10]. Conversely, in NAVIGATE, the use of rEBUS did not significantly affect diagnostic yield after multivariate analysis [14]. There are several potential explanations for these conflicting results: regarding NAVIGATE and AQuIRE, their pragmatic designs did not dictate the circumstances under which a particular diagnostic modality could be used, and it has been postulated that clinicians may have preferentially resorted to one technology over the other, thereby relegating the other to only the most challenging cases. AQuIRE was a study of bronchoscopy overall (and not ENB specifically) for peripheral lung lesions, and it is possible that participating bronchoscopists may have used rEBUS preferentially and ENB only in more challenging cases. In contrast, NAVIGATE was a study of ENB specifically; therefore, it may be that, at least in some instances, rEBUS was added to ENB only when available, deemed potentially helpful, or success of navigation was in doubt."

This latter finding was supported in a recent analysis of NAVIGATE data showing that 86.8% of true-positive biopsies of malignant lesions were obtained using an ' extensive tool strategy ' (utilizing a greater array of biopsy instruments), as compared to 13.2% using a ' limited tool strategy ' (any combination of TBBx, standard cytology brushing, and BAL) [39]."

Brushings and TBBx may cause more bleeding than TBNA, while TBBx carries the highest risk of pneumothorax [40 -44]. Unlike other techniques, TBBx procures a sufficiently sized sample for histologic (rather than exclusively cytologic) evaluation. We commonly perform TBNA first in all ENB cases: if a diagnostic biopsy is obtained and the lesion is not clearly in a location where the risk of complications might be unacceptably high, then TBBx is generally performed next.

Nodule-movement secondary to respiratory motion was the focus of another study of 85 nodules in 46 patients, in which nodules moved a mean 17.6 mm as lung-volume changed from total lung capacity to functional residual capacity, with the degree of displacement being greater for nodules located in the lower versus upper lobes [31]. Compensation for respiratory variation was the impetus behind the Veran system ' s incorporation of end-inspiratory and end-expiratory images in the planning CT; however, studies demonstrating whether this influences outcomes have not been published."

Whether the mode of anesthesia impacts the success of navigation or diagnostic yield remains uncertain. A 2014 metaanalysis identified a higher diagnostic yield in studies that performed ENB under general anesthesia [18]. Contrastingly, several studies directly comparing the mode of anesthesia (moderate or deep sedation versus general anesthesia) during ENB found no significant difference in diagnostic yield [12,66,67]. Furthermore, NAVIGATE did not find the type of anesthesia to be a significant predictor of successful biopsy in logistic regression models [14]."

Regarding the last of these considerations, higher-pressure mechanical ventilation (whether through higher inspiratory pressures, positive end-expiratory pressure, or recruitment maneuvers) and judicious limitation of the fraction of inspired oxygen (to minimize the potential for resorption atelectasis) have been promoted to varying degrees; however, published data in support of one ventilatory strategy over another remain limited. Interestingly, a recent publication comparing jet ventilation to conventional lung-protective volume ventilation found that the use of jet ventilation resulted in significantly less spatial displacement from the tip of the EMN catheter to the target lesion (2 mm versus 17 mm, P < 0.05) and a significantly higher diagnostic yield (54% versus 43%, P < 0.05) among patients lacking an airway leading directly to the target lesion [68].

In a prospective study of CBCT with ultrathin bronchoscopy and rEBUS (without ENB) for localization of peripheral nodules with a mean diameter of 2.1 cm, bronchoscopic adjustments based on intraprocedural CBCT improved diagnostic yield from 50% to 70% (P = 0.04) [71]. In a prospective study combining CBCT with ENB in eight patients with peripheral nodules averaging 1.34 cm in diameter, navigational success was 100%, CBCT confirmed the biopsy instrument within the lesion in 7 of 8 cases, and a definitive diagnosis of cancer was made in 3 of 8 cases [72].",

Another prospective study of 50 patients (61.2% of lesions < 20 mm and 46.9% without a bronchus sign) showed that after performing local registration with the superDimension ' s fluoroscopic navigation platform, the number of cases in which there was overlap in target location as determined by EMN and CBCT rose from 68.3% to 95.1%, with an overall diagnostic biopsy rate of 63.3% [75]."

Although ENB has become a central diagnostic modality in the bronchoscopist ' s armamentarium, it could just as easily fall from favor as other tools with similar (or greater) efficacy and fewer shortcomings become available. Everslimmer bronchoscopes may ultimately enable the clinician to get within biopsy-range of peripheral targets without the need for virtual guidance [76]. Just as the convex Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscope revolutionized the interrogation of central lesions and lymph nodes, so too might an ultrathin Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscope change the face of peripheral lung nodule-sampling [77]. Standalone fluoroscopic navigation (LungVision platform, BodyVision Medical) (Figure 11) has already shown promise as a tool for accessing peripheral lesions while providing some degree of real-time compensation for CT-to-body divergence, and although fluoroscopic navigation is incorporated into the newest version of the superDimension system, it has yet to be determined whether combining the two technologies offers significant benefit over fluoroscopic navigation alone [78 -80]. Lastly, in the field of robotic bronchoscopy, the Ion system (Intuitive Surgical) employs a thin (3.5-mm outer diameter) bronchoscope with fiberoptic positional sensing (rather positional localization within an electromagnetic field) for guided navigation to peripheral targets. The proprietary positional sensing technology also enables the bronchoscope to hold its position more effectively and compensate for movement at the distal tip during the",

Because of these factors -and in light of our growing understanding of changes that occur in lung geometry under conditions of general anesthesia, mechanical ventilation, and bronchoscopy itself that likely increase the probability of unsuccessful navigation and biopsy -we highly recommend prioritizing ENB (or other nodule-sampling techniques) over lymph node assessment in clinical scenarios where a diagnosis other than primary lung cancer is being considered. Similarly, in situations where ENB or comparable diagnostic techniques are unavailable, patients who fit the above criteria should be referred to a provider or facility capable of providing the appropriate services. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided lymph node evaluation should not be viewed as an acceptable alternative in such situations when timely referral is feasible, as negative or nondiagnostic results of lymph node sampling may not obviate the need to pursue the peripheral nodule, and would therefore result in the patient being subjected to two separate diagnostic procedures (and their associated risks and costs) rather than potentially one."

The study was conducted in a tertiary medical centre on 40 consecutive patients considered unsuitable for straightforward surgery or computed tomography (CT)-guided transthoracic needle aspiration biopsy, due to comorbidities. The lung lesion diameter was mean+/-sem 23.5+/-1.5 mm and the depth from the visceral-costal pleura was 14.9+/-2 mm. Navigation was facilitated by an electromagnetic tracking system which could detect a position sensor incorporated into a flexible catheter advanced through a bronchoscope. Information obtained during bronchoscopy was superimposed on previously acquired CT data. Divergence between CT data and data obtained during bronchoscopy was calculated by the system's software as a measure of navigational accuracy. All but one of the target lesions was reached and the overall diagnostic yield was 62.5% (25-40). Diagnostic yield was significantly affected by CT-to-body divergence; yield was 77.2% when estimated divergence was &lt;or=4 mm. Three pneumothoraces occurred and chest drainage was required in one case. Electromagnetic navigation-guided bronchoscopy has the potential to improve the diagnostic yield of transbronchial biopsies without additional fluoroscopic guidance, and may be useful in the early diagnosis of lung cancer, particularly in nonoperable patients."

If nonsurgical biopsy techniques are considered, deciding between bronchoscopic transbronchial versus computed tomography-guided transthoracic biopsy can be difficult. The former has a low diagnostic yield with a low complication risk, whereas the latter has a better diagnostic yield but a higher complication rate. Investigators have looked at various lesion characteristics that can predict the diagnostic yield of guided bronchoscopic biopsies. Although consensus exists that larger size and proximity to the hilum increase the diagnostic yield, there is ongoing debate about the association between computed tomography bronchus sign (air-filled bronchus in close proximity of the lesion as seen on computed tomography imaging) and the diagnostic yield of guided bronchoscopic modalities."

Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) is a relatively new technique, which uses an image guided localization system to direct steerable bronchoscopic tools to predetermined points within the bronchial tree. This technology allows improved access to peripheral lesions in particular. We investigated the sensitivity and specificity of ENB-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) in the diagnosis of lung lesions. All ENB-guided FNAs performed at one institution were included in the study. The superDimension i-Logic System&#x2122; was used in all cases. Pathologic reports of the ENB-guided FNAs, as well as all other pulmonary sampling performed simultaneously with the FNA and within 1 year of the ENB-guided FNA were reviewed. Patients with a positive ENB-guided FNA or malignancy within the same lobe within the follow-up period were considered positive for malignancy. Patients with an atypical diagnosis but no definitive malignancy were considered negative for malignancy for statistical purposes. Ninety-one patients underwent 95 ENB-guided FNAs over a 3-year period. Thirty-five patients (38%) were positive for malignancy. ENB-guided FNA had a sensitivity of 63% for the detection of malignancy. The sensitivity for the detection of malignancy using all ENB-guided sampling methods, including FNA, bronchoscopic biopsy, and bronchial brushing was 83%. Pathologists and cytotechnologists should be aware of ENB-guided FNA as an emerging technology with a relatively high sensitivity for the diagnosis of peripheral lung lesions."

For these procedures, a thin-slice chest CT scan is performed prior to bronchoscopy at full inspiration and is used to create virtual airway reconstructions that are used as a map during bronchoscopy. Movement of the lung occurs with respiratory variation during bronchoscopy, and the location of pulmonary nodules during procedures may differ significantly from their location on the initial planning full-inspiratory chest CT scan. This study was performed to quantify pulmonary nodule movement from full inspiration to end-exhalation during tidal volume breathing in patients undergoing electromagnetic navigation procedures."

The CT is traditionally done at a full inspiratory breath hold (INSP), but the procedure is performed while the patient tidal breaths, when lung&#xa0;volumes are closer to functional residual capacity. Movement of a PN from INSP to expiration (EXP) has been shown to average 17.6&#xa0;mm. Therefore, the hypothesis of this study is that preprocedural virtual maps built off a CT closer to physiological lung volumes during bronchoscopy may better represent the actual 3D location of a PN."

This feasibility study aimed to assess the ability of endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) to provide imaging guidance for TBBX. In a prospective study, 50 consecutive patients referred for TBBX for peripheral lesions underwent fluoroscopy-guided and EBUS-guided TBBX in random order. Diagnostic yields were compared for both modalities and feasibility was assessed for EBUS. Diagnostic material was obtained in 80% of patients with EBUS and 76% of patients with fluoroscopy. There was a nonsignificant trend for EBUS to be better than fluoroscopy for lesions &lt;3 cm in diameter. Four lesions could not be visualised with EBUS. There were no significant complications associated with the use of EBUS. Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial biopsy is feasible. It appears to be at least equivalent to fluoroscopy without the accompanying radiation exposure. Further large-scale studies are indicated to assess the possible role of endobronchial ultrasound as a potential imaging method of choice for the biopsy of peripheral lung lesions."

In several cases pneumothorax (PNTX) is induced and immediate action is needed. Both radiologists and pulmonary physicians can insert a chest tube for symptom relief. However; only pulmonary physicians and thoracic surgeons can provide a permanent solution for the patient. The final solution would be for a patient to undergo surgery for a final solution. In our current work we will provide all those diagnostic cases where PNTX is induced and treatment from the point of view of expert radiologists and pulmonary physicians."

        "abstract": "Although, bronchoscopy is a relatively safe procedure, small amount of bleeding in the airway can have serious consequences. Careful consideration of the risks of diagnostic and therapeutic bronchoscopic intervention can help minimize potential complications. With increasing number of patients using antiplatelet and anticoagulation therapies, strategies for minimizing thromboembolic and operative bleeding events need to be included in the risk and benefit analyses. Growing evidence suggests that aspirin is safe and does not increase bleeding during bronchoscopy. In addition, despite small studies reporting that it may be safe to perform bronchoscopic procedures that have low risk for bleeding such as endobronchial ultrasound with transbronchial needle aspiration on clopidogrel, it is still recommended to hold it for 7 days prior to performing elective bronchoscopy. It is recommended to hold vitamin K antagonist, as well as new oral anticoagulation agents prior to bronchoscopy. The timing for pre-procedural discontinuation of anticoagulation therapy and the decision to bridge depend on the agent used, the renal function and the thromboembolic risk. In this review article, we will discuss available data regarding management of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy as it applies to bronchoscopic procedures."

        "abstract": "Bleeding is one of the most feared complications of flexible bronchoscopy. Although infrequent, it can be catastrophic and result in fatal outcomes. Compared to other endoscopic procedures, the risk of morbidity and mortality from the bleeding is increased, as even a small amount of blood can fill the tracheobronchial tree and lead to respiratory failure. Patients using antithrombotic agents (ATAs) have higher bleeding risk. A thorough understanding of the different ATAs is critical to manage patients during the peri-procedural period. A decision to stop an ATA before bronchoscopy should take into account a variety of factors, including indication for its use and the type of procedure. This article serves as a detailed review on the different ATAs, their pharmacokinetics and the pre- and post-bronchoscopy management of patients receiving these medications."

Life-threatening bleeding, however, can occur, especially after conventional or cryoprobe-assisted transbronchial biopsy. The aim of this review is to provide the practising pulmonologist with a concise overview of the incidence, severity and risk factors for bleeding, to provide sensible advice on prophylactic measures and to suggest a plan of action in the case of significant bleeding. Bronchoscopy units should have a standardised approach and plan of action in the case of life-threatening haemorrhage. Wedging the bronchoscope in the bleeding segment, turning the patient in an anti-Trendelenburg position and onto the side in order for the bleeding lung to be in the dependent position, installing vasoconstrictors and using a tamponade balloon early are the recommended first-line strategies. Involving a resuscitation team should be considered early in the case of massive bleeding, desaturation and haemodynamic instability."

Navigation is performed in a magnetic field and, therefore, has been considered relatively contraindicated in patients with pacemakers and automated implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (AICDs). Potential risks include altering the function and shutting off the device, device damage, lead displacement, and potential overheating. Over the past decade, there has been extensive literature about the safety of pacemakers in either the 1.5-T or 3-T magnetic fields used in current MRI scanners. Although the magnetic field used in ENB is significantly weaker, 0.0001 T or approximately equal to the earth's gravity, its safety in patients with pacemakers is yet to be elucidated. We present our initial experience with ENB in patients with cardiac implanted electrical devices."

The greatest weakness of ENB-based guidance is the registration divergence that exists between the planning CT, acquired days or weeks before the intervention, and the patient on the table on the day of the intervention. Augmenting ENB guidance with real-time tomosynthesis imaging during the intervention could mitigate the divergence and further improve the yield of ENB-guided transbronchial biopsies. The real-time tomosynthesis prototype, the scanning-beam digital x-ray (SBDX) system, does not currently display images reconstructed by the iterative algorithm that was developed for this lung imaging application. A protocol using fiducial markers was therefore implemented to permit evaluation of potential improvements that would be provided by the SBDX system in a clinical setting."

Chest computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) were performed before and after RFA to assess the ablation response of the patients. One patient's tumor had no prior PET uptake and therefore no follow-up PET was obtained. The first and the third patient obtained partial response to RFA, and the second patient obtained complete response 3 months after RFA. The first patient developed progressive disease 6 months after RFA. The second and the third patient achieved one-year progression-free survival. No significant complications occurred in the 3 patients. Navigation bronchoscopy-guided RFA is a safe and feasible procedure for poor surgical candidates with stage IA lung cancer or lung metastasis."

        "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide and lobectomy remains the standard of care for patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The combination of an aging population and the implementation of low-dose CT for lung cancer screening is leading to an increase in diagnosis of early stage NSCLC in medically \"inoperable\" patients. The recommended treatment for this latter group of patients is stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). However, many patients cannot undergo SBRT because they have received prior radiation or because the tumor is located next to vital structures. Percutaneous ablative therapies have become an alternative to SBRT but, unfortunately, they all violate the pleura and are associated with high rate of pneumothorax. With a more favorable safety profile and the ability to provide also diagnosis and nodal staging, bronchoscopic ablation is hence emerging as a potential future therapeutic alternative for these patients. Herein we review the current state of the art including animal and human data that exists thus far. We also discuss technical and research challenges as well as future directions that this exciting new technology may take."

When nonsurgical tissue-sampling is warranted, the two main routes are transthoracic and bronchoscopic: belonging to this latter category is electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy, or ENB. Further complicating this issue is the knowledge that the majority of suspicious lung nodules detected on CT ultimately turn out to be false-positives (non-neoplastic), comprising 96.4% of nodules detected in the NLST [4]. Therefore, the importance of choosing a diagnostic strategy that maximizes yield while minimizing harm is of paramount importance.",

The earliest EMN systems were developed in the 1990s for stereotactic sampling of occult brain lesions. Advances in chest CT in the late 1990s and 2000s made it possible to render threedimensional reconstructions of the airways, thereby opening the way to EMN in the lungs, and in 2006 the first successful clinical experience with electromagnetic bronchoscopy (ENB) in humans was published [8].",

When the path intersects with an airway included in the auto-segmented map, the software automatically completes the path from that point back to the trachea. The number of airway-generations included in the autosegmented map is proportional to the quality of the scan, and some maps may not include the distalmost airways leading to the target. Therefore, the bronchoscopist may have to manually draw a path along several airway-generations before intersecting with an auto-segmented airway, at which point the software completes the pathway. The clinician then reviews the pathway and, based on their own interpretation of the scan, decides whether to accept it or attempt to plot a different one. The bronchoscopist may also view a ' simulated bronchoscopy ' along the pathway within the virtual airway map to get a better understanding of the anatomic approach to the lesion. In some systems, airway landmarks (for example, the main carina and a secondary carina within each lobe of both lungs) are tagged on the virtual airway map upon completion of planning.

Similar observations have been made with ENB and other peripheral techniques, where published rates of successful navigation (defined as the ability to navigate within a predetermined distance of the target) typically exceed 90% but diagnostic yield tends to be some 20 percentage points lower [11,15,18]. Despite ' drop-off, ' there is nonetheless some association between successful navigation and successful biopsy. Early in the development of ENB, the term ' average fiducial target registration error ' (AFTRE) was coined to describe the difference between the expected and actual location of the EMN catheter at the completion of navigation. AFTRE has been used as a surrogate for successful navigation, and although data are not uniformly in agreement, several studies demonstrate an association between lower AFTRE and higher diagnostic yield [19,20].

This latter finding was supported in a recent analysis of NAVIGATE data showing that 86.8% of true-positive biopsies of malignant lesions were obtained using an ' extensive tool strategy ' (utilizing a greater array of biopsy instruments), as compared to 13.2% using a ' limited tool strategy ' (any combination of TBBx, standard cytology brushing, and BAL) [39].",

In a more recent single-center study examining overarching costs (including those associated with anesthesiology and hospitalization) from 49 consecutive ENB and 77 consecutive TTNA procedures, the base proceduralist cost for ENB and TTNA was 5,248 USD and 1,476, USD, respectively, while the average total per-procedure cost was 14,923 USD for ENB and 4,764 USD for TTNA. It bears mentioning that the average length-of-hospitalization for patients undergoing ENB was thrice as high as for TTNA (6 versus 2 days) for unspecified reasons, further adding to the cost of ENB [63]. Ultimately, the cost of ENB likely varies along a variety of parameters including the capital cost of different EMN systems, costs of adjunctive instruments or technologies, pricing of non-reusable components, facility fees, and anesthesiaassociated costs.",

Tomosynthesis may be repeated during the navigation process, and changes in lesion-position relative to the fiducial landmarks are used to update the registration (termed ' local registration ' ). The EMN software subsequently uses local registration data to update the navigation path. Current data on the integration of fluoroscopic navigation into ENB are promising: a recent comparison of ENB using the superDimension system with or without fluoroscopic navigation and local registration showed a significantly higher diagnostic yield when intraprocedural local registration was used (79.1% versus 55.3%, P = 0.0015) [74]. Another prospective study of 50 patients (61.2% of lesions < 20 mm and 46.9% without a bronchus sign) showed that after performing local registration with the superDimension ' s fluoroscopic navigation platform, the number of cases in which there was overlap in target location as determined by EMN and CBCT rose from 68.3% to 95.1%, with an overall diagnostic biopsy rate of 63.3% [75].",

Because of these factors -and in light of our growing understanding of changes that occur in lung geometry under conditions of general anesthesia, mechanical ventilation, and bronchoscopy itself that likely increase the probability of unsuccessful navigation and biopsy -we highly recommend prioritizing ENB (or other nodule-sampling techniques) over lymph node assessment in clinical scenarios where a diagnosis other than primary lung cancer is being considered. Similarly, in situations where ENB or comparable diagnostic techniques are unavailable, patients who fit the above criteria should be referred to a provider or facility capable of providing the appropriate services. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided lymph node evaluation should not be viewed as an acceptable alternative in such situations when timely referral is feasible, as negative or nondiagnostic results of lymph node sampling may not obviate the need to pursue the peripheral nodule, and would therefore result in the patient being subjected to two separate diagnostic procedures (and their associated risks and costs) rather than potentially one."

Similarly, in situations where ENB or comparable diagnostic techniques are unavailable, patients who fit the above criteria should be referred to a provider or facility capable of providing the appropriate services. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided lymph node evaluation should not be viewed as an acceptable alternative in such situations when timely referral is feasible, as negative or nondiagnostic results of lymph node sampling may not obviate the need to pursue the peripheral nodule, and would therefore result in the patient being subjected to two separate diagnostic procedures (and their associated risks and costs) rather than potentially one."

Similarly, in situations where ENB or comparable diagnostic techniques are unavailable, patients who fit the above criteria should be referred to a provider or facility capable of providing the appropriate services.

Despite ' drop-off, ' there is nonetheless some association between successful navigation and successful biopsy. Early in the development of ENB, the term ' average fiducial target registration error ' (AFTRE) was coined to describe the difference between the expected and actual location of the EMN catheter at the completion of navigation. AFTRE has been used as a surrogate for successful navigation, and although data are not uniformly in agreement, several studies demonstrate an association between lower AFTRE and higher diagnostic yield [19,20].

This latter finding was supported in a recent analysis of NAVIGATE data showing that 86.8% of true-positive biopsies of malignant lesions were obtained using an ' extensive tool strategy ' (utilizing a greater array of biopsy instruments), as compared to 13.2% using a ' limited tool strategy ' (any combination of TBBx, standard cytology brushing, and BAL) [39].",

It bears mentioning that the average length-of-hospitalization for patients undergoing ENB was thrice as high as for TTNA (6 versus 2 days) for unspecified reasons, further adding to the cost of ENB [63].

Current data on the integration of fluoroscopic navigation into ENB are promising: a recent comparison of ENB using the superDimension system with or without fluoroscopic navigation and local registration showed a significantly higher diagnostic yield when intraprocedural local registration was used (79.1% versus 55.3%, P = 0.0015) [74]. Another prospective study of 50 patients (61.2% of lesions < 20 mm and 46.9% without a bronchus sign) showed that after performing local registration with the superDimension ' s fluoroscopic navigation platform, the number of cases in which there was overlap in target location as determined by EMN and CBCT rose from 68.3% to 95.1%, with an overall diagnostic biopsy rate of 63.3% [75].",

Because of these factors -and in light of our growing understanding of changes that occur in lung geometry under conditions of general anesthesia, mechanical ventilation, and bronchoscopy itself that likely increase the probability of unsuccessful navigation and biopsy -we highly recommend prioritizing ENB (or other nodule-sampling techniques) over lymph node assessment in clinical scenarios where a diagnosis other than primary lung cancer is being considered. Similarly, in situations where ENB or comparable diagnostic techniques are unavailable, patients who fit the above criteria should be referred to a provider or facility capable of providing the appropriate services. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided lymph node evaluation should not be viewed as an acceptable alternative in such situations when timely referral is feasible, as negative or nondiagnostic results of lymph node sampling may not obviate the need to pursue the peripheral nodule, and would therefore result in the patient being subjected to two separate diagnostic procedures (and their associated risks and costs) rather than potentially one."

Despite ' drop-off, ' there is nonetheless some association between successful navigation and successful biopsy. Early in the development of ENB, the term ' average fiducial target registration error ' (AFTRE) was coined to describe the difference between the expected and actual location of the EMN catheter at the completion of navigation. AFTRE has been used as a surrogate for successful navigation, and although data are not uniformly in agreement, several studies demonstrate an association between lower AFTRE and higher diagnostic yield [19,20].

This latter finding was supported in a recent analysis of NAVIGATE data showing that 86.8% of true-positive biopsies of malignant lesions were obtained using an ' extensive tool strategy ' (utilizing a greater array of biopsy instruments), as compared to 13.2% using a ' limited tool strategy ' (any combination of TBBx, standard cytology brushing, and BAL) [39].",

It bears mentioning that the average length-of-hospitalization for patients undergoing ENB was thrice as high as for TTNA (6 versus 2 days) for unspecified reasons, further adding to the cost of ENB [63].

Current data on the integration of fluoroscopic navigation into ENB are promising: a recent comparison of ENB using the superDimension system with or without fluoroscopic navigation and local registration showed a significantly higher diagnostic yield when intraprocedural local registration was used (79.1% versus 55.3%, P = 0.0015) [74].

Because of these factors -and in light of our growing understanding of changes that occur in lung geometry under conditions of general anesthesia, mechanical ventilation, and bronchoscopy itself that likely increase the probability of unsuccessful navigation and biopsy -we highly recommend prioritizing ENB (or other nodule-sampling techniques) over lymph node assessment in clinical scenarios where a diagnosis other than primary lung cancer is being considered. Similarly, in situations where ENB or comparable diagnostic techniques are unavailable, patients who fit the above criteria should be referred to a provider or facility capable of providing the appropriate services. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided lymph node evaluation should not be viewed as an acceptable alternative in such situations when timely referral is feasible, as negative or nondiagnostic results of lymph node sampling may not obviate the need to pursue the peripheral nodule, and would therefore result in the patient being subjected to two separate diagnostic procedures (and their associated risks and costs) rather than potentially one."

When nonsurgical tissue-sampling is warranted, the two main routes are transthoracic and bronchoscopic: belonging to this latter category is electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy, or ENB. Further complicating this issue is the knowledge that the majority of suspicious lung nodules detected on CT ultimately turn out to be false-positives (non-neoplastic), comprising 96.4% of nodules detected in the NLST [4].

Similarly, in situations where ENB or comparable diagnostic techniques are unavailable, patients who fit the above criteria should be referred to a provider or facility capable of providing the appropriate services. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided lymph node evaluation should not be viewed as an acceptable alternative in such situations when timely referral is feasible, as negative or nondiagnostic results of lymph node sampling may not obviate the need to pursue the peripheral nodule, and would therefore result in the patient being subjected to two separate diagnostic procedures (and their associated risks and costs) rather than potentially one."

Similarly, in situations where ENB or comparable diagnostic techniques are unavailable, patients who fit the above criteria should be referred to a provider or facility capable of providing the appropriate services. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided lymph node evaluation should not be viewed as an acceptable alternative in such situations when timely referral is feasible, as negative or nondiagnostic results of lymph node sampling may not obviate the need to pursue the peripheral nodule, and would therefore result in the patient being subjected to two separate diagnostic procedures (and their associated risks and costs) rather than potentially one."

Early in the development of ENB, the term ' average fiducial target registration error ' (AFTRE) was coined to describe the difference between the expected and actual location of the EMN catheter at the completion of navigation. AFTRE has been used as a surrogate for successful navigation, and although data are not uniformly in agreement, several studies demonstrate an association between lower AFTRE and higher diagnostic yield [19,20].

This latter finding was supported in a recent analysis of NAVIGATE data showing that 86.8% of true-positive biopsies of malignant lesions were obtained using an ' extensive tool strategy ' (utilizing a greater array of biopsy instruments), as compared to 13.2% using a ' limited tool strategy ' (any combination of TBBx, standard cytology brushing, and BAL) [39].",

It bears mentioning that the average length-of-hospitalization for patients undergoing ENB was thrice as high as for TTNA (6 versus 2 days) for unspecified reasons, further adding to the cost of ENB [63].

Because of these factors -and in light of our growing understanding of changes that occur in lung geometry under conditions of general anesthesia, mechanical ventilation, and bronchoscopy itself that likely increase the probability of unsuccessful navigation and biopsy -we highly recommend prioritizing ENB (or other nodule-sampling techniques) over lymph node assessment in clinical scenarios where a diagnosis other than primary lung cancer is being considered. Similarly, in situations where ENB or comparable diagnostic techniques are unavailable, patients who fit the above criteria should be referred to a provider or facility capable of providing the appropriate services. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided lymph node evaluation should not be viewed as an acceptable alternative in such situations when timely referral is feasible, as negative or nondiagnostic results of lymph node sampling may not obviate the need to pursue the peripheral nodule, and would therefore result in the patient being subjected to two separate diagnostic procedures (and their associated risks and costs) rather than potentially one."

Despite ' drop-off, ' there is nonetheless some association between successful navigation and successful biopsy. Early in the development of ENB, the term ' average fiducial target registration error ' (AFTRE) was coined to describe the difference between the expected and actual location of the EMN catheter at the completion of navigation. AFTRE has been used as a surrogate for successful navigation, and although data are not uniformly in agreement, several studies demonstrate an association between lower AFTRE and higher diagnostic yield [19,20].

This latter finding was supported in a recent analysis of NAVIGATE data showing that 86.8% of true-positive biopsies of malignant lesions were obtained using an ' extensive tool strategy ' (utilizing a greater array of biopsy instruments), as compared to 13.2% using a ' limited tool strategy ' (any combination of TBBx, standard cytology brushing, and BAL) [39].",

It bears mentioning that the average length-of-hospitalization for patients undergoing ENB was thrice as high as for TTNA (6 versus 2 days) for unspecified reasons, further adding to the cost of ENB [63].

Tomosynthesis may be repeated during the navigation process, and changes in lesion-position relative to the fiducial landmarks are used to update the registration (termed ' local registration ' ). The EMN software subsequently uses local registration data to update the navigation path. Current data on the integration of fluoroscopic navigation into ENB are promising: a recent comparison of ENB using the superDimension system with or without fluoroscopic navigation and local registration showed a significantly higher diagnostic yield when intraprocedural local registration was used (79.1% versus 55.3%, P = 0.0015) [74]. Another prospective study of 50 patients (61.2% of lesions < 20 mm and 46.9% without a bronchus sign) showed that after performing local registration with the superDimension ' s fluoroscopic navigation platform, the number of cases in which there was overlap in target location as determined by EMN and CBCT rose from 68.3% to 95.1%, with an overall diagnostic biopsy rate of 63.3% [75].",

Because of these factors -and in light of our growing understanding of changes that occur in lung geometry under conditions of general anesthesia, mechanical ventilation, and bronchoscopy itself that likely increase the probability of unsuccessful navigation and biopsy -we highly recommend prioritizing ENB (or other nodule-sampling techniques) over lymph node assessment in clinical scenarios where a diagnosis other than primary lung cancer is being considered. Similarly, in situations where ENB or comparable diagnostic techniques are unavailable, patients who fit the above criteria should be referred to a provider or facility capable of providing the appropriate services. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided lymph node evaluation should not be viewed as an acceptable alternative in such situations when timely referral is feasible, as negative or nondiagnostic results of lymph node sampling may not obviate the need to pursue the peripheral nodule, and would therefore result in the patient being subjected to two separate diagnostic procedures (and their associated risks and costs) rather than potentially one."

Despite ' drop-off, ' there is nonetheless some association between successful navigation and successful biopsy. Early in the development of ENB, the term ' average fiducial target registration error ' (AFTRE) was coined to describe the difference between the expected and actual location of the EMN catheter at the completion of navigation. AFTRE has been used as a surrogate for successful navigation, and although data are not uniformly in agreement, several studies demonstrate an association between lower AFTRE and higher diagnostic yield [19,20].

This latter finding was supported in a recent analysis of NAVIGATE data showing that 86.8% of true-positive biopsies of malignant lesions were obtained using an ' extensive tool strategy ' (utilizing a greater array of biopsy instruments), as compared to 13.2% using a ' limited tool strategy ' (any combination of TBBx, standard cytology brushing, and BAL) [39].",

It bears mentioning that the average length-of-hospitalization for patients undergoing ENB was thrice as high as for TTNA (6 versus 2 days) for unspecified reasons, further adding to the cost of ENB [63].

Current data on the integration of fluoroscopic navigation into ENB are promising: a recent comparison of ENB using the superDimension system with or without fluoroscopic navigation and local registration showed a significantly higher diagnostic yield when intraprocedural local registration was used (79.1% versus 55.3%, P = 0.0015) [74]. Another prospective study of 50 patients (61.2% of lesions < 20 mm and 46.9% without a bronchus sign) showed that after performing local registration with the superDimension ' s fluoroscopic navigation platform, the number of cases in which there was overlap in target location as determined by EMN and CBCT rose from 68.3% to 95.1%, with an overall diagnostic biopsy rate of 63.3% [75].",

Because of these factors -and in light of our growing understanding of changes that occur in lung geometry under conditions of general anesthesia, mechanical ventilation, and bronchoscopy itself that likely increase the probability of unsuccessful navigation and biopsy -we highly recommend prioritizing ENB (or other nodule-sampling techniques) over lymph node assessment in clinical scenarios where a diagnosis other than primary lung cancer is being considered. Similarly, in situations where ENB or comparable diagnostic techniques are unavailable, patients who fit the above criteria should be referred to a provider or facility capable of providing the appropriate services. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided lymph node evaluation should not be viewed as an acceptable alternative in such situations when timely referral is feasible, as negative or nondiagnostic results of lymph node sampling may not obviate the need to pursue the peripheral nodule, and would therefore result in the patient being subjected to two separate diagnostic procedures (and their associated risks and costs) rather than potentially one."

Because of these factors -and in light of our growing understanding of changes that occur in lung geometry under conditions of general anesthesia, mechanical ventilation, and bronchoscopy itself that likely increase the probability of unsuccessful navigation and biopsy -we highly recommend prioritizing ENB (or other nodule-sampling techniques) over lymph node assessment in clinical scenarios where a diagnosis other than primary lung cancer is being considered. Similarly, in situations where ENB or comparable diagnostic techniques are unavailable, patients who fit the above criteria should be referred to a provider or facility capable of providing the appropriate services. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided lymph node evaluation should not be viewed as an acceptable alternative in such situations when timely referral is feasible, as negative or nondiagnostic results of lymph node sampling may not obviate the need to pursue the peripheral nodule, and would therefore result in the patient being subjected to two separate diagnostic procedures (and their associated risks and costs) rather than potentially one."

This latter finding was supported in a recent analysis of NAVIGATE data showing that 86.8% of true-positive biopsies of malignant lesions were obtained using an ' extensive tool strategy ' (utilizing a greater array of biopsy instruments), as compared to 13.2% using a ' limited tool strategy ' (any combination of TBBx, standard cytology brushing, and BAL) [39].",

In a more recent single-center study examining overarching costs (including those associated with anesthesiology and hospitalization) from 49 consecutive ENB and 77 consecutive TTNA procedures, the base proceduralist cost for ENB and TTNA was 5,248 USD and 1,476, USD, respectively, while the average total per-procedure cost was 14,923 USD for ENB and 4,764 USD for TTNA. It bears mentioning that the average length-of-hospitalization for patients undergoing ENB was thrice as high as for TTNA (6 versus 2 days) for unspecified reasons, further adding to the cost of ENB [63].

The EMN software subsequently uses local registration data to update the navigation path. Current data on the integration of fluoroscopic navigation into ENB are promising: a recent comparison of ENB using the superDimension system with or without fluoroscopic navigation and local registration showed a significantly higher diagnostic yield when intraprocedural local registration was used (79.1% versus 55.3%, P = 0.0015) [74]. Another prospective study of 50 patients (61.2% of lesions < 20 mm and 46.9% without a bronchus sign) showed that after performing local registration with the superDimension ' s fluoroscopic navigation platform, the number of cases in which there was overlap in target location as determined by EMN and CBCT rose from 68.3% to 95.1%, with an overall diagnostic biopsy rate of 63.3% [75].",

Because of these factors -and in light of our growing understanding of changes that occur in lung geometry under conditions of general anesthesia, mechanical ventilation, and bronchoscopy itself that likely increase the probability of unsuccessful navigation and biopsy -we highly recommend prioritizing ENB (or other nodule-sampling techniques) over lymph node assessment in clinical scenarios where a diagnosis other than primary lung cancer is being considered. Similarly, in situations where ENB or comparable diagnostic techniques are unavailable, patients who fit the above criteria should be referred to a provider or facility capable of providing the appropriate services. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided lymph node evaluation should not be viewed as an acceptable alternative in such situations when timely referral is feasible, as negative or nondiagnostic results of lymph node sampling may not obviate the need to pursue the peripheral nodule, and would therefore result in the patient being subjected to two separate diagnostic procedures (and their associated risks and costs) rather than potentially one."

A unified algorithm proposed by the American College of Chest Physicians recommends biopsy for nodules >8 mm when the estimated probability of malignancy is low to moderate, discordance exists between radiographic findings and the probability of malignancy, a potential benign diagnosis requiring treatment is suspected, the risks of surgery are felt to be too high, or whenever a patient at a high probability of malignancy prefers diagnostic proof prior to undergoing resection [7]. When nonsurgical tissue-sampling is warranted, the two main routes are transthoracic and bronchoscopic: belonging to this latter category is electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy, or ENB. Further complicating this issue is the knowledge that the majority of suspicious lung nodules detected on CT ultimately turn out to be false-positives (non-neoplastic), comprising 96.4% of nodules detected in the NLST [4]. Therefore, the importance of choosing a diagnostic strategy that maximizes yield while minimizing harm is of paramount importance.",

The earliest EMN systems were developed in the 1990s for stereotactic sampling of occult brain lesions. Advances in chest CT in the late 1990s and 2000s made it possible to render threedimensional reconstructions of the airways, thereby opening the way to EMN in the lungs, and in 2006 the first successful clinical experience with electromagnetic bronchoscopy (ENB) in humans was published [8].",

When the path intersects with an airway included in the auto-segmented map, the software automatically completes the path from that point back to the trachea. The number of airway-generations included in the autosegmented map is proportional to the quality of the scan, and some maps may not include the distalmost airways leading to the target. Therefore, the bronchoscopist may have to manually draw a path along several airway-generations before intersecting with an auto-segmented airway, at which point the software completes the pathway. The clinician then reviews the pathway and, based on their own interpretation of the scan, decides whether to accept it or attempt to plot a different one. The bronchoscopist may also view a ' simulated bronchoscopy ' along the pathway within the virtual airway map to get a better understanding of the anatomic approach to the lesion. In some systems, airway landmarks (for example, the main carina and a secondary carina within each lobe of both lungs) are tagged on the virtual airway map upon completion of planning. This process is required for performing a ' manual registration ' in the event that ' automatic registration ' is unsuccessful (described below).",

Similar observations have been made with ENB and other peripheral techniques, where published rates of successful navigation (defined as the ability to navigate within a predetermined distance of the target) typically exceed 90% but diagnostic yield tends to be some 20 percentage points lower [11,15,18]. Despite ' drop-off, ' there is nonetheless some association between successful navigation and successful biopsy. Early in the development of ENB, the term ' average fiducial target registration error ' (AFTRE) was coined to describe the difference between the expected and actual location of the EMN catheter at the completion of navigation. AFTRE has been used as a surrogate for successful navigation, and although data are not uniformly in agreement, several studies demonstrate an association between lower AFTRE and higher diagnostic yield [19,20].
