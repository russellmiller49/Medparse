Surgical resection is the treatment of choice for early-staged non-small cell lung cancer (Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)), but it's not perfect. On the one hand, it is difficult to localize small lung tumors intra-operatively. On the other hand, some patients present with multi-focal lesions that cannot be completely eradicated by surgery. Conventional treatment strategies to handle such conditions include surgical resection under localization with a hook-wire system or dye injection, whether by a percutaneous route or navigator bronchoscopy (4-6). However, there are several disadvantages of these treatment approaches, including the risk of general anesthesia, potential complications of bleeding or air leakage, especially for some patients with poor lung function or suboptimal medical conditions."

Photofrin, the most frequently used and commercially available photosensitizer for lung cancer, works under 630-nm red-light irradiation. Interstitial PDT aided by CT-guided catheter implantation has been adopted for peripheral lung cancer (10). Nevertheless, there are potential disadvantages of such an approach, such as the risk of hemopneumothorax during CT-guided catheter insertion, lung collapse causing dislodging of the catheter during the procedure, and an inability to target other lesions after lung collapse (10). Recently, electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) (SuperDimensionâ„¢ Navigation System, Super-D ENB, Covidien, Minneapolis, MN, USA) has been applied in the diagnosis, staging, preoperative localization and treatment of lung cancer (4,5,12-14). Compared with a percutaneous route, ENB has the advantages of reduced risk of pneumothorax and precise localization of lung tumor with a working channel through which the PDT irradiation probe can function. In addition, the initial use of hybrid operating room (OR) for ENB makes it a stronger tool (15). Our aim is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of tumor ablation via the newly developed 7th edition of the ENB system. In this clinical study, we evaluate whether ENB with SuperDimension (Super-D) combined with interstitial PDT may be useful in tumor control."

Using a locatable electromagnetic guide and an extended working catheter, each nodule was localized with the electromagnetic guide and the navigational console. After the nodule was located, the electromagnetic guide was removed, and the extended working catheter was left in place ( Figure 1 ).

However, some doubts about the significance of invasive procedures for very early lung cancer have been noted (16). With the aid of ENB, the PDT probe can reach the lung periphery where the tumor is located. This novel technique utilizes the virtual image generated to guide the surgeon through a  route  of  predetermined points within the bronchial tree, allowing improved access to peripheral lung lesions which conventional methods are incapable of reaching. Using ENB-guided sampling methods, the sensitivity for  the  detection  of  malignancy  with  bronchoscopic biopsy, brushing or fine-needle aspiration (FNA) has been estimated to be about 83% (4,5,12-14). One recent animal experiment reported that ENB-guided PDT was successful in dogs (17). We performed a pioneering study of three patients who underwent localization of pulmonary nodules via Super-D ENB guidance followed by PDT irradiation of the lung tumor in a hybrid OR. The aid of hybrid OR can confirm the localization by 2D or 3D image, which makes the navigation even more accurate (15). Our initial experience was successful and there were no adverse events related to ENB-guided localization. Localization techniques for lung nodules are typically reserved for lesions that are small and deep-seated in the lung parenchyma, or lesions that are ground glass opacities (GGOs) (4,5,12-14). The outcome obtained by ENB in our study is in agreement with previous studies of the safety and efficacy of ENB-guided transbronchial localization, which used transbronchial marking with methylene blue before minimally invasive thoracoscopic or robotic resection to guide the surgeon. These previous studies  found  that  this  technique  could  be  readily mastered and with less than a year of experience using"

For reasons of largely shared ethnicity, with Chinese elements added to the basic Austromalaysian populations, as well as geographical contiguity, they can be usefully grouped together for studies of chronic disease prevalence and underlying risk factors. The fact of problems are shared in common, particularly regarding increasing cancer rates, underlines the necessity for a coordinated approach to research and development of control measures. To provide a knowledge base, the present review of available data for cancer registration, epidemiology and control was conducted. The most prevalent cancer site in males is the lung, followed by the liver, colon or the prostate in the majority of cases, while breast and cervical cancers predominate in most female populations. However, there are interesting differences among the racial groups, particularly regarding the stomach. General tendencies for increase in adenocarcinomas but decrease in squamous cell carcinomas and gastric cancer, point to change in environmental influence over time. Variation in risk factors depends to some extent on the level of economic development but overall the countries of the region face similar challenges in achieving effective cancer control. A major task is persuading the general populace of the efficacy of early detection and clinical treatment."

For reasons of largely shared ethnicity and culture, with various degress of mixed Chinese and Altaic elements, as well as geographical contiguity, they can be usefully grouped together for studies of chronic disease prevalence and particularly cancer. The fact of problems shared in common, with increasing disease rates, underlines the necessity for a coordinated approach to research and development of control measures. To provide a knowledge base, the present review of cancer registration and epidemiology data was conducted. The most frequent cancers in males of North-East Asia are in the lung, liver and stomach, with considerable geographical and temporal variation in their respective prevalences. However, colorectal cancer is also of increasing importance. In females the breast, together with the lung in China, the liver in Mongolia and the stomach in Korea and Japan, are most frequent. Variation in risk factors depends to a large extent on the local level of economic development but overall the countries of the region face similar challenges in achieving effective cancer control."

        "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT), a treatment for cancer, uses a photosensitizer and laser irradiation to produce reactive oxygen in cells. In Japan, the United States, and many other countries, PDT is a treatment option for stage 0 (TisN0M0) and stage I (T1N0M0) centrally located early stage lung cancer. PDT can preserve lung function, can be repeated, and can be combined with other therapeutic modalities such as chemotherapy. Recently, mono-l-aspartyl chlorine e6 (NPe6, Laserphyrin), a second-generation photosensitizer with lower photosensitivity than Photofrin (porfimer sodium), was approved by the Japanese government and a phase II clinical study using NPe6 with a new diode laser demonstrated an excellent antitumor effect and low skin photosensitivity. We expect PDT to be widely employed in many fields and the applications of PDT to be extended because of the decreasing cost of laser equipment and lower systemic photosensitivity induced by the photosensitizer. The purpose of this review is to introduce not only recent clinical trials of PDT for centrally located early lung cancer, but also new applications of PDT for cases of peripheral-type, early-stage lung cancers. We also discuss the applications of PDT for advanced lung cancer and combined therapy using PDT and other treatments for lung cancer."

        "abstract": "Pleural spread is difficult to treat in malignancies, especially in lung cancer and thymoma. Monotherapy with surgery fails to have a better survival benefit than palliative chemotherapy, the currently accepted treatment. Photodynamic therapy utilizes a photosensitizer to target the tumor site, and the tumor is exposed to light after performing a pleurectomy and tumor resection. However, the benefits of this procedure to lung cancer or thymoma patients are unknown. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with lung cancer or thymoma with pleural seeding who underwent pleural photodynamic therapy and surgery between 2005 and 2013. Eighteen patients enrolled in this study. The mean patient age was 52.9 &#xb1; 12.2 years. Lung cancer was the inciting cancer of pleural dissemination in 10 patients (55.6%), and thymoma in 8 (44.4%). There was no procedure-related mortality. Using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the 3-year survival rate and the 5-year survival rate were 68.9% and 57.4%, respectively. We compared the PDT lung cancer patients with those receiving chemotherapy or target therapy (n = 51) and found that the PDT group had better survival than non-PDT patients (mean survival time: 39.0 versus 17.6 months; P = .047). With proper patient selection, radical surgical resection combined with intrapleural photodynamic therapy for pleural spread in patients with non-small cell lung cancer or thymoma is feasible and may provide a survival benefit."

        "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has now achieved the status of a standard treatment modality for centrally located early-stage lung cancer. In the last decade, CT screening for lung cancer has attracted much attention for its ability to detect early peripheral lung cancer. Extremely recently, treatment using PDT has been introduced for the first time in patients with peripheral lung cancer, who did not meet the previous criteria for surgery. The procedure was carried out with local anesthesia with xylocain infiltrated into the chest wall, 48 h after Photofrin administration. Needles (19 gauge) containing an internal catheter were inserted percutaneously under CT guidance. The needles were then extracted and a diffuser fiber with a 2 cm long tip for light delivery was positioned in the tumor through the catheter. Of the nine patients enrolled in this trial, seven achieved partial remission (PR). No serious complications, except for two cases of pneumothorax, were noted. As an increasing number of patients consider quality of life after therapy, the indications for PDT are expected to expand. We conclude that PDT is a promising new technique for curative treatment of localized, peripheral lung cancer less than 1cm in size in patients who are unfit for surgery or radiotherapy."

        "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy is increasingly being utilized to treat thoracic malignancies. For patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer, photodynamic therapy is primarily employed as an endobronchial therapy to definitely treat endobronchial, roentgenographically occult, or synchronous primary carcinomas. As definitive monotherapy, photodynamic therapy is most effective in treating bronchoscopically visible lung cancers &#x2264;1 cm with no extracartilaginous invasion. For patients with advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer, photodynamic therapy can be used to palliate obstructing endobronchial lesions, as a component of definitive multi-modality therapy, or to increase operability or reduce the extent of operation required. A review of the available medical literature detailing all published studies utilizing photodynamic therapy to treat at least 10 patients with non-small cell lung cancer is performed, and treatment recommendations and summaries for photodynamic therapy applications are described."

        "abstract": "Despite advances in technology and treatment options, lung cancer remains a deadly disease. National screening programs are being instituted in an attempt to discover lung cancer in high-risk individuals at an earlier stage. Such screening programs invariably discover small peripheral nodules that previously would not have been clinically apparent; the management of such lesions can be challenging. Current diagnostic options such as percutaneous biopsy are effective; however, they are hindered by their risk of morbidity such as pneumothorax. Electromagnetic bronchoscopy (ENB) is an emerging technology that allows the practitioner the ability to both sample and treat small peripheral pulmonary lesions. In experienced centers, ENB provides high rates of diagnostic yield for small lesions and a complication rate significantly lower than that of more conventional diagnostic modalities. Although there are current barriers to its widespread utilization (cost, specialized imaging, technical training), these obstacles will handled similarly to any other emerging technology and will likely not be long-term impediments to its use."

Navigational error of the system and movement of the biopsy tool during its deployment adversely affect biopsy success. Furthermore, conventional methods to confirm navigational success such as fluoroscopy and radial endobronchial ultrasound become less useful for the biopsy of small lesions. A hybrid operating theatre can provide unparalleled real-time imaging through DynaCT scan to guide and confirm successful navigation and biopsy of difficult-to-reach or small lesions. We describe our technique for DynaCT image-guided electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopic biopsy of a small pulmonary nodule in the hybrid operating theatre. The advantages, disadvantages and special considerations in adopting this approach are discussed."

However, some doubts about the significance of invasive procedures for very early lung cancer have been noted (16). With the aid of ENB, the PDT probe can reach the lung periphery where the tumor is located. This novel technique utilizes the virtual image generated to guide the surgeon through a  route  of  predetermined points within the bronchial tree, allowing improved access to peripheral lung lesions which conventional methods are incapable of reaching. Using ENB-guided sampling methods, the sensitivity for  the  detection  of  malignancy  with  bronchoscopic biopsy, brushing or fine-needle aspiration (FNA) has been estimated to be about 83% (4,5,12-14). One recent animal experiment reported that ENB-guided PDT was successful in dogs (17). We performed a pioneering study of three patients who underwent localization of pulmonary nodules via Super-D ENB guidance followed by PDT irradiation of the lung tumor in a hybrid OR. The aid of hybrid OR can confirm the localization by 2D or 3D image, which makes the navigation even more accurate (15). Our initial experience was successful and there were no adverse events related to ENB-guided localization. Localization techniques for lung nodules are typically reserved for lesions that are small and deep-seated in the lung parenchyma, or lesions that are ground glass opacities (GGOs) (4,5,12-14). The outcome obtained by ENB in our study is in agreement with previous studies of the safety and efficacy of ENB-guided transbronchial localization, which used transbronchial marking with methylene blue before minimally invasive thoracoscopic or robotic resection to guide the surgeon.
