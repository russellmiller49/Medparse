    "abstract": "This narrative review aims to provide an overview of medical pleurodesis techniques, and their indications and potential adverse effects. Pleurodesis is a procedure performed with the aim of obliterating the pleural space. It has indications in the management of both malignant and benign pleural effusions and pneumothorax. Various nonsurgical techniques exist to perform pleurodesis. The scope of this work is to review the different nonsurgical techniques and their indications. This narrative review was performed checking scientific databases for medical literature, focusing especially on the data derived from randomised controlled trials. Pleurodesis is an effective method to manage pleural effusions and pneumothorax, and minimally invasive techniques are now frequently used with good results. Further research is needed to assess the efficacy of new treatments and the possibility of using different techniques in association",

Pleurodesis is a procedure performed with the aim of obliterating the pleural space. It has indications in the management of both malignant and benign pleural effusions and pneumothorax. Various nonsurgical techniques exist to perform pleurodesis. The scope of this work is to review the different nonsurgical techniques and their indications. This narrative review was performed checking scientific databases for medical literature, focusing especially on the data derived from randomised controlled trials. Pleurodesis is an effective method to manage pleural effusions and pneumothorax, and minimally invasive techniques are now frequently used with good results. Further research is needed to assess the efficacy of new treatments and the possibility of using different techniques in association."

Up to now, the ideal agent has not been identified. However, a variety of agents have been used over the centuries, including autologous blood, doxycycline, iodopovidone, OK 432 and silver nitrate [2]. According to the current literature, talc stands out as the safest and most effective pleurodesis agent [3]. Talc pleurodesis demonstrates an overall success rate ranging from 80% to 95%, depending on the dose, the number of administrations, the pathological entity being treated and the patient ' s condition [4 -6].

The primary goals of IPCs include symptom relief, evacuation of the pleural space and the promotion of spontaneous pleurodesis without the use of sclerosing agents (figure 2). One of the critical advantages of IPCs is the ability to perform the procedure in an outpatient setting [19]. Despite IPCs being comparable to chemical pleurodesis in alleviating dyspnoea, IPCs exhibit variable pleurodesis rates, ranging from 16% to 65%, depending on the underlying pleural disease [22, 23].",

Among the available management options, definitive pleurodesis techniques allow the patient not to have to keep permanent or long-term devices in place. However, IPCs alone or as part of a combination of techniques provide an increased likelihood of pleurodesis, and appear to be a safe and cost-effective strategy. Despite the knowledge gained from available studies, additional data are needed to comprehend the efficacy of these treatments in order to maximise patient morbidity reduction and symptom control while achieving the best therapeutic outcome."

Not only are health care expenditures related to malignant pleural effusion significant, but malignant pleural effusions also often result in significant patient discomfort and distress, largely at the end of life. Advances in management over the past several years have provided patients with greater autonomy as they are able to provide self-aid at home either alone or with family assistance. Additionally, practice changes have allowed for fewer interventions allowing patients to spend more time out of the clinic or inpatient wards."

In this prospective, randomized comparison of two well-established pleurodesis procedures, 36 patients with malignant pleural effusions, expanded lungs after drainage, and expected survival of &gt; 1 mo received either bleomycin instillation (60E) via a small-bore thoracostomy tube or thoracoscopic talc poudrage (5 g) under local anesthesia. Efficacy, safety, and cost could be evaluated for 32 treatments (17 bleomycin, 15 talc) in 31 patients. Recurrence rates of effusion with bleomycin and talc poudrage after 30 d were 41% and 13% (p = 0.12), respectively, those after 90 d were 59% and 13%, respectively (p = 0.01), and those after 180 d were 65% and 13% (p = 0.005), respectively. Neither procedure showed any major adverse effect, and both were equally well tolerated. Cost estimation favored thoracoscopic talc poudrage, both for the initial hospitalization and with regard to recurrences. In conclusion, thoracoscopic talc pleurodesis under local anesthesia is superior to bleomycin instillation for pleurodesis in cases of malignant pleural effusion."

Medical thoracoscopy has indications in the management of a variety of pleural diseases. It is most commonly performed as a diagnostic procedure but has therapeutic applications as well. Although it has its advantages, management strategies of certain pleural diseases should take place within a multidisciplinary environment including general pulmonologists, interventional pulmonologists, and thoracic surgeons."

This multi-institutional, prospective, randomized trial compares 2 established methods for controlling symptomatic unilateral MPEs. Patients with unilateral MPEs were randomized to either daily tunneled catheter drainage (TCD) or bedside talc pleurodesis (TP). This trial is patterned after a previous randomized trial that showed that bedside TP was equivalent to thoracoscopic TP (CALGB 9334). The primary end point of the current study was combined success: consistent/reliable drainage/pleurodesis, lung expansion, and 30-day survival. A secondary end point, survival with effusion control, was added retrospectively. This trial randomized 57 patients who were similar in terms of age (62 years), active chemotherapy (28%), and histologic diagnosis (lung, 63%; breast, 12%; other/unknown cancers, 25%) to either bedside TP or TCD. Combined success was higher with TCD (62%) than with TP (46%; odds ratio, 5.0; P = .064). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that patients treated with TCD had better 30-day activity without dyspnea scores (8.7 vs. 5.9; P = .036), especially in the subgroup with impaired expansion (9.1 vs. 4.6; P = .042). Patients who underwent TCD had better survival with effusion control at 30 days compared with those who underwent TP (82% vs. 52%, respectively; P = .024). In this prospective randomized trial, TCD achieved superior palliation of unilateral MPEs than TP, particularly in patients with trapped lungs."

        "abstract": "Persistent air leaks (PALs) are associated with prolonged hospital stays, contamination&#xa0;and sustained infection of the pleural space, and significant morbidity. A fistulous tract between the alveoli and the pleural space is referred to as an&#xa0;alveolar-pleural fistula (APF), whereas a fistulous tract between the bronchiole and the pleural space is referred to as a bronchopleural fistula (BPF). There is no consensus on the treatment, and multiple modalities exist for the management of persistent air leak (PAL). Autologous blood patch (ABP) is a relatively safe and inexpensive method that has been used for many years for the treatment of PALs. We conducted an electronic database search between 08/24/2022 and 08/27/2022 in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane using keywords. The following keywords were used: \"Blood patch\" OR \"Autologous blood patch\" AND \"pleurodesis.\"&#xa0;Our study included all original studies with the prime focus on the etiology of PALs, clinical characteristics, procedural details of ABP, and outcomes of the proposed treatment. The primary outcomes that were the focus of our study were the time to seal the air leak, the time to remove the chest tube after air leak cessation, and the time to discharge from the hospital. To determine the safety of ABP, we also evaluated the procedural outcomes. Our findings suggest a statistically significant decrease in the time to air leak cessation when compared to the control group (mean difference of -3.75 {95% CI: -5.65 to -1.85; P=0.001}) with considerable heterogeneity of I<sup>2</sup>=85% and P=0.001. However, the difference was not statistically significant when a lower dose of ABP (50 mL) was compared to a higher dose (100 mL) (mean difference of 1.48 {95% CI: -0.07 to 3.02; P=0.06}) and considerable heterogeneity of I<sup>2</sup>=80% and P=0.03. There was no statistically significant difference in the time to discharge when compared to the control group (mean difference of -2.12 {95% CI: -4.83 to 0.59; P=0.13}) and considerable heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup>=95% and P&lt;0.001). When compared to the control group, ABP did not provide any statistically significant difference in the risk ratio for infection (1.18 {95% CI: 0.52 to 2.65; P=0.70} and moderate heterogeneity {I<sup>2</sup>=33% and P=0.20}), pain (1.18 {95% CI: 0.52 to 2.65; P=0.70} and moderate heterogeneity {I<sup>2</sup>=33% and P=0.20}), and fever (0.54 {95% CI: 0.27 to 1.10; P=0.09} and no heterogeneity {I<sup>2</sup>=0% and P=0.50}). Our study concludes that using ABP caused a statistically significant decrease in the time to air leak cessation when compared to the control group. However, the procedure does not provide a statistically significant difference in the time to discharge from the hospital when compared to conservative treatment. Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference in the risk ratio for complications such as infection, pain, and fever when compared to conservative management. More studies need to be conducted to fully understand the efficacy and safety of ABP in the management of PALs."

        "abstract": "Persistent air leaks (PALs) are associated with prolonged hospital stays, contamination&#xa0;and sustained infection of the pleural space, and significant morbidity. A fistulous tract between the alveoli and the pleural space is referred to as an&#xa0;alveolar-pleural fistula (APF), whereas a fistulous tract between the bronchiole and the pleural space is referred to as a bronchopleural fistula (BPF). There is no consensus on the treatment, and multiple modalities exist for the management of persistent air leak (PAL). Autologous blood patch (ABP) is a relatively safe and inexpensive method that has been used for many years for the treatment of PALs. We conducted an electronic database search between 08/24/2022 and 08/27/2022 in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane using keywords. The following keywords were used: \"Blood patch\" OR \"Autologous blood patch\" AND \"pleurodesis.\"&#xa0;Our study included all original studies with the prime focus on the etiology of PALs, clinical characteristics, procedural details of ABP, and outcomes of the proposed treatment. The primary outcomes that were the focus of our study were the time to seal the air leak, the time to remove the chest tube after air leak cessation, and the time to discharge from the hospital. To determine the safety of ABP, we also evaluated the procedural outcomes. Our findings suggest a statistically significant decrease in the time to air leak cessation when compared to the control group (mean difference of -3.75 {95% CI: -5.65 to -1.85; P=0.001}) with considerable heterogeneity of I<sup>2</sup>=85% and P=0.001. However, the difference was not statistically significant when a lower dose of ABP (50 mL) was compared to a higher dose (100 mL) (mean difference of 1.48 {95% CI: -0.07 to 3.02; P=0.06}) and considerable heterogeneity of I<sup>2</sup>=80% and P=0.03. There was no statistically significant difference in the time to discharge when compared to the control group (mean difference of -2.12 {95% CI: -4.83 to 0.59; P=0.13}) and considerable heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup>=95% and P&lt;0.001). When compared to the control group, ABP did not provide any statistically significant difference in the risk ratio for infection (1.18 {95% CI: 0.52 to 2.65; P=0.70} and moderate heterogeneity {I<sup>2</sup>=33% and P=0.20}), pain (1.18 {95% CI: 0.52 to 2.65; P=0.70} and moderate heterogeneity {I<sup>2</sup>=33% and P=0.20}), and fever (0.54 {95% CI: 0.27 to 1.10; P=0.09} and no heterogeneity {I<sup>2</sup>=0% and P=0.50}). Our study concludes that using ABP caused a statistically significant decrease in the time to air leak cessation when compared to the control group. However, the procedure does not provide a statistically significant difference in the time to discharge from the hospital when compared to conservative treatment. Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference in the risk ratio for complications such as infection, pain, and fever when compared to conservative management. More studies need to be conducted to fully understand the efficacy and safety of ABP in the management of PALs."

        "abstract": "<b>Background and Objective:</b> Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) often results in debilitating symptoms. Relief of dyspnoea and improvement in quality of life can be achieved with either talc pleurodesis or insertion of an indwelling tunneled pleural catheter (IPC). The former requires a lengthy hospital stay and the latter is associated with lower pleurodesis rates. In response to limited hospital bed capacity, we developed a pragmatic approach in managing MPE by combining thoracoscopic talc poudrage and insertion of IPC into a single day case procedure. We present data on the safety and efficacy of this approach. <b>Methods:</b> Patients who had undergone the abovementioned procedure between 2017 and 2020 were analyzed. Demographic data, hospital length of stay (LOS), histological diagnosis, rates of pleurodesis success and procedural related complications were collated. Patients were followed-up for 6 months. <b>Results:</b> Forty-five patients underwent the procedure. Mean age was 68.5 &#xb1; 10.4 years and 56% were male. Histological diagnosis was achieved in all cases. 86.7% of patients were discharged on the day of the procedure. Median LOS was 0 (IQR 0-0) days. Successful pleurodesis was attained in 77.8% at 6-month follow-up. No procedure related deaths or IPC related infections were recorded. <b>Conclusion:</b> Ambulatory thoracoscopic poudrage and IPC insertion is a safe and effective option in the management of MPE. All patients received a definitive pleural intervention with 77.8% pleurodesis success at 6-months and majority of them discharged on the same day. Future randomized trials are required to confirm these findings."

MPE causes disabling breathlessness and indicates advanced disease with a poor prognosis. Treatment approaches focus on symptom relief and optimising quality of life (QoL). Patients who newly present with MPE commonly require procedural intervention for both diagnosis and therapeutic benefit.Thoracoscopic pleural biopsies are highly sensitive in diagnosing pleural malignancy. Talc poudrage may be delivered at thoracoscopy (TTP) to prevent effusion recurrence by effecting pleurodesis. Indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) offer an alternative strategy for fluid control, enabling outpatient management and are often used as 'rescue' therapy following pleurodesis failure or in cases of 'trapped lung'. It is unknown whether combining a TTP with IPC insertion will improve patient symptoms or reduce time spent in the hospital.The randomised thoracoscopic talc poudrage + indwelling pleural catheters versus thoracoscopic talc poudrage only in malignant pleural effusion trial (TACTIC) is the first randomised controlled trial (RCT) to examine the benefit of a combined TTP and IPC procedure, evaluating cost-effectiveness and patient-centred outcomes such as symptoms and QoL. The study remains in active recruitment and has the potential to radically transform the pathway for all patients presenting with MPE."

To date, management has been palliative in nature with a focus on draining the pleural space, with therapies aimed at preventing recurrence or providing intermittent drainage through indwelling catheters. Given that patients with MPEs are heterogeneous with respect to their cancer type and response to systemic therapy, functional status, and pleural milieu, response to MPE therapy is also heterogeneous and difficult to predict. Furthermore, the impact of therapies on important patient outcomes has only recently been evaluated consistently in clinical trials and cohort studies. In this review, we examine patient outcomes that have been studied to date, address the question of which are most important for managing patients, and review the literature related to the expected value for money (cost-effectiveness) of indwelling pleural catheters relative to traditionally recommended approaches."

Indwelling pleural catheters (IPC) allow ambulatory drainage and reduce hospital days and re-intervention rates when compared to standard talc slurry pleurodesis. Daily drainage accelerates pleurodesis, and talc instillation via the IPC has been proven feasible and safe. Surgical pleurodesis via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is considered a one-off intervention for MPE and is often recommended to patients who are fit for surgery. The AMPLE-3 trial is the first randomised trial to compare IPC (&#xb1;talc pleurodesis) and VATS pleurodesis in those who are fit for surgery."

Pleural effusions are very common in a number of non-malignant pathologies, such as decompensated heart failure, and following coronary artery bypass grafting. Pleural fluid analysis forms an important basis of the diagnostic evaluation, and more specific assays and imaging modalities are helpful in specific subpopulations.Options for management beyond treatment of the underlying disorder, whenever possible, include therapeutically aspirating the fluid, talc pleurodesis and insertion of an indwelling pleural catheter. Randomised trials will inform clinicians in the future as to the risks and benefits of these options providing a guide as to how best to manage patient symptoms in this challenging clinical setting."

The optimal management strategy is controversial and includes both invasive and non-invasive strategies. Practitioners have the option of invasive procedures such as intermittent drainage or more permanent catheter drainage to confirm malignancy and to palliate symptoms. Because these effusions are often detected late in the course of disease in patients who may have limited life expectancy, procedural management may be associated with harms that outweigh benefits. We performed a literature review to examine the available evidence for catheter drainage of malignant pleural effusions in advanced cancer and reviewed alternative management strategies for the management of dyspnea. We provide a clinical case within the context of the research evidence for invasive and non-invasive management strategies. Our intent is to help inform decision making of patients and families in collaboration with their health care practitioners and interventionists by weighing the risks and benefits of catheter drainage versus alternative medical management strategies for malignant pleural effusions."

All IPC insertions for non-malignant cases from five large UK centres were found using prospectively maintained databases. Data were collected on 57 IPC insertions. The commonest indications were hepatic hydrothorax (33%) and inflammatory pleuritis (26%). The mean weekly fluid output was 2.8 L (SD 2.52). 48/57 (84%) patients had no complications. Suspected pleural infection was documented in 2 (3.5%) cases. 33% (19/57) of patients underwent 'spontaneous' pleurodesis at a median time of 71 days. Patients with hepatic disease achieved pleurodesis significantly less often than those with non-hepatic disease (p=0.03). These data support the use of IPCs in select cases of non-malignant disease when maximal medical therapy has failed."

Recent advances in treatment have been variably implemented in clinical practice. This statement reviews the latest developments and concepts to improve clinical management and stimulate further research.The European Respiratory Society's Scientific Committee established a multidisciplinary team of pulmonologists and surgeons to produce a comprehensive review of available scientific evidence.Smoking remains the main risk factor of PSP. Routine smoking cessation is advised. More prospective data are required to better define the PSP population and incidence of recurrence. In first episodes of PSP, treatment approach is driven by symptoms rather than PSP size. The role of bullae rupture as the cause of air leakage remains unclear, implying that any treatment of PSP recurrence includes pleurodesis. Talc poudrage pleurodesis by thoracoscopy is safe, provided calibrated talc is available. Video-assisted thoracic surgery is preferred to thoracotomy as a surgical approach.In first episodes of PSP, aspiration is required only in symptomatic patients. After a persistent or recurrent PSP, definitive treatment including pleurodesis is undertaken. Future randomised controlled trials comparing different strategies are required."

        "abstract": "Spontaneous pneumothorax remains a significant health problem. However, with time, there have been improvements in pathogenesis, diagnostic procedures and both medical and surgical approaches to treatment. Owing to better imaging techniques, it is now clear that there is almost no normal visceral pleura in the case of spontaneous pneumothorax, and that blebs and bullae are not always the cause of pneumothorax. In first episodes of primary spontaneous pneumothorax, observation and simple aspiration are established first-line therapies, as proven by randomised controlled trials. Aspiration should be better promoted in daily medical practice. In the case of recurrent or persistent pneumothorax, simple talc poudrage under thoracoscopy has been shown to be safe, cost-effective and no more painful than a conservative treatment using a chest tube. There are also new experimental data showing that talc poudrage, as used in Europe, does not lead to serious side-effects and is currently the best available pleural sclerosing agent. Alternatively, surgical techniques have considerably improved, and are now less invasive, especially due to the development of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Studies suggest that video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery may be more cost-effective than chest tube drainage in spontaneous pneumothorax requiring chest tube drainage, although it is more expensive than simple thoracoscopy and requires general anaesthesia, double-lumen tube intubation and ventilation. Recommendations are made regarding the treatment of pneumothorax. In secondary or complicated primary pneumothorax, i.e. recurrent or persistent pneumothorax, some diffuse treatment of the visceral pleura should be offered, either by talc poudrage under thoracoscopy or by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Moreover, all of these new techniques should be better standardised to permit comparison in randomised controlled studies."

        "abstract": "Simple thoracoscopic talcage (TT) is a safe and effective treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP). However, its efficacy has not previously been estimated in comparison with standard conservative therapy (pleural drainage (PD)). In this prospective randomised comparison of two well-established procedures of treating PSP requiring at least a chest tube, cost-effectiveness, safety and pain control was evaluated in 108 patients with PSP (61 TT and 47 PD). Patients in both groups had comparable clinical characteristics. Drainage and hospitalisation duration were similar in TT and PD patients. There were no complications in either group. The immediate success rate was different: after prolonged drainage (&gt;7 days), 10 out of 47 PD patients, but only 1 out of 61 TT patients required a TT as a second procedure. Total costs of hospitalisation including any treatment procedure were not significantly different between TT and PD patients. Pain, measured daily by visual analogue scales, was statistically higher during the first 3 days in TT patients but not in those patients receiving opiates. One month after leaving hospital, there was no significant difference in residual pain or full working ability: 20 out of 58 (34%) versus 10 out of 47 (21%) and 36 out of 61 (59%) versus 26 out of 39 (67%) in TT versus PD groups, respectively. After 5 yrs of follow-up, there had been only three out of 59 (5%) recurrences of pneumothorax after TT, but 16 out of 47 (34%) after conservative treatment by PD. Cost calculation favoured TT pleurodesis especially with regard to recurrences. In conclusion, thoracoscopic talc pleurodesis under local anaesthesia is superior to conservative treatment by chest tube drainage in cases of primary spontaneous pneumothorax that fail simple aspiration, provided there is efficient control of pain by opioids."

Although the optimal surgical technique is uncertain, bullous resection using staplers in combination with mechanical pleurodesis, chemical pleurodesis and/or staple line coverage is usually undertaken. Currently, patient satisfaction, postoperative pain and other perioperative parameters have significantly improved with advancements in thoracoscopic technology, which include uniportal, needlescopic and nonintubated VATS variants. Ipsilateral recurrences after VATS occur in less than 5% of patients, in which case a redo-VATS is a feasible therapeutical option. Randomized controlled trials are urgently needed to shed light on the best definitive management of SP."

IPC use is safe compared to talc pleurodesis, though complications can occur. Pleural infection affects &lt;5% of patients, and is usually responsive to antibiotic treatment without requiring catheter removal or surgery. Pleural loculations develop over time, limiting drainage in 10% of patients, which can be improved with intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy. Catheter tract metastasis can occur with most tumours but is more common in mesothelioma. The metastases usually respond to analgaesics and/or external radiotherapy. Long-term intermittent drainage of exudative effusions or chylothorax can potentially lead to loss of nutrients, though no data exist on any clinical impact. Fibrin clots within the catheter lumen can result in blockage. Chest pain following IPC insertion is often mild, and adjustments in analgaesics and drainage practice are usually all that are required. As clinical experience with the use of IPC accumulates, the profile and natural course of complications are increasingly described. We aim to summarise the available literature on IPC-related complications and the evidence to support specific strategies."

        "abstract": "Multiple randomized clinical trials have established the advantages of indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) in the management of malignant pleural effusions, resulting in its widespread adoption in clinical practice. Complications can occur with IPC use and must be recognized and managed effectively. This review provides a comprehensive overview of IPC complications and their best care. Pain postinsertion or during drainage of IPC is easily manageable and must be distinguished from tumor-related chest wall pain. IPC-related infections require systemic antibiotics and often intrapleural fibrinolytic/deoxyribonuclease therapy. The removal of IPC for infection is usually unnecessary. Symptomatic loculation usually responds to fibrinolytics but may recur. Catheter tract metastases are common in mesothelioma patients and usually respond to radiotherapy without inducing damages to the IPC. Less common complications include dislodgement, irreversible blockage, and fractures (upon removal) of the catheter. Recommendations on the management of IPC complications by recent consensus statement/guideline are discussed. Expert opinions on management approaches are included in areas where evidence is lacking to guide care."

        "abstract": "The approach to management of malignant pleural effusions (MPE) has changed over the past few decades. The key goals of MPE management are to relieve patient symptoms using the least invasive means and in the most cost-effective manner. There is now a realization that patient-reported outcome measures should be the primary goal of MPE treatment, and this now is the focus in most clinical trials. Efforts to minimize patient morbidity are complemented by development of less invasive treatments that have mostly replaced the more aggressive surgical approaches of the past. Therapeutic thoracentesis is simple, effective and generally safe, although its benefits may only be temporary. Pleurodesis is the conventional and for a long time the only definitive therapy available. However, the efficacy and safety of talc pleurodesis has been challenged. Indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) drainage is increasingly accepted worldwide and represents a new concept to improve symptoms without necessarily generating pleural symphysis. Recent studies support the effectiveness of IPC treatment and provide reassurance regarding its safety. An unprecedented number of clinical trials are now underway to improve various aspects of MPE care. However, choosing an optimal intervention for MPE in an individual patient remains a challenge due to our limited understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of breathlessness in MPE and a lack of predictors of survival and pleurodesis outcome. This review provides an overview of common pleural interventional procedures used for MPE management, controversies and limitations of current practice, and areas of research most needed to improve practice in future."

Furthermore, pleurodesis failure was significantly higher in the IPC arm than in the chest drain arm (69% versus 26.5% at 90 days, respectively). However, the authors acknowledged some limitations of this result. First, pleurodesis was defined as a failure in all patients in whom the IPC remained in situ , including those who chose not to have their IPCs removed despite successful pleurodesis. Additionally, patients in the IPC arm had larger effusions and many were under systemic therapy [45].",

Among these, pleural infection incidence varies from 4.9% to 12% [53, 73, 76]. Generally, when the infection is promptly recognised, it can be effectively managed with antibiotics and removal of the IPC is typically unnecessary [53, 73, 76, 77]. A comprehensive, real-life study involving >1000 patients with MPE treated with IPCs has been published [77]. Overall, nearly 5% of the patients developed an IPC-related pleural infection and 95% of them were successfully treated solely with antibiotic therapy. Notably, 74% of the infected patients were hospitalised, with 62% receiving at least one dose of intravenous antibiotic therapy. However, no difference in the healing success rate was observed between those treated with only oral therapy and those receiving intravenous antibiotics [77].",
