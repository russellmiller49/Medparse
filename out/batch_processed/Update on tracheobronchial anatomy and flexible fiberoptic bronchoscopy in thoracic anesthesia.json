With Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or aging, the lateral diameter of the trachea may decrease with an increase in the anteroposterior diameter. Conversely, Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may also lead to softening of the tracheal rings with a decrease in the anteroposterior diameter of the trachea [6 /C15/C15 ].

            "text": "The trachea bifurcates at the carina into the right and left mainstem bronchus. An important fact is that the tracheal lumen narrows slightly as it progresses towards the carina. The tracheal bifurcation is located at the level of the sternal angle anteriorly and the 5th thoracic vertebra posteriorly. The right mainstem bronchus lies in a more vertical orientation relative to the trachea, whereas the left mainstem bronchus lies in a more horizontal plane. The right mainstem bronchus continues as the bronchus intermedius after the take-off of the right upper lobe bronchus. In men, the average distance from the tracheal carina to the take-off of the right upper lobe bronchus is an average of 2.0 cm, whereas it is approximately 1.5 cm in women. One in every 250 individuals from the general population may have an abnormal take-off of the right upper lobe bronchus emerging from above the tracheal carina on the right side. The diameter of the right mainstem bronchus is an average of 17.5 mm in men and 14 mm in women. The trifurcation of the right upper lobe bronchus consists of the apical, anterior and posterior division. This is a very important landmark to identify while performing fiberoptic bronchoscopy in order to distinguish the right from the left mainstem bronchus. The distance from the tracheal carina to the bifurcation of the left upper and left lower lobe is approximately 5.0 cm in men and 4.5 cm in women. The left mainstem bronchus is longer than the right mainstem bronchus, and it divides into the left upper and the left lower lobe bronchus. The left upper lobe bronchus has a superior and inferior division. Figure 1 displays the anatomical distances of the airway. Figures 2, 3 and 4 correspond to a multidetector three-dimensional computer tomography scan of the chest [7 /C15 ] displaying the trachea and bronchial anatomy in a 25-year-old healthy volunteer (Fig. 2), in a 60-year-old healthy woman (Fig. 3), and in a 60-year-old man with severe Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Fig. 4), which shows a deviated trachea and narrow bronchus.",

As the scope is advanced inside the take-off of the right upper bronchus, a clear view of the orifices is found: apical, anterior and posterior segments. This is the only structure in the tracheobronchial tree that has three orifices. After withdrawing the bronchoscope from the right upper bronchus, it is advanced distally into the bronchus intermedius in order to identify the middle and lower right lobe bronchi. The right middle bronchus has the shape of a letter D. Once the complete examination has been performed on the right mainstem bronchus, the bronchoscope is withdrawn until the tracheal carina is seen again. Then the bronchoscope is readvanced into the left mainstem bronchus in which the bifurcation into left upper and lower lobe is visualized. The anatomical distance from tracheal carina to the bifurcation on the left-sided bronchus is approximately 4-5cm in length.

Figure 8 shows the proper position of an Arndt wire-guided endobronchial blocker (William Cook Europe A/S, Bjaeverskor, Denmark). The optimal position is achieved with the use of a fiberscope. The proximal surface of the fully inflated balloon should be positioned at least 5-10 mm below the tracheal carina in the corresponding mainstem bronchus. While placing a right-sided bronchial blocker, if the distance between the tracheal carina and the take-off of the right upper lobe bronchus is too short (i.e. less than 1.0 cm), a proper adjustment with the fully inflated balloon needs to be made, making sure that the proximal surface of the balloon is located below the entrance of the right mainstem bronchus.

Given the availability of two technologies--DLTs (right-sided and left-sided) and bronchial blocker technology (TCBU, Arndt, and Cohen--every case that requires lung collapse and OLV should receive the benefit of these devices. Because of its greater margin of safety, a left-sided DLT is the more common device used in lung separation. If any contraindication to placing a left-sided DLT exists, a right-sided DLT is an option for any specific situation (eg, left lung transplantation). For a patient who requires lung separation and presents with the dilemma of a difficult or abnormal airway, bronchial blockers offer more advantages. Regardless of the device used, the optimal position of these devices (DLTs and bronchial blockers) is achieved best with the use of fiberoptic bronchoscopy techniques first in supine and then in lateral decubitus position or whenever repositioning of the device is needed."

        "abstract": "High frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) is a well accepted method for securing ventilation in rigid and interventional bronchoscopy. We describe a technique of HFJV using a 14F nylon insufflation catheter placed in the trachea to support stent implantation or endobronchial balloon dilation in endobronchial stenoses with the flexible fiberscope. One hundred sixty-one cases were treated with either a metal wire stent (n = 105) or with balloon dilation (n = 56). In addition to HFJV, IV anesthesia was applied in 132 cases. Driving pressure was 1125-1275 mm Hg, frequency 80-100/min, and inspiratory:expiratory ratio of 1:2. Fraction of inspired oxygen ranged from 0.3-1.0. The effects on alveolar ventilation were assessed by using blood-gas analysis and continuous monitoring of transcutaneous oxygen and carbon dioxide tension (P(tc)CO(2)). Complications consisted of hypertension (n = 8), hypotension (n = 6), bronchospasm (n = 5), and hypoxia (n = 6). In 52% of the cases, mild hypercarbia (P(tc)CO2 50-60mm Hg) was observed. In two cases, a P(tc)CO(2) &gt; 80 mm Hg resolved spontaneously when the patients returned to normal breathing after intermittent superimposed ventilation with a face mask. During placement of stents in the proximal trachea, the jet catheter had to be withdrawn, resulting in displacement of the catheter into the pharynx in one case, which was managed safely with the bronchoscope. In conclusion, HFJV achieves satisfactory operating conditions and provides adequate gas exchange for interventional bronchoscopic procedures with the fiberscope."

This review examines the indications for MDCT, the different types of scan, the use of low-dose protocols for paediatric imaging and appropriate reconstruction techniques. Patient preparation, with particular respect to sedation and optimal contrast bolus delivery, is also addressed."

        "abstract": "Lung isolation can be accomplished in two ways: the first, a double-lumen endotracheal tube (DLT) and the second, a bronchial blocker (Univent or Arndt blocker). Previous studies have found that the DLT and the Univent are comparable when providing lung isolation. A new bronchial blocker, the wire-guided endobronchial blocker (Arndt blocker), has been introduced. However, there is no study to report its effectiveness with lung isolation during elective thoracic surgical cases. Therefore, we designed a prospective, randomized trial to compare the effectiveness of lung isolation among the 3 endotracheal tubes: the left-sided DLT Broncho-Cath Group A (n = 16 patients), the torque control blocker Univent Group B (n = 16 patients), and the wire-guided Arndt blocker Group C (n = 32 patients). The following variables were recorded: 1) time to initially position the assigned tube, 2) frequency of malpositions, 3) frequency of use of fiberoptic bronchoscope, 4) overall surgical exposure, and 5) tube acquisition cost. The Arndt blocker took longer to place (3:34 min/s) compared with the other 2 groups: the DLT group (2:08 min/s) or the Univent group (2:38 min/s) (P &lt; 0.0004). There was no statistical difference in tube malpositions among the three groups: two for the DLT group, four for the Univent group, and nine in the Arndt group. Excluding the time for tube placement, the Arndt group also took longer for the lung to collapse (26:02 min/s), compared with the DLT group (17:54 min/s) or Univent group (19:28 min/s) (P &lt; 0.0060). Furthermore, unlike the other two groups, the majority of the Arndt patients required suction to achieve lung collapse. Once lung isolation was achieved, overall surgical exposure was rated excellent for the three groups. Acquisition cost for the DLT group was $1663.20 (21 tubes opened), $2329.00 for the Univent group (17 tubes opened), and $3567.00 for the Arndt group (33 wire-guided blockers opened). This study demonstrates that the Arndt blocker takes longer to position and longer to deflate the isolated lung. For elective thoracic surgical cases, once the lung was isolated, the management seemed to be similar for all three tube groups."

The second involves blockade of a mainstem bronchus (bronchial blockers). Bronchial blockade technology is on the rise, and in some specific clinical situations (e.g., management of the difficult airway during OLV or selective lobar blockade) it can offer more as an alternative to achieve OLV in adults. Special emphasis on newer information for the use of Fogarty embolectomy catheter as a bronchial blocker, the torque control blocker Univent, and the wire-guided endobronchial blocker (Arndt blocker) is included. Also this review describes placement, positioning, complications, ventilation modalities, and airflow resistances of all three bronchial blockers. Finally, the bronchial blockers can be used in many cases that require OLV, taking into consideration that bronchial blockers require longer time for placement, assisted suction to expedite lung collapse, and the use of fiberoptic bronchoscopy. The current use of bronchial blockers, supported by scientific evidence, dictates that bronchial blockers should be available in any service that performs lung separation techniques."
