    "abstract": "Rationale: Despite advancements in emphysema treatment, high morbidity and mortality rates highlight the need for innovative therapies. A novel self-expanding nitinol airway scaffold was designed to alleviate lung hyperinflation by connecting emphysematous parenchyma with central bronchi, releasing trapped air. Objectives: To assess the feasibility, safety, and initial outcomes of airway scaffolds in treating emphysema-related hyperinflation. Methods: We conducted a pooled analysis of two first-in-human studies (NCT05949645, NCT05854550) involving patients with heterogeneous or homogeneous emphysema treated bronchoscopically with up to three permanent airway scaffolds per lung. Measurements and Main Results: The primary outcome was safety, measured by procedure- and/or device-related serious adverse events over 6 months. Secondary outcomes were technical feasibility, pulmonary function, quality of life, symptoms, exercise capacity at 3 and 6 months, and airway patency assessment by high-resolution computed tomography. Sixty severe emphysema patients (33 female, 27 male; mean age, 66 6 8 yr; mean residual volume percent predicted, 255 6 47%) were included. Ninety-eight procedures were performed, and 328 airway scaffolds were successfully placed. A proportion of 21.7% of patients experienced at least one related serious adverse event within 6 months, including pneumonia (10.0%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation (5.0%), but no pneumothoraxes occurred. Residual volume improved (decreased) from baseline by a mean [95% con /uniFB01 dence interval] of 866 [626, 1,106] ml at 3 months and 753 [512, 994] ml at 6 months. Clinically meaningful improvements were further observed in spirometry, quality of life, symptoms, and exercise capacity. Conclusions: This study provides the first clinical evidence of the feasibility, safety, and initial outcomes after treatment with airway scaffolds in patients with emphysema-related hyperinflation. The BREATHE study (Study to Assess Safety, Feasibility, and Preliminary Ef /uniFB01 cacy of the Apreo Implant for Severe Emphysema) comprised two prospective, multicenter, single-arm clinical trials: BREATHE-1 (NCT05854550) in Australia and BREATHE-2 (NCT05949645) in Europe. Both studies followed very similar protocols with minor differences in study procedures and eligibility criteria. Procedures differed with BREATHE-1 patients undergoing one fewer computed tomographic (CT) scan and BREATHE-2 patients undergoing one fewer bronchoscopy during the follow-up interval. Eligibility differed with respect to inclusion criteria (baseline FEV1, 20 -50% predicted for patients enrolled in BREATHE-1 vs. 15 -50% predicted for those enrolled in BREATHE-2) and exclusion criteria (three or more acute exacerbations of Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in the prior year, history of excessive dynamic collapse of the trachea or main bronchi, and coronary artery disease with angina were exclusionary for BREATHE-1 patients). BREATHE-1 also complied with Australian regulations, whereas BREATHE-2 followed European Union Medical Device Reporting and U.K. Medical Device Reporting requirements. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, approved by local ethics committees",

Removal of six airway scaffolds in four patients (6.7%) was attempted via bronchoscopy, occurring 51 6 13 days (range, 37 -65 d) after implantation. Reasons for removal were airway kinking with accompanying dyspnea, lack of patency, and pneumonia as an SAE. Removal of /uniFB01 ve of six airway scaffolds was successful and not associated with tissue injury or other complications. One removal attempt was unsuccessful because the distal end of the device could not be freed with traction via forceps. Because the situs of the proximal portion of the airway scaffold was altered in the removal attempt, the investigator elected to sever this proximal portion, resulting in the removal of an approximately one-fourth length of the airway scaffold; the remaining portion of the airway scaffold was positioned well within the airway. The patient did experience an SAE (respiratory tract infection) associated with the partial removal of the airway scaffold, which resolved without sequelae 18 days after scaffold removal. No clinically signi /uniFB01 cant /uniFB01 ndings were noted upon bronchoscopic evaluation approximately 3 months after the airway scaffold removal (6-month follow-up visit), and the remainder of the airway scaffold was still positioned in the airway."

Second, the airway scaffolds are designed to have minimal tissue contact density (de /uniFB01 ned as surface area of scaffold -tissue contact relative to the total area of the supported airway) such that any tissue reaction to the scaffold is likely limited only to the region of direct scaffold -tissue contact as opposed to the EASE trial stents, which had a relatively high tissue contact density and tissue reaction along its entire length.

Topographic multiplanar rendering displays the airways and associated parenchyma on the same plane (28). Distribution of treated airway diameters preimplant and at 6-month follow-up visit measured in the proximal and distal regions of the airway scaffold by quantitative computed tomographic analysis. Preimplant airway diameters, particularly at the distal regions of the implant, were frequently NM, likely because of collapse. At 6 months after initial implant procedure, most airway diameters could be measured, and diameters were larger than preimplant. NM = not measurable."

The NETT was not a crossover trial and therefore was able to examine the effects of optimal medical management and LVRS on short- and long-term survival,as well as lung function, exercise performance, and quality of life.The NETT generated multiple insights into the preoperative, perioperative,and postoperative management of patients undergoing thoracotomy; described pain control techniques that were safe and effective; and emphasized the need to address nonpulmonary issues to optimize surgical outcomes. After the NETT, newer investigation has focused on bronchoscopic endobronchial interventions and other techniques less invasive than LVRS to achieve lung reduction.In this review, we summarize what we currently know about the role of LVRS in the treatment of severe emphysema as a result of insights gained from the NETT and provide a brief review of the newer techniques of lung volume reduction."

We analyzed the power of lung hyperinflation as measured by the inspiratory capacity-to-total lung capacity ratio (IC/TLC) to predict mortality in a cohort of 689 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (95% males; FEV(1), 1.17 L) with a mean follow-up of 34 months. We also compared the predictive value of IC/TLC with that of the BODE (body mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnea, exercise performance) Index. Subjects who died (183; 27%) were older; had lower body mass index, FEV(1), and IC/TLC ratio; walked less in the 6-minute walking distance; and had more dyspnea, a higher BODE Index, and comorbidity (p &lt; 0.001). On the basis of logistic regression analysis, IC/TLC was found to be a good and independent predictor of all-cause and respiratory mortality. On the basis of receiver operating characteristic Type II curves, IC/TLC compared favorably with FEV(1) and predicted mortality independently of the BODE Index. We conclude that IC/TLC is an independent risk factor for mortality in subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We propose that this ratio be considered in the assessment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."

It is widely used in the assessment of lung function to provide objective information used in the diagnosis of lung diseases and monitoring lung health. In 2005, the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society jointly adopted technical standards for conducting spirometry. Improvements in instrumentation and computational capabilities, together with new research studies and enhanced quality assurance approaches, have led to the need to update the 2005 technical standards for spirometry to take full advantage of current technical capabilities.<b>Methods:</b> This spirometry technical standards document was developed by an international joint task force, appointed by the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society, with expertise in conducting and analyzing pulmonary function tests, laboratory quality assurance, and developing international standards. A comprehensive review of published evidence was performed. A patient survey was developed to capture patients' experiences.<b>Results:</b> Revisions to the 2005 technical standards for spirometry were made, including the addition of factors that were not previously considered. Evidence to support the revisions was cited when applicable. The experience and expertise of task force members were used to develop recommended best practices.<b>Conclusions:</b> Standards and consensus recommendations are presented for manufacturers, clinicians, operators, and researchers with the aims of increasing the accuracy, precision, and quality of spirometric measurements and improving the patient experience. A comprehensive guide to aid in the implementation of these standards was developed as an online supplement."

The 2005 document integrated the recommendations of an ATS/ERS task force with those from an earlier National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute workshop that led to the publication of background papers between 1995 and 1999 and a consensus workshop report with more in-depth descriptions and discussion. Advancements in hardware and software, new research and emerging approaches have necessitated an update to the 2005 technical standard to guide laboratory directors, physiologists, operators, pulmonologists and manufacturers. Key updates include standardisation of linked spirometry, new equipment quality control and validation recommendations, generalisation of the multiple breath washout concept beyond nitrogen, a new acceptability and grading system with addition of example tracings, and a brief review of imaging and other new techniques to measure lung volumes. Future directions and key research questions are also noted."

        "abstract": "Residual volume (RV) measured by body plethysmography is a routine measurement in clinical pulmonary practice and is often an important outcome variable in clinical trials. However, it is not known what size of improvement can be regarded as being important in severe emphysema patients. Therefore, the aim of the study is to establish the minimal important difference (MID) for RV in severe emphysema patients undergoing bronchoscopic lung volume reduction. 91 severe emphysema patients were included. RV and total lung capacity (TLC) were measured by body plethysmography. MID estimates were calculated by anchor-based and distribution-based methods. Forced expiratory volume in 1 s, 6-min walk distance and St George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score were used as anchors and Cohen's effect size was used as distribution-based method. The calculated MID estimates according to the different anchors and methods ranged between -0.31 and -0.43 L for RV, -6.1 and -8.6% for percentage change in RV (RV%) from baseline, and -2.8 and -4.0% for RV/TLC. These MID estimates are useful for sample size determination in new studies on interventions aimed at reducing RV and for interpreting the results from clinical trials in severe emphysema patients."

        "abstract": "The FEV1 is widely used by physicians in the diagnosis, staging, treatment, monitoring, and establishing prognosis for patients with COPD. The MCID is the smallest difference which patients perceive as beneficial and which would mandate a change in patient management. A precise MCID for FEV1 has not been established. In attempt to establish a MCID for predose or trough FEV1, several limitations need to be addressed. There are issues such as reproducibility, repeatability, acceptability, variability, placebo effect, and equipment effects. Patient factors, such as baseline level of FEV1, albuterol reversibility, diurnal variation, influence the results. Nonetheless, using anchoring techniques, a change in pre dose FEV1 of about 100 mL can be perceived by patients, correlates with fewer relapses following exacerbations and is in the range usually achieved with bronchodilators approved for COPD. In the future, consistent reporting of spirometric variables, such as a predose FEV1 and other outcomes, can be incorporated into a more quantitative effort to establish the MCID. Also distributional/statistical methods may be useful in determining the MCID FEV1."

        "abstract": "The SGRQ is a disease-specific measure of health status for use in COPD. A number of methods have been used for estimating its minimum clinically important difference (MCID). These include both expert and patient preference-based estimates. Anchor-based methods have also been used. The calculated MCID from those studies was consistently around 4 units, regardless of assessment method. By contrast, the MCID calculated using distribution-based methods varied across studies and permitted no consistent estimate. All measurements of clinical significance contain sample and measurement error. They also require value judgements, if not about the calculation of the MCID itself then about the anchors used to estimate it. Under these circumstances, greater weight should be placed upon the overall body of evidence for an MCID, rather than one single method. For that reason, estimates of MCID should be used as indicative values. Methods of analysing clinical trial results should reflect this, and use appropriate statistical tests for comparison with the MCID. Treatments for COPD that produced an improvement in SGRQ of the order of 4 units in clinical trials have subsequently found wide acceptance once in clinical practice, so it seems reasonable to expect any new treatment proposed for COPD to produce an advantage over placebo that is not significantly inferior to a 4-unit difference."

        "abstract": "The concept of a minimal clinically important difference (MCID) is well established. Here, we review the evidence base and methods used to define MCIDs as well as their strengths and limitations. Most MCIDs in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are empirically derived estimates applying to populations of patients. Validated MCIDs are available for many commonly used outcomes in COPD, including lung function (100 ml for trough FEV1), dyspnea (improvement of &#x2265; 1 unit in the Transition Dyspnea Index total score or 5 units in the University of California, San Diego Shortness of Breath Questionnaire), health status (reduction of 4 units in the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score), and exercise capacity (47.5 m for the incremental shuttle walking test, 45-85 s for the endurance shuttle walking test, and 46-105 s for constant-load cycling endurance tests), but there is currently no validated MCID for exacerbations. In a clinical trial setting, many factors, including study duration, withdrawal rate, baseline severity, and Hawthorne effects, can influence the measured treatment effect and determine whether it reaches the MCID. We also address recent challenges presented by clinical trials that compare active treatments and suggest that MCIDs should be used to identify the additional proportion of patients who benefit, for example, when one drug is replaced by another or when a second drug is added to a first. We propose the term \"minimum worthwhile incremental advantage\" to describe this parameter."
