    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the commonest cause of cancer death, with a very poor survival rate. By the time of diagnosis, most cases are at an advanced stage and about 30% present with symptoms caused by central endobronchial obstruction. Endobronchial cryosurgery is an effective technique, which can be used to relieve tracheobronchial obstruction caused by lung cancer. This report describes the technique, using a nitrous oxide cooled cryoprobe, inserted through a bronchoscope, to remove the obstruction and reopen the airway. In this study, 476 consecutive patients (mean age 68.3 years, M:F ratio 1.9:1) with obstructive tracheobronchial tumours underwent a mean of 2.4 cryosurgical treatments. Their TNM staging was, stage II 6.7%, IIIa 21.0%, IIIb 23.9%, IV 48.4%. Improvement in symptom quantification was found with 76.4, 69.0, 59.2, and 42.6% of symptomatic patients for haemoptysis, cough, dyspnoea, and chest pain, respectively. Mean values for respiratory function improved from 1.38 to 1.41 litres for FEV1 and 1.91 to 2.04 litres for FVC ( p 6 0 : 0001). Mean performance status improved from 59.6 to 75.2 for Karnofsky scale and 3.04 to 2.20 for the WHOscale and the complication rate was 3.5% of treatments. The Kaplan-Meier median survival was 8.2 months and 1- and 2-year survival 38.4 and 15.9%, respectively. Survival analysis suggested a possible survival advantage over alternative palliative techniques. Endobronchial cryosurgery provides a safe and effective method for the palliation of otherwise inoperable lung cancer. It has advantages over other methods in terms of safety, cost, and a low complication rate. Cryosurgery can be repeated as often as required. /C211 2004 Published by Elsevier Inc. From January 1995 to June 2002, 476 consecutive patients with obstructive, malignant endobronchial tumours underwent endobronchial cryosurgery in a single institution. These patients were all inoperable by conventional surgical resection because of the advanced stage of the disease, the site of the tumour, poor lung function or the patient /C213 s general health. The study involved recording patient /C213 s symptoms of dyspnoea, cough, haemoptysis, chest pain, dysphagia, anorexia, stridor and depression, respiratory function tests (forced expiratory volume in 1 s, FEV1, and forced vital capacity FVC), performance status (WHO and Karnofsky scales). Diagnostic tests comprised chest X-ray and bronchoscopy in all cases, computed tomography in 38% and mediastinoscopy in 14% of patients. All patients had confirmed pathology, 97.2% histologically and 2.8% by sputum cytology. The majority of the patients were stage IIIb or IV (72%). Patients with stage II or IIIa lung cancer, who were thought unfit for immediate surgical resection, underwent cryosurgery because they were (a) clinically unfit for surgery or (b) for palliation of symptoms, before or after oncological treatment",

A further limitation is the possibility of damage to the bronchial walls, but this has been minimised by the use of JouleThomson type probes with nitrous oxide coolant. There would be advantages, in terms of cell destruction, in using a cryogen with a greater cooling capacity such as liquid nitrogen. Current technology, however, does not allow for probes sufficiently long and narrow (0.5 m /C2 5 mm) to access the tracheobronchial tree, though such systems are being developed. Possible damage to the bronchial walls is also limited by the fact that the trachea and larger bronchi are mainly composed of cartilage, which is resistant to freezing damage. Probes used for endobronchial cryosurgery may be may be rigid, semi-rigid or flexible, and can be used through a rigid bronchoscope, or in the case of"

Such patients may be unsuitable for surgical resection because of the position of the tumour, the disease is in an advanced stage or poor lung function. These patients may only be able to withstand a short general anaesthetic and therefore the procedure should be as quick as possible. This places some limitations on the cryosurgeon in terms of holding time and repeat freeze-thaw cycles. It must be remembered, however, that endobronchial cryosurgery is a palliative technique, with the aim of alleviation of symptoms and improving the patient /C213 s performance status, and so complete cell destruction is desirable but not imperative. Cryosurgical treatment of obstructive endobronchial tumours can open bronchi to allow drainage of infected secretions, and lead to reaeration of collapsed lungs. The effect of this improved oxygenation and general improvement of well being can appear very rapidly."

These mechanisms can be divided into immediate effects and delayed effects. Immediate mechanisms include the physical effect of intracellular ice crystal formation (IIF), the biochemical effect of cell dehydration and shrinkage, and thawing effects [6,14,25]. The delayed effect involves vascular stasis and possibly apoptosis [2,7,9]. The effect of vascular stasis is greater in venules than arterioles [26] where blood velocity and heat transfer are much higher. The local ischaemia has a beneficial effect in clinical practice and cryosurgeons make use of the phenomena to control bleeding from the tumour surface [10]. The predominant mechanism of cell destruction is influenced by the freezing regime, the thermal history of the cell, distance from the probe, tissue vascularity, andthetype of cell being frozen. These effects can be maximised by the cryosurgeon by using rapid cooling, low end temperature, slow thawing, and repeat freeze-thaw cycles [8,20-23,26]."

It improves symptoms, respiratory function, and also quality of life. The technique is easy to perform, economical, has minimal complications, and is well tolerated by the patient.

One hundred six patients (91.4 percent) were treated with the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope. General anesthesia was used in 89.7 percent of treatments; there were four transient anesthetic complications. Three deaths from massive hemorrhage occurred in the first 59 treatments (first 30 patients). After laser power settings were reduced from 90 to 40 W, there were no further incidences of massive hemorrhage or death in the subsequent 117 treatments. The airway caliber was improved in 83.4 percent of treatments. The trachea, mainstem bronchi, and bronchus intermedius airway calibers were improved more often than those of the lobar bronchi. With lower laser power settings, Nd:YAG laser therapy is a safe and effective means of relieving airway obstruction. Thirty-six percent of patients were alive at one year. The median time to retreatment or death was 130 days."

Of these 47, 35 (74.5 percent) underwent both radiation therapy (XRT) and YPR. The survival of these 35 patients (median survival, 304 days) was compared with that of 58 who underwent only palliative palliative XRT (median survival, 253 days) from 1981 to 1983, when YPR was not yet available at our institution. There was no significant difference in overall survival (p = 0.17). A significant increase in survival (p = 0.04) was seen in 15 patients who underwent emergency palliative YPR as the initial therapeutic intervention compared with 11 patients who received emergency palliative XRT but would have received YPR had it been available at that time. A trend toward increased survival was also shown in patients who underwent endobronchial radiation therapy in addition to YPR and XRT."

        "abstract": "As the modern era of cryosurgery began in the mid 1960s, the basic features of cryosurgical technique were established as rapid freezing, slow thawing, and repetition of the freeze-thaw cycle. Since then, new applications of cryosurgery have caused numerous investigations on the mechanism of injury in cryosurgery with the intent to better define appropriate or optimal temperature-time dosimetry of the freeze-thaw cycles. A diversity of opinion has become evident on some aspects of technique, but the basic tenets of cryosurgery remain unchanged. All the parts of the freeze-thaw cycle can cause tissue injury. The cooling rate should be as fast as possible, but it is not as critical as other factors. The coldest tissue temperature is the prime factor in cell death and this should be -50 degreesC in neoplastic tissue. The optimal duration of freezing is not known, but prolonged freezing increases tissue destruction. The thawing rate is a prime destructive factor and it should be as slow as possible. Repetition of the freeze-thaw cycle is well known to be an important factor in effective therapy. A prime need in cryosurgical research is related to the periphery of the cryosurgical lesion where some cells die and others live. Adjunctive therapy should influence the fate of cells in this region and increase the efficacy of cryosurgical techniques."

Interest in research on the effects of freezing on tissue and on new clinical applications was then stimulated. The research led to a better understanding of the mechanisms of cryogenic injury, including cell death by apoptosis, which has emerged as a potential key to the use of adjunctive chemotherapy in the treatment of cancer. Optimization of cryosurgical technique will also improve clinical results."

        "abstract": "Six different freezing/thawing programs, which varied freezing rate, duration of freezing, and thawing rates, were used to investigate the effect of these factors on cell destruction in dog skin. The range of tissue temperatures produced was from -15 to -50 degrees C. The extent of destruction was evaluated by skin biopsies 3 days after cold injury. In single, short freezing/thawing cycles, the temperature reached in the tissue was the prime factor in cell death. Longer freezing time and slow thawing were also important lethal factors which increased destruction of cells. Cooling rate, whether slow or fast, made little difference in the outcome. The experiments suggested that present-day, commonly employed cryosurgical techniques, which feature fast cooling, slow thawing, and repetition of the freeze/thaw cycle, should be modified by the use of maintenance of the tissue in the frozen state for several minutes and slow thawing. Thawing should be complete before freezing is repeated. These modifications in technique will maximize tissue destruction, an important consideration in cancer cryosurgery."

Cryohemostasis was attempted in the past for elective liver surgery but did not gain popularity. During past decades, cryoequipment was refined and successfully used for tumor ablation. The purpose of the present study was to assess the efficacy of cryosurgery as a potential adjuvant hemostatic technique in the treatment of grades III-IV liver injuries. A standard liver crush-evulsion injury was created in pigs. In the control group, the liver was left to bleed freely. In the experimental group, the severed liver surface was immediately frozen to -160 degrees C for 10 min, spontaneously thawed, and left to bleed thereafter. Blood pressure, pulse rate, urine output, and serum lactate were monitored. The total blood loss was measured 180 min after liver injury was inflicted. The volume of frozen liver parenchyma was measured. For further laboratory evaluation, three additional experimental animals were not sacrificed and recovered. Cryohemostasis significantly reduced blood loss and substantially attenuated hemorrhagic shock. The frozen liver parenchyma underwent necrosis but did not jeopardize survival. Cryosurgery may be an efficient adjuvant technique in the early control of hemorrhage in grades III-IV liver injury."

For patients with regional nodal metastases identified at thoracotomy, adjuvant chemotherapy may be of benefit and additional clinical trials are in progress. Locally advanced disease is present in over a third of patients at diagnosis. For patients with marginally resectable tumors, the preliminary results of the neoadjuvant chemotherapy trials are encouraging and may result in an improvement in the 15% 5-year survival in this group. For patients with locally advanced and unresectable tumors, several but not all studies suggest that the combination of chemotherapy and radiation produces better results than radiation alone. Additional trials are needed to clarify these results. In addition, better methods are needed to maintain local control of unresected tumors. Hyperfractionated radiation schedules and concurrent administration of radiosensitizing chemotherapy drugs appear to be the most promising leads. Effective systemic treatment for patients with disseminated disease remains elusive. Several new classes of drugs, especially taxol and the topoisomerase I poisons, are being introduced and have rekindled hope for improved treatment of this large group of patients."

Eight patients had benign disease. A total of 109 Nd-YAG laser tumor ablations were performed. In addition, 32 patients underwent postoperative brachytherapy. Median survival for all patients was 12 months. Patients with bronchogenic carcinoma had a median survival of five months. Fifteen of 20 patients (75%) alive at the time of follow-up reported continued palliation as shown by an improved postoperative Karnofsky score. There was no survival benefit from Nd-YAG laser ablation of endobronchial bronchogenic carcinoma; however, the Nd-YAG laser provided good to excellent palliation in the majority of patients on long-term follow-up."

However, since haphazard freezing does not guarantee tissue destruction, in order to apply this technique effectively it is essential to determine the thermal parameters that produce complete destruction of malignant tissue. This study seeks to quantitatively identify the relationship between thermal variables and the degree of freezing damage to human breast cancer cells. In order to do this, human breast cancer and normal cells were frozen with controlled thermal parameters using a directional solidification apparatus. Cell viability was determined after thawing using trypan blue, and correlated to the thermal variables used during freezing. Cellular damage is observed to increase with increasing cooling rates, due to the higher probability of intracellular ice formation. A double freeze thaw cycle significantly increases the extent of cell damage, and is sufficient to ensure complete cell destruction at final freezing temperatures of -40 degrees C for a 25 degrees C/min cooling rate, and -20 degrees C for a 50 degrees C/min cooling rate. The correlations between cell death and thermal parameters are qualitatively identical for all the cell types in this study, although there is some variation from one cell type to another in the overall susceptibility to freezing damage. The correlations established in this study can be used to design systematic and optimal breast cryosurgery protocols."

        "abstract": "Hepatic cryotherapy is a relatively new technique used to treat both primary and secondary tumors. This paper concerns the changes in serum aspartate transaminase (AST) in 45 patients following both single and double freeze with partial thaw cycles. There was considerable elevation in serum AST, greatest on the day of operation, and there was a significantly higher peak AST following the double-freeze cycles (1159; SE, 117.5) compared with single-freeze/thaw procedures (437; SE, 61.7). This finding indicates greater hepatocellular disruption which may be important both in planning clinical hepatic cryosurgery to achieve adequate destruction and also to avoid the morbidity of the cryoshock phenomenon."

Cryosurgery, however, cannot be applied precisely without knowing how the thermal variables used during the procedure affect tissue destruction. The goal of this article is to provide quantitative values for the relationship between thermal variables during freezing and the destruction of human primary prostatic adenocarcinoma cells."

Symptoms, lung function, and chest radiographic and bronchoscopic findings were recorded serially before and after 81 cryotherapy sessions in 33 consecutive patients. Most patients improved in terms of overall symptoms, stridor, and haemoptysis and they had an overall improvement in dyspnoea. Objective improvement in lung function was seen in 58% of patients and the changes in lung function correlated with symptoms. Bronchoscopic evidence of relief of bronchial obstruction was seen in 77% of patients and 24% showed improvement in degree of collapse on the radiograph. There were no important complications. These results compare favourably with the results in published series of patients having laser therapy. It is concluded that bronchoscopic cryotherapy is valuable for the palliation of inoperable bronchial carcinoma."

The tissues are apparently unaltered at thaw but progressive necrosis ensues. There is controversy as to whether tissue death is principally due to the direct effects of freezing or to subsequent ischaemia. Studies at the ultrastructural level show that ice-crystals are formed within the cells during cryosurgery, that resultant cell damage is osmotic rather than mechanical and that microcirculatory changes are secondary in terms of the chronological development of tissue necrosis."
