Then the trocar is inserted in a corkscrew motion until the sudden release of resistance (after passing the costal pleura) is felt, while holding the handle of the trocar firmly in the palm of the hand, as the extended index finger, for safety's sake, limits the depth of insertion needed to reach the pleural space, previously established with the local anaesthetic needle. While the trocar is in the pleural cavity, the trocar is removed and the cannula should lie 1-3 cm within the pleural cavity and be held in position by the assistant. Then the thoracoscope is placed in the cannula and advanced into the pleural cavity under direct vision through the trocar. If necessary, the pleural fluid is removed with a suction catheter or directly through the working channel of the semi-rigid pleuroscope. In cases of a large pleural effusion, the fluid should be aspirated completely and not too hastily.

        "abstract": "\"Medical\" thoracoscopy as compared with \"surgical\" thoracoscopy (which is more precisely known as video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS)) has the advantage that it can be performed under local anaesthesia or conscious sedation, in an endoscopy suite, using nondisposible rigid instruments. Thus, it is considerably less invasive and less expensive. The main diagnostic and therapeutic indications for medical thoracoscopy are pleural effusions and pneumothorax. Due to its high diagnostic accuracy, approaching almost 100% in malignant and tuberculous pleural effusions, it should be used when pleural fluid analysis and needle biopsy are nondiagnostic. In addition, medical thoracoscopy provides staging for lung cancer and diffuse malignant mesothelioma. Talc poudrage, as the best conservative method for pleurodesis in 1998, can also be performed with medical thoracoscopy. It can also be effectively used in the early management of empyema. In spontaneous pneumothorax it allows staging, thereby facilitating treatment decisions, and in addition coagulation of eventual blebs and talc poudrage for efficient pleurodesis. Medical thoracoscopy is a safe procedure which is even easier to learn than flexible bronchoscopy. Due to its high diagnostic and therapeutic efficiency, it should be applied increasingly in the management of the above-mentioned pleuropulmonary diseases."
