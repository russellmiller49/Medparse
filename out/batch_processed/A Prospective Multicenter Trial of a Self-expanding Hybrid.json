Metal stents can be placed using flexible bronchoscopy under local anesthesia but may be difficult to remove. Silicone stents require rigid bronchoscopy and general anesthesia to place but they are relatively easy to remove. A new hybrid stent, the AERO stent (Alveolus Inc, Charlotte, NC), has a completely covered nitinol framework. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this new hybrid stent for the treatment of malignant airway obstruction."

Eligible patients with malignant airway obstruction underwent self-expanding hybrid stent placement at 11 centers between June 2005 and December 2006. Patients were evaluated immediately postprocedure and at 7, 30, and 90 days postprocedure. Ease of deployment was assessed on a 4-point Likert scale. Luminal patency was visually assessed preimplant and postimplant by investigators and verified in blinded review of photographs taken during the procedure. Quality of life was measured using the Baseline Dyspnea Index and Transitional Dyspnea Index."

Dyspnea indices demonstrated quality of life improvement postimplant as compared with baseline values (average improvement in Transitional Dyspnea Index of 2.9 at 7d and 3.2 at 30d, P <0.05) Complications included hemoptysis, infection, granulation tissue formation, stent migration, and pain at rates comparable with previously published studies.

Silicone stents have been available and routinely used since the 1980s. 1,2 They are usually placed using a rigid bronchoscope, under general anesthesia, in the operating room. They have both positive and negative attributes. Advantages of silicone stents include the fact that there is much published data on their use. They are efficacious and inexpensive. In addition, these stents can be removed if needed. The disadvantages include: a need for general anesthesia and a trip to the operating room. In addition, granulation tissue formation around the stent and mucous formation within the stent is common."

The self-expanding hybrid stent could be placed in the bronchoscopy laboratory under conscious sedation (a strength of selfexpanding metallic stents 4 ) but could be easily removed when needed (a strength of the silicone stent 4 ). The rate of immediate palliation is consistent with other studies in which metallic stents have been used. 5 Early complication rates are also consistent with published literature. In a study of 82 patients with benign and malignant disease, 54.8% of patients required additional procedures to control granulation tissue formation and disease recurrence (tumor in-growth) postimplant. 6 Another study which included 27 patients had an overall complication rate of 50%. Secretion retention in 18% of the patients required additional interventional procedures and 15% of the patients' experienced recurrent dyspnea from granulation tissue formation at the end of the stent. 7 In this study, we observed 3 instances of slight granulation tissue formation which did not require ablation, no instance of tumor in-growth and no occlusion by secretions, though larger studies are needed to confirm these findings. The rate of migration is higher than what one would see with metallic stents yet, within range of what is found with silicone stents. 5 Since the completion of this trial the stent has been modified and struts have been added to reduce the rate of migration. We have reasons to believe that this goal can be accomplished."

Not surprisingly in this cancer population, a number of patients died before the end of the study, though none were related to stent placement. Transitional dyspnea scores were not available for many of the patients at the 90-day follow-up due to inability to travel, entrance into hospice care, or loss to follow-up.

Its outside surface bears regularly placed studs to prevent displacement. First results are encouraging. So far, 118 prostheses have been placed in 66 patients. Tolerance was excellent and complications were rare. Migration occurred 12 times: in seven cases an early prototype that was poorly designed had been used. Obstruction was noted in two cases without major problems. Mean follow-up at the time of this writing is three months, with the longest follow-up 19 months."

        "abstract": "To improve the clinical measurement of dyspnea, we developed a baseline dyspnea index that rated the severity of dyspnea at a single state and a transition dyspnea index that denoted changes from that baseline. The scores in both indexes depend on ratings for three different categories: functional impairment; magnitude of task, and magnitude of effort. At the baseline state, dyspnea was rated in five grades from 0 (severe) to 4 (unimpaired) for each category. The ratings for each of the three categories were added to form a baseline focal score (range, 0 to 12). At the transition period, changes in dyspnea were rated by seven grades, ranging from -3 (major deterioration), to +3 (major improvement). The ratings for each of the three categories were added to form a transition focal score (range, -9 to +9). In 38 patients tested with respiratory disease, interobserver agreement was highly satisfactory for both indexes. The baseline focal score had the highest correlation (r = 0.60; P less than 0.001) with the 12-minute walking distance (12 MW), while significant, but lower, correlations existed for lung function. For the transition focal score, there was a significant correlation only with the 12 MW (r = 0.33; p = 0.04). These results indicate that dyspnea can receive a direct clinical rating that provides important information not disclosed by customary physiologic tests."

A hydrophilic coating in the inner lumen of the stent shall minimize mucous adherence and accumulation. Because the device is cut from a tube of nitinol with a unique design, the stent does not foreshorten or elongate upon delivery. The stent has a slightly larger diameter near the distal and proximal ends (Fig. 1). Both ends are slightly vaulted inwardly to minimize possible airway injury and the formation of granulation tissue at the stent edges.",
          "egree of lumen occlusion before stent placement was 82%. Improvement in luminal patency was noted in 88% of patients as defined by an increase in luminal diameter of Z 50% ( P <0.05). Success is comparable with images seen in Figures 2 and 3. Dyspnea indices improved after stenting compared with baseline values with an average improvement of 2.9 at 7 days and 3.2 at 30 days ( P <0.05). Improvement at 90 days was not clinically significant ( P Z 0.05) (Table 2). Physician satisfaction with the deployment of the stent was high. Six aspects of the deployment system, including guidewire passage through the catheter, catheter passage into airway, stent release, catheter removal from airway, visualization, and accuracy of stent placement were rated on a 4-point scale where 4 = excellent and 1 = poor. A final average score between ''good'' (3) and ''excellent'' (4) was reported for each aspect with an overall average of 3.57. The stent was determined to be easily deployed.",
          "elf-expanding stent. The self-expanding hybrid stent provided immediate palliation in nearly all patients with a reasonable complication rate. It provides some of the strengths of both the silicone and metallic stents while eliminating some of the weaknesses. The self-expanding hybrid stent could be placed in the bronchoscopy laboratory under conscious sedation (a strength of selfexpanding metallic stents 4 ) but could be easily removed when needed (a strength of the silicone stent 4 ). The rate of immediate palliation is consistent with other studies in which metallic stents have been used. 5 Early complication rates are also consistent with published literature. In a study of 82 patients with benign and malignant disease, 54.8% of patients required additional procedures to control granulation tissue formation and disease recurrence (tumor in-growth) postimplant. 6 Another study which included 27 patients had an overall complication rate of 50%. Secretion retention in 18% of the patients required additional interventional procedures and 15% of the patients' experienced recurrent dyspnea from granulation tissue formation at the end of the stent. 7 In this study, we observed 3 instances of slight granulation tissue formation which did not require ablation, no instance of tumor in-growth and no occlusion by secretions, though larger studies are needed to confirm these findings. The rate of migration is higher than what one would see with metallic stents yet, within range of what is found with silicone stents. 5 Since the completion of this trial the stent has been modified and struts have been added to reduce the rate of migration. We have reasons to believe that this goal can be accomplished.",

A hydrophilic coating in the inner lumen of the stent shall minimize mucous adherence and accumulation. Because the device is cut from a tube of nitinol with a unique design, the stent does not foreshorten or elongate upon delivery. The stent has a slightly larger diameter near the distal and proximal ends (Fig. 1). Both ends are slightly vaulted inwardly to minimize possible airway injury and the formation of granulation tissue at the stent edges.",
          "egree of lumen occlusion before stent placement was 82%. Improvement in luminal patency was noted in 88% of patients as defined by an increase in luminal diameter of Z 50% ( P <0.05). Success is comparable with images seen in Figures 2 and 3. Dyspnea indices improved after stenting compared with baseline values with an average improvement of 2.9 at 7 days and 3.2 at 30 days ( P <0.05). Improvement at 90 days was not clinically significant ( P Z 0.05) (Table 2). Physician satisfaction with the deployment of the stent was high. Six aspects of the deployment system, including guidewire passage through the catheter, catheter passage into airway, stent release, catheter removal from airway, visualization, and accuracy of stent placement were rated on a 4-point scale where 4 = excellent and 1 = poor. A final average score between ''good'' (3) and ''excellent'' (4) was reported for each aspect with an overall average of 3.57. The stent was determined to be easily deployed.",
          "elf-expanding stent. The self-expanding hybrid stent provided immediate palliation in nearly all patients with a reasonable complication rate. It provides some of the strengths of both the silicone and metallic stents while eliminating some of the weaknesses. The self-expanding hybrid stent could be placed in the bronchoscopy laboratory under conscious sedation (a strength of selfexpanding metallic stents 4 ) but could be easily removed when needed (a strength of the silicone stent 4 ). The rate of immediate palliation is consistent with other studies in which metallic stents have been used. 5 Early complication rates are also consistent with published literature. In a study of 82 patients with benign and malignant disease, 54.8% of patients required additional procedures to control granulation tissue formation and disease recurrence (tumor in-growth) postimplant. 6 Another study which included 27 patients had an overall complication rate of 50%. Secretion retention in 18% of the patients required additional interventional procedures and 15% of the patients' experienced recurrent dyspnea from granulation tissue formation at the end of the stent. 7 In this study, we observed 3 instances of slight granulation tissue formation which did not require ablation, no instance of tumor in-growth and no occlusion by secretions, though larger studies are needed to confirm these findings. The rate of migration is higher than what one would see with metallic stents yet, within range of what is found with silicone stents. 5 Since the completion of this trial the stent has been modified and struts have been added to reduce the rate of migration. We have reasons to believe that this goal can be accomplished.",

A hydrophilic coating in the inner lumen of the stent shall minimize mucous adherence and accumulation. Because the device is cut from a tube of nitinol with a unique design, the stent does not foreshorten or elongate upon delivery. The stent has a slightly larger diameter near the distal and proximal ends (Fig. 1). Both ends are slightly vaulted inwardly to minimize possible airway injury and the formation of granulation tissue at the stent edges.",

Success is comparable with images seen in Figures 2 and 3. Dyspnea indices improved after stenting compared with baseline values with an average improvement of 2.9 at 7 days and 3.2 at 30 days ( P <0.05). Improvement at 90 days was not clinically significant ( P Z 0.05) (Table 2). Physician satisfaction with the deployment of the stent was high. Six aspects of the deployment system, including guidewire passage through the catheter, catheter passage into airway, stent release, catheter removal from airway, visualization, and accuracy of stent placement were rated on a 4-point scale where 4 = excellent and 1 = poor. A final average score between ''good'' (3) and ''excellent'' (4) was reported for each aspect with an overall average of 3.57. The stent was determined to be easily deployed.",

It provides some of the strengths of both the silicone and metallic stents while eliminating some of the weaknesses. The self-expanding hybrid stent could be placed in the bronchoscopy laboratory under conscious sedation (a strength of selfexpanding metallic stents 4 ) but could be easily removed when needed (a strength of the silicone stent 4 ). The rate of immediate palliation is consistent with other studies in which metallic stents have been used. 5 Early complication rates are also consistent with published literature. In a study of 82 patients with benign and malignant disease, 54.8% of patients required additional procedures to control granulation tissue formation and disease recurrence (tumor in-growth) postimplant. 6 Another study which included 27 patients had an overall complication rate of 50%. Secretion retention in 18% of the patients required additional interventional procedures and 15% of the patients' experienced recurrent dyspnea from granulation tissue formation at the end of the stent. 7 In this study, we observed 3 instances of slight granulation tissue formation which did not require ablation, no instance of tumor in-growth and no occlusion by secretions, though larger studies are needed to confirm these findings. The rate of migration is higher than what one would see with metallic stents yet, within range of what is found with silicone stents. 5 Since the completion of this trial the stent has been modified and struts have been added to reduce the rate of migration. We have reasons to believe that this goal can be accomplished.",
