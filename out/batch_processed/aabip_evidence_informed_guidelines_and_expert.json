Our goal was to provide a framework based on the best available evidence and where data was lacking expert opinion. In developing our document, we utilized the TCBS approach, 7 which results in unbiased, scienti /uniFB01 cally valid, standards-compliant, and trustworthy guidance. However, despite what we considered a rigorous methodological process for synthesizing and reporting the evidence, we acknowledge limitations to our recommendations."

Examples include the use of serial examinations of pleural cytology or biomarkers to guide interventions, and the role of maintaining a daily drainage log."

Consequently, despite our methods, we were unable to provide any guidance with strength exceeding that of suggestions.

In this project, searches were not peer-reviewed by objective medical librarians, and quality assessments were made by only 1 methodologist and not con /uniFB01 rmed by dual critiques. However, the authors believe that the risk of missing relevant manuscripts by not including a librarian in the literature search is low since the body of literature dedicated to the management of IPCs for the management of MPEs is relatively small. Also, through a combination of the PubMed search developed by the authors and the manual searches performed by the panel membership (who are very familiar with the existing literature within the /uniFB01 eld), the authors feel con/uniFB01 dent that the literature review was suf /uniFB01 ciently comprehensive. While dual quality assessments by 2 methodologists is ideal, the decision was made to limit to a single methodologist due to cost restraints. Given the small number of articles which underwent methodological assessment, all of which clearly had high/serious risks of bias, the authors do not believe that this altered the /uniFB01 nal conclusions."

There are multiple other provider specialties which are involved in the placement of IPCs for MPEs as well as patient monitoring and management of complication, such as thoracic surgeons, interventional radiologists, oncologists, and infectious disease specialists.

        "abstract": "Guideline development processes vary substantially, and many guidelines do not meet basic quality criteria. Standards for guideline development can help organizations ensure that recommendations are evidence-based and can help users identify high-quality guidelines. Such organizations as the U.S. Institute of Medicine and the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence have developed recommendations to define trustworthy guidelines within their locales. Many groups charged with guideline development find the lengthy list of standards developed by such organizations to be aspirational but infeasible to follow in entirety. Founded in 2002, the Guidelines International Network (G-I-N) is a network of guideline developers that includes 93 organizations and 89 individual members representing 46 countries. The G-I-N board of trustees recognized the importance of guideline development processes that are both rigorous and feasible even for modestly funded groups to implement and initiated an effort toward consensus about minimum standards for high-quality guidelines. In contrast to other existing standards for guideline development at national or local levels, the key components proposed by G-I-N will represent the consensus of an international, multidisciplinary group of active guideline developers. This article presents G-I-N's proposed set of key components for guideline development. These key components address panel composition, decision-making process, conflicts of interest, guideline objective, development methods, evidence review, basis of recommendations, ratings of evidence and recommendations, guideline review, updating processes, and funding.

        "abstract": "The American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) has been at the forefront of evidence-based clinical practice guideline development for more than 2 decades. In 2006, CHEST adopted a modified system of Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) to support their rigorous guideline development methodology. The evolution of CHEST's Living Guidelines Model, as well as their collaborative efforts with other organizations, has necessitated improvements in their guideline development methodology. CHEST has made the decision to transition to the standard GRADE method for rating the certainty of evidence and grading recommendations in their evidence-based clinical practice guidelines, a deviation from the modified approach that was adopted in 2006. The standard GRADE approach will be used to grade recommendations in all CHEST guidelines, including updates to previously published guidelines. CHEST's adoption of a standard GRADE approach will ensure that its guideline development methodology is more consistent with that used by other organizations, will better align evidence synthesis methods, and will result in more explicit and easy to understand recommendations."

Advocates suggest that, when properly employed, consensus strategies can create structured environments in which experts are given the best available information, allowing their solutions to problems to be more justifiable and credible than otherwise. This paper surveys the characteristics of several major methods (Delphi, Nominal Group, and models developed by the National Institutes of Health and Glaser) and provides guidelines for those who want to use the techniques. Among the concerns these guidelines address are selecting problems, choosing members for consensus panels, specifying acceptable levels of agreement, properly using empirical data, obtaining professional and political support, and disseminating results."

        "abstract": "Malignant pleural effusions in the presence of trapped lung remain notoriously difficult to treat. Various methods exist ranging from minimally invasive procedures including repeated needle thoracocentesis to the need for a formal surgical procedure such as placement of a pleuroperitoneal shunt and even thoracotomy and decortication. Controversy exists as to what is the optimum treatment for this condition. Any planned treatment should balance the therapeutic benefit provided against convalesce for a disease with a limited life expectancy. Patients should not spend a significant proportion of their remaining life span recovering from palliative procedures. In a series of patients with malignant pleural effusion the medial survival time was 20 weeks, with 30 days and 1 year mortality rates of 12.8% and 83.6%, respectively. We describe our five-year experience with the use of indwelling PleurX catheters in patients with malignant pleural effusions in the presence of confirmed trapped lung on radiological or VATS investigation. Patient health related quality of life was investigated by telephone questionnaire. The parameters analysed were symptomatic relief, mobility and ease of management following insertion. One hundred and sixteen patients underwent PleurX catheter insertion by a single operator, 48 questionnaires were completed. Of the 48 cases analysed, improvement in all three quality of life indices was recorded following catheter insertion. Ease of mobility was recorded as moderately satisfied and very satisfied in 50% and 15% of patients, respectively. Symptomatic improvement was found to have been increased with 42% and 6% of patients responding to moderately satisfied and very satisfied, respectively. Ease of management was recorded as 'slightly satisfied' and moderately satisfied in 50% and 33% of patients, respectively, demonstrating a high satisfaction index in patients with chronic progressively debilitating malignancies. Complications were either transient or readily correctable. Pain was the predominant complication occurring in 35% of patients lasting &lt;3 days. No patient required catheter removal for resolution of discomfort. Our findings support the use of PleurX catheters for palliative patients with malignant pleural effusions in the presence of trapped lung. The catheters are not only easy to insert and discrete but they can be managed effectively by patients and community nurse practitioners and prevent repeated admissions to hospital in palliative patients with compromised life expectancy."

IPC use is safe compared to talc pleurodesis, though complications can occur. Pleural infection affects &lt;5% of patients, and is usually responsive to antibiotic treatment without requiring catheter removal or surgery. Pleural loculations develop over time, limiting drainage in 10% of patients, which can be improved with intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy. Catheter tract metastasis can occur with most tumours but is more common in mesothelioma. The metastases usually respond to analgaesics and/or external radiotherapy. Long-term intermittent drainage of exudative effusions or chylothorax can potentially lead to loss of nutrients, though no data exist on any clinical impact. Fibrin clots within the catheter lumen can result in blockage. Chest pain following IPC insertion is often mild, and adjustments in analgaesics and drainage practice are usually all that are required. As clinical experience with the use of IPC accumulates, the profile and natural course of complications are increasingly described. We aim to summarise the available literature on IPC-related complications and the evidence to support specific strategies."

IPCs are designed to be secured in situ indefinitely; however, in selected patients, IPCs can be removed when drainage ceases. This case series reports complications of removal of IPCs that resulted in fractured catheters or necessitated deliberate severing of the catheters. From the combined data of two pleural centers, 61 of 170 IPCs inserted (35.9%) were removed. In six cases (9.8%), the removals were complicated, leading to fracture or iatrogenic severing of the IPC. Although four patients had catheter fragments retained within the pleural space, none developed any complications (eg, pain or infection) (median follow-up, 459 days; range, 113-1,119 days), despite two patients undergoing subsequent chemotherapy. Clinicians should be aware that IPC removal can be problematic, but retained fragments are safe, and aggressive retrieval is unnecessary."

        "abstract": "Pleural infection remains a global health burden associated with significant morbidity. Drainage of the infected pleural fluid is important but can often be hindered by septations and loculations. Intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy alone, to break pleural adhesions, has shown no convincing advantages over placebo in improving clinical outcome. Deoxyribonucleoprotein from degradation of leukocytes contributes significantly to high viscosity of infected pleural fluid. Recombinant deoxyribonuclease (DNase) is effective in reducing pleural fluid viscosity in pre-clinical studies. The combination of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and DNase was effective in animal model experiments of empyema. The benefits were established in a randomized clinical trial: those (n=48) treated with tPA/DNase had significantly improved radiological outcomes and reduced need of surgery and duration of hospital stay. A longitudinal observational series of 107 patients further confirmed the effectiveness and safety of tPA/DNase therapy, including its use as 'rescue therapy' when patients failed to respond to antibiotics and chest tube drainage. Overall, a short course of intrapleural tPA (10 mg) and DNase (5 mg) therapy provides a cure in over 90% of patients without requiring surgery. The treatment stimulates pleural fluid formation, enhances radiographic clearance and resolution of systemic inflammation. Serious complications are uncommon; pleural bleeding requiring transfusion occurred in ~2% of cases. Pain can occur, especially with the first dose. Treatment is contraindicated in those with significant bleeding diathesis or a bronchopleural fistula. Future research is required to optimize dosing regimens and in refining patient selection."

        "abstract": "Though biofilms were first described by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, the theory describing the biofilm process was not developed until 1978. We now understand that biofilms are universal, occurring in aquatic and industrial water systems as well as a large number of environments and medical devices relevant for public health. Using tools such as the scanning electron microscope and, more recently, the confocal laser scanning microscope, biofilm researchers now understand that biofilms are not unstructured, homogeneous deposits of cells and accumulated slime, but complex communities of surface-associated cells enclosed in a polymer matrix containing open water channels. Further studies have shown that the biofilm phenotype can be described in terms of the genes expressed by biofilm-associated cells. Microorganisms growing in a biofilm are highly resistant to antimicrobial agents by one or more mechanisms. Biofilm-associated microorganisms have been shown to be associated with several human diseases, such as native valve endocarditis and cystic fibrosis, and to colonize a wide variety of medical devices. Though epidemiologic evidence points to biofilms as a source of several infectious diseases, the exact mechanisms by which biofilm-associated microorganisms elicit disease are poorly understood. Detachment of cells or cell aggregates, production of endotoxin, increased resistance to the host immune system, and provision of a niche for the generation of resistant organisms are all biofilm processes which could initiate the disease process. Effective strategies to prevent or control biofilms on medical devices must take into consideration the unique and tenacious nature of biofilms. Current intervention strategies are designed to prevent initial device colonization, minimize microbial cell attachment to the device, penetrate the biofilm matrix and kill the associated cells, or remove the device from the patient. In the future, treatments may be based on inhibition of genes involved in cell attachment and biofilm formation."

Ultrasonography is a readily available diagnostic tool used by pulmonologists on a daily basis. Ultrasonography has been used to identify the etiology of indwelling peritoneal catheter obstruction, including infection of the exit site and tunnel tract. The use of ultrasonography to identify tunnel-tract infection involving IPC has not been reported. We describe the ultrasonographic characteristics of 3 cases of confirmed tunnel-tract infection and compared them with noninfected chronic IPCs. Ultrasonographic evaluation of the soft tissue tunnel tract can accurately identify fluid collections around the catheter and cuff, which is highly suggestive of tunnel-tract infection."

Previous epidemiologic studies have indicated that empyema is increasing in prevalence, which underscores the importance of urgent diagnosis and effective drainage to improve clinical outcomes. Unfortunately, limited evidence exists to guide clinicians in selecting the ideal drainage intervention for a specific patient because of the broad variation that exists in the intrapleural extent of infection, presence of locules, comorbid features, respiratory status, and virulence of the underlying pathogen. Moreover, many patients experience delays in both the recognition of infected pleural fluid and the initiation of appropriate measures to drain the pleural space. The present review provides an update on the pathogenesis and interventional therapy of pleural infections with an emphasis on the unique role of image-guided drainage with small-bore catheters."

The tube should be attached to a drainage system, such as one-, two-, or three-compartment devices, a one-way (Heimlich) valve for ambulatory drainage, a digital system, or a vacuum bottle. The frequently employed three-compartment systems, currently integrated disposable units, allow adjustment of negative pressure or no suction (water seal), and include an air leak meter on the water seal chamber to be used for demonstrating and quantifying air leak. These readings are subjective and prone to interobserver variability. Digital pleural drainage systems offer the benefits of quantification of any air leak and pleural pressure. Indwelling pleural catheters, typically utilized for malignant pleural effusion, can be drained using vacuum bottles. Knowledge of the design and functionality of each device in the setting of an individual patient's specific pleural process facilitates the selection of practical and financially prudent chest tube drainage strategies."

The exit site or tunnel infection was diagnosed at the time or shortly after the patient presented with peritonitis in 66% of the episodes. In the other one third the exit site or tunnel infection was diagnosed a median of 40 days prior to the development of peritonitis. Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 52% of episodes. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the next most common organism. In 63 (72%) of the episodes the catheter was removed to resolve the infection at a median of 8 days (range, 0 to 226 days) from the onset of peritonitis. Catheter removal after 5 days predominately for refractory peritonitis (n = 23; median time to removal, 8 days) or relapsing peritonitis (n = 11; median time to catheter removal, 103 days). Patients with relapsing peritonitis suffered two to four episodes prior to removal of the catheter. Patients with peritonitis associated with tunnel infection were more likely to lose their catheter than patients with peritonitis associated with exit site infection (86% v 58%), while Staphylococcus epidermidis infections were less likely to result in catheter loss compared with all other organisms (15% v 82%). After a protocol to reduce S aureus catheter infections was implemented in 1990, the rate of catheter-related peritonitis decreased from 0.14/yr to 0.05/yr due to a decrease in S aureus episodes. We conclude that peritonitis episodes associated with a tunnel infection infrequently resolve without catheter removal. Delayed catheter removal in such circumstances often results in refractory or relapsing peritonitis. Therefore, catheter removal should be done promptly. Antibiotic prophylaxis for S aureus can reduce catheter-related peritonitis."
