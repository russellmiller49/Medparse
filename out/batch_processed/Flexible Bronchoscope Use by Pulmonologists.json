This study was a retrospective analysis of 40 consecutive head and neck cancer patients referred for PEG placement, between 2005 and 2014, using a transnasal route because of the impossibility of intubation through the oral cavity. Demographics, outcome of TNPEG procedure, indications for bronchoscopic approach (prophylactic/palliative), clinical need for bronchoscopy (trismus, oropharyngeal obstruction), location of cancer, complications, and overall survival were reviewed. In 40 TN-PEG procedures, executed by 1 of 3 pulmonologists, 39 were successfully placed and there were no immediate complications. All except 1 complication were minor, but no surgery or PEG removal was required. There was a rapid learning curve among all operators. A combined TN-PEG placement by a gastroenterologist and a pulmonologist is a safe and useful option for these patients; the learning curve for successfully performing the procedure was short."

Complications occurred in 9/39 patients: early (less than a week after the procedure) in 4/9 (local infection treated pharmacologically) and late in 5/9 (3 cases of local infections, 1 case of extrusion, 1 Buried Bumper syndrome). Our 10% rate of early infections (presumably because of infectious agents transported along the PEG tube, even with the use of prophylactic antibiotics) is in the range cited in the literature. 3 Buried Bumper syndrome is a complication that occurs when the internal bumper of a PEG tube erodes and migrates through the gastric wall, becoming lodged between the gastric wall and the skin. This complication is solved by replacing the PEG tube through the same route using a guidewire or, if the gastric ori /uniFB01 ce becomes totally closed, repeating the endoscopic procedure. No complications required surgery or PEG removal. On follow-up, 10/39 patients were alive and 7 were in remission. In all 29 patients died, 27 because of disease progression and 2 others because of unrelated causes. No immediate ( /uniFB01 rst 24 h) mechanical or traumatic complications occurred, particularly with the use of the adapted suction/ insuf /uniFB02 ation device."

The learning curve is fast, however, demanding some mandatory steps including the following: knowledge about how to enter and pass the esophagus, how to distend it, how to maneuver inside the stomach and maintain it distended, how to /uniFB01 nd the anterior gastric wall for adequate transillumination, and how to catch and hold the guidewire."

The use of a 600 mm length bronchoscope (instead of an 1100 mm conventional gastroscope), suitable for an average size population, was not related to a higher rate of unsuccessful placements (only 2.5% failures in our series over a 10 y period)."

        "abstract": "Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is the preferred route of feeding and nutritional support in patients with a functional gastrointestinal system who require long-term enteral nutrition. Besides its well-known advantages over parenteral nutrition, PEG offers superior access to the gastrointestinal system over surgical methods. Considering that nowadays PEG tube placement is one of the most common endoscopic procedures performed worldwide, knowing its indications and contraindications is of paramount importance in current medicine. PEG tubes are sometimes placed inappropriately in patients unable to tolerate adequate oral intake because of incorrect and unrealistic understanding of their indications and what they can accomplish. Broadly, the two main indications of PEG tube placement are enteral feeding and stomach decompression. On the other hand, distal enteral obstruction, severe uncorrectable coagulopathy and hemodynamic instability constitute the main absolute contraindications for PEG tube placement in hospitalized patients. Although generally considered to be a safe procedure, there is the potential for both minor and major complications. Awareness of these potential complications, as well as understanding routine aftercare of the catheter, can improve the quality of care for patients with a PEG tube. These complications can generally be classified into three major categories: endoscopic technical difficulties, PEG procedure-related complications and late complications associated with PEG tube use and wound care. In this review we describe a variety of minor and major tube-related complications as well as strategies for their management and avoidance. Different methods of percutaneous PEG tube placement into the stomach have been described in the literature with the \"pull\" technique being the most common method. In the last section of this review, the reader is presented with a brief discussion of these procedures, techniques and related issues. Despite the mentioned PEG tube placement complications, this procedure has gained worldwide popularity as a safe enteral access for nutrition in patients with a functional gastrointestinal system."
