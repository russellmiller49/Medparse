They are performed to facilitate care and promote healing. They also help prevent complications from prolonged endotracheal intubation and malnutrition. In most cases, both are performed simultaneously. Physicians performing them require knowledge of local anatomy, tissue and vascular relationships, along with advance bronchoscopy and endoscopy skills. Although PDTs and PEGs are considered relatively low-risk procedures, operators need to have the knowledge and skill to recognize and prevent adverse outcomes. Current published literature on post-procedural care and stoma wound management was reviewed. Available recommendations for the routine care of tracheostomy and PEG tubes are included in this review. Signs and symptoms of early PDTand PEG-related complications and their management are discussed in detail. These include hemorrhage, infection, accidental decannulation, tube obstruction, clogging, and dislodgement. Rare, life-threatening complications are also discussed. Multidisciplinary teams are needed for improved patient care, and members should be aware of all pertinent care aspects and potential complications related to PDT and PEG placement. Each institute is strongly encouraged to have detailed protocols to standardize care. This review provides a state-of-the-art guidance on the care of patients with tracheostomies and gastrostomies specifically in the ICU setting."

The procedure was transformed when Ciaglia introduced the PDT method in 1985 (7). In a recent review evaluating 22 studies with a total of 1,608 patients [813 PDT, 795 open surgical tracheostomy (ST)], there was no statistically significant difference between PDT and ST in rates of mortality, intra-operative hemorrhage, and post-operative hemorrhage. However, there was a statistically significant difference favoring PDT in decreasing infection risk and procedure time (8). Similarly, a Cochrane review concluded no difference in rates of mortality directly related to the procedure, serious life-threatening intra-operative adverse events, major bleeding, tracheostomy tube occlusion, or accidental decannulation. It also corroborated that PDT had lower rates of wound infection and unfavorable scarring (9)."

Metal tracheostomy tubes are  also  available  and  can  be  utilized  for  long-term tracheostomies in stable non-ventilated patients. However, they are not commonly used due to their expense, rigid construction, and lack of a cuff (13). Regardless of the manufacturer, tracheostomy tubes share common features: the dimensions are given by the inner diameter (I.D.), outer diameter (O.D.), length, and curvature. These numbers are often marked on the flange. Tubes can be cuffed or uncuffed, and some may be fenestrated. They may also include a removable inner cannula, referred to as dualcannula tracheostomy tubes (14) ( Figure 1 ).",

Then, a needle is  placed into the trachea, and the tract is dilated using a  Seldinger technique. This can be done under direct bronchoscopic visualization or ultrasound guidance (15,16). Various techniques are available for ST, which are performed by surgeons most commonly in the operating room and with direct visualization. A common technique is to create a 'trap door' (Björk flap) by pulling a small part of the tracheal cartilage inferiorly and suturing it to the skin (17). This is important to recognize as the flap facilitates reinsertion of the tube if accidental decannulation occurs. Regardless of the method, routine care of tracheostomy tubes is required to prevent complications. Nursing staff and respiratory therapists should be educated on proper care techniques, early signs of complications, and initial steps in managing and stabilizing these complications. Each institution should also have its own standard policies and procedures for post-procedural care."

It is important to ensure that the in-line suction catheter has been exchanged to one shorter than that used when the patient was orally or nasally intubated to help prevent deep suction trauma ( Figure 3 ). Suctioning should be limited to the length of the tracheostomy tube. Excessive deep suctioning risks mucosal trauma, whereas inadequate suctioning increases risk of tube blockage (20). Suctioning frequency should be tailored to the patient's needs; however, a standardized frequency of assessment is  recommended (12). Suctioning is recommended when there is evidence of visual or audible secretions in the airway and before and after each tracheostomy or inner cannula cleaning and/or change. The use of humidified oxygen is recommended to prevent mucosal dryness and development of thickened secretions (21). Shapiro et  al. established that a vital capacity (VC) at least 15 mL/kg is optimal for adequate secretion clearance. When the VC or cough reflex is diminished, patients may require more frequent suctioning (22). Overall, patients in the ICU tend to be physically deconditioned, and encouraging mobility and effective coughing can aid in secretion clearance.",

It is important to review the manufacturers' instructions for cleaning of the IC (12). Currently, there are no studies that have evaluated the optimal cleaning frequency of ICs. In general, it is recommended that the reusable IC be inspected and cleaned regularly, at least 3-times per day after initial tracheostomy placement.

It is usually related to the tracheostomy tube being positioned high in the airway, thus instead of sitting coaxially, the distal end is abutting the posterior tracheal wall. Tracheostomy tube malposition is reported in up to 10% of patients (40). Changing the tube to one with a longer internal length often corrects the problem and facilitates weaning from mechanical ventilation in 94% of reported cases (27). The importance of confirming optimal placement of the tracheostomy tube at the time of the initial procedure can decrease the risk for this complication. Thus, the use of bronchoscopy in PDT is strongly recommended to provide direct visualization of tube positioning (39)."

Predisposing factors include loose TT, neck edema, airway edema, excessive coughing, agitation, undersedation, morbid obesity, tracheostomy tube being too short for the tract, and downward traction from the weight of the ventilator circuit (12). Capnography wave changes can be an early indication of tube displacement (41). It takes approximately 7 days for the tracheostomy tract to mature; thus, the stoma will quickly collapse and close if  the  tube  is  displaced or accidentally removed before maturation. The quick collapse of the tissue planes makes the rate of unsuccessful simple replacement high, resulting in a high incidence of false replacement; thus, tracheostomy tube displacement is considered an airway emergency. If dislodgement is suspected, an attempt should be made to pass a suction catheter. If the catheter cannot be passed, then the tube has likely dislodged into a false passage. The tube should be removed, and the patient treated similarly to an accidental decannulation, with bag-mask ventilation and orotracheal intubation. After securing the airway, the tracheostomy can be replaced either percutaneously or surgically (42,43)."

The stoma and tube should be lubricated, and any secretions within the tube should be suctioned out. The balloon (if present) should be deflated. The tube is removed by direct gentle pulling with one hand while placing the second hand flat against the patient's abdomen for countertraction. The internal fixation device will deconform as it passes through the stoma. In some types of tubes, the internal fixation device is non-collapsible and will require endoscopic assistance for removal. The stoma site should be kept dry and covered. Patients are only allowed sips of water with no food for the first 4 hours after removal (46). On occasion, the stoma tract will not close, and a gastro-cutaneous fistula forms. A trial  of  thick  zinc  oxide  paste  to  the  opening  covered with pressure dressing could be tried before attempting invasive methods, including endoscopic clipping, suturing, plugging, and banding techniques. Surgical fistula closure is also an option (70)."

          "). Suctioning should be limited to the length of the tracheostomy tube. Excessive deep suctioning risks mucosal trauma, whereas inadequate suctioning increases risk of tube blockage (20). Suctioning frequency should be tailored to the patient's needs; however, a standardized frequency of assessment is  recommended (12). Suctioning is recommended when there is evidence of visual or audible secretions in the airway and before and after each tracheostomy or inner cannula cleaning and/or change. The use of humidified oxygen is recommended to prevent mucosal dryness and development of thickened secretions (21). Shapiro et  al. established that a vital capacity (VC) at least 15 mL/kg is optimal for adequate secretion clearance. When the VC or cough reflex is diminished, patients may require more frequent suctioning (22). Overall, patients in the ICU tend to be physically deconditioned, and encouraging mobility and effective coughing can aid in secretion clearance."

Predisposing factors include loose TT, neck edema, airway edema, excessive coughing, agitation, undersedation, morbid obesity, tracheostomy tube being too short for the tract, and downward traction from the weight of the ventilator circuit (12). Capnography wave changes can be an early indication of tube displacement (41). It takes approximately 7 days for the tracheostomy tract to mature; thus, the stoma will quickly collapse and close if  the  tube  is  displaced or accidentally removed before maturation. The quick collapse of the tissue planes makes the rate of unsuccessful simple replacement high, resulting in a high incidence of false replacement; thus, tracheostomy tube displacement is considered an airway emergency. If dislodgement is suspected, an attempt should be made to pass a suction catheter. If the catheter cannot be passed, then the tube has likely dislodged into a false passage. The tube should be removed, and the patient treated similarly to an accidental decannulation, with bag-mask ventilation and orotracheal intubation.

          "). Suctioning should be limited to the length of the tracheostomy tube. Excessive deep suctioning risks mucosal trauma, whereas inadequate suctioning increases risk of tube blockage (20). Suctioning frequency should be tailored to the patient's needs; however, a standardized frequency of assessment is  recommended (12). Suctioning is recommended when there is evidence of visual or audible secretions in the airway and before and after each tracheostomy or inner cannula cleaning and/or change. The use of humidified oxygen is recommended to prevent mucosal dryness and development of thickened secretions (21). Shapiro et  al. established that a vital capacity (VC) at least 15 mL/kg is optimal for adequate secretion clearance. When the VC or cough reflex is diminished, patients may require more frequent suctioning (22). Overall, patients in the ICU tend to be physically deconditioned, and encouraging mobility and effective coughing can aid in secretion clearance."

Predisposing factors include loose TT, neck edema, airway edema, excessive coughing, agitation, undersedation, morbid obesity, tracheostomy tube being too short for the tract, and downward traction from the weight of the ventilator circuit (12). Capnography wave changes can be an early indication of tube displacement (41). It takes approximately 7 days for the tracheostomy tract to mature; thus, the stoma will quickly collapse and close if  the  tube  is  displaced or accidentally removed before maturation. The quick collapse of the tissue planes makes the rate of unsuccessful simple replacement high, resulting in a high incidence of false replacement; thus, tracheostomy tube displacement is considered an airway emergency. If dislodgement is suspected, an attempt should be made to pass a suction catheter. If the catheter cannot be passed, then the tube has likely dislodged into a false passage. The tube should be removed, and the patient treated similarly to an accidental decannulation, with bag-mask ventilation and orotracheal intubation.
