With newer systems and updated software, the resolution is similar to conventional CT scanning. CBCT scans are obtained by taking a series of 480 X-ray images during a 180-degree rotational scan around the patient. Typical scans take between 4-10 seconds to perform. CBCT has been used extensively for percutaneous needle biopsies in the lung but more recently has been described in conjunction with bronchoscopy. Hohenforst-Schmidt et  al. (1)  reported a diagnostic yield of 70% in 33 patients with an average lesion size of 25 mm (1). Subsequently, Park et al. showed that in CBCT combined with bronchoscopy, the only factor associated with higher yield during transbronchial lung biopsy was CBCT confirmation of biopsy forceps positioning (2). A diagnostic yield of 71.2% was achieved in this study of 59 lesions with an average size of 31 mm."

The median size of lesions in this cohort was only 15 mm and the diagnostic yield was 87.7% (4). The yield for lesions 10 mm or less was 91.6% (11 of 12 lesions). Data on the full cohort of 93 lesions in 75 patients has been submitted for publication and shows an overall diagnostic yield of 93.5%. We acknowledge that these results are at a single center with a highly experienced user and may not be generalizable. Ongoing studies are in progress to determine if  the addition of CBCT to ENB will result in a similar increase in diagnostic yield."

This combination allows for the physician to select the lesion on the initial CBCT scan and it is then projected on standard fluoroscopy throughout the case in what is referred to as augmented fluoroscopy. The projected lesion is accurately projected during any rotation of the c-arm throughout the case. This allows for accurate localization of the lesion as well as real-time confirmation of biopsy tools ( Figure 1 ). Additionally, this allows for non-fluoroscopically visible lesions to now be visible. Most importantly, 3D real-time imaging is able to overcome CT-to-body divergence issues that plague current forms of navigational bronchoscopy. As the field advances toward the possibility of bronchoscopic ablation of peripheral tumors, real-time confirmation of probe positioning will be imperative.",

Nelson et al. showed that the use of tomosynthesis in combination with ENB in an animal model could help to eliminate the CT-to-body divergence issue that hinders ENB alone (7). Additionally, the tomosynthesis images were able to resolve 7 mm lesions that were not visible on standard fluoroscopy. The results of this study showed a significant correlation (coefficient 0.926) in position as measured with tomosynthesis compared to high resolution CT scan (HRCT).

A study by Yarmus et al. in  2016 involved the use of EMTTNA in a small cohort of 24 patients with an average lesion size of 20.3 mm (15) . These patients first had an attempted ENB with Veran's electromagnetic (EM) navigation system. ENB was diagnostic in only 33% of patients and the remaining patients underwent EMTTNA. The diagnostic yield of EMTTNA alone was 83%, however this was associated with a high pneumothorax rate of 21%. When all procedures were combined (ENB + Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) + EMTTNA) the diagnostic yield increased to 92% (58% of which were malignant, 42% considered benign). This technology offers the advantage of an all-in-one diagnostic procedure for those who feel comfortable performing their own TTNA procedure under virtual guidance only. Lesions that require a posterior approach are currently not able to utilize this technique. EMTTNA is a promising technology but may also be more difficult with lesions smaller than 2 cm as the technique lacks real-time confirmation of needle placement."

In several situations one technique is not enough for efficient diagnosis, therefore we investigated a new diagnostic technique of endobronchial guided biopsies by a Cone Beam Computertomography (CBCT) called DynaCT (SIEMENS AG Forchheim, Germany)."

The greatest weakness of ENB-based guidance is the registration divergence that exists between the planning CT, acquired days or weeks before the intervention, and the patient on the table on the day of the intervention. Augmenting ENB guidance with real-time tomosynthesis imaging during the intervention could mitigate the divergence and further improve the yield of ENB-guided transbronchial biopsies. The real-time tomosynthesis prototype, the scanning-beam digital x-ray (SBDX) system, does not currently display images reconstructed by the iterative algorithm that was developed for this lung imaging application. A protocol using fiducial markers was therefore implemented to permit evaluation of potential improvements that would be provided by the SBDX system in a clinical setting."

Here, we present our clinical experience with bronchoscopy-guided RFA under computed tomography (CT) monitoring for patients with peripheral-type non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Bronchoscopy-guided RFA was performed in two patients (80 and 70 years old) with NSCLC, who had no lymph node involvement and distant metastases (T1N0M0), but not indicated for surgery because of other complications, such as advanced age, poor pulmonary function, and refusal of thoracic surgery. The locations of the tumors were right S2 and left S3, respectively. Although the tumors showed ground-glass opacity (GGO) with solid components in both cases, radiographic findings changed to reduced mass-like shadow and remained stable for 4 and 3.5 years after bronchoscopy-guided RFA. As the former case developed progressive disease on chest CT, bronchoscopy-guided RFA was repeated in the same lesion, resulting in no change for the subsequent 1 year. There were no adverse reactions during the procedures. Thus, bronchoscopy-guided RFA is a safe and feasible procedure that represents a potentially useful therapeutic tool in local control in medically inoperable patients with stage I NSCLC."

Two patients with nonsurgical stage IA peripheral lung cancer and 1 with lung metastasis underwent treatment with flexible catheter RFA utilizing navigation bronchoscopy. Chest computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) were performed before and after RFA to assess the ablation response of the patients. One patient's tumor had no prior PET uptake and therefore no follow-up PET was obtained. The first and the third patient obtained partial response to RFA, and the second patient obtained complete response 3 months after RFA. The first patient developed progressive disease 6 months after RFA. The second and the third patient achieved one-year progression-free survival. No significant complications occurred in the 3 patients. Navigation bronchoscopy-guided RFA is a safe and feasible procedure for poor surgical candidates with stage IA lung cancer or lung metastasis."

A second study in humans with the BTPNA system involved six patients, of which 5 were able to have the procedure completed (10). The average lesion size was 19.8 mm and the procedure yielded a malignant diagnosis in all five cases. Pneumothorax was reported in 2 of the 5 patients (40%), 1 of which required a chest tube. Only one patient in both studies was able to have a successful transparenchymal biopsy of a lesion in the left upper lobe.
