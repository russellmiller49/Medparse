Normal tracheal diameter ranges from 16-20 millimeters (mm) and the length 10-14 centimeters (cm). The trachea has a unique 'D' shape on a cross-section with a flat membranous posterior wall and a cartilaginous anterior arch. The right main bronchus length is shorter than the left main bronchus (1.5 vs. 4.5 cm). This is due to the more proximal take off the right upper lobe in comparison to the left upper lobe. Both main bronchi range between 8-12 mm in diameter. As no two tracheobronchial trees are exactly alike, it is challenging to find a perfectly matching tracheobronchial stent when disease can alter all the dimensions differently."

            "text": "Management of diseases compromising the tracheobronchial tree is highly viable and predicated on several factors: local practice pattern, equipment availability, operator preference and experience, etc. Often, treatment mandates frequent airway evaluation with bronchoscopy and interventions to recapture the airway such as sequential balloon dilation, mechanical debulking, non-mechanical debulking with a variety of tools (thermal, laser, or cryotherapy-based ablation modalities), and stent placement for airway stabilization. The stent plays the role of airway maintenance to enable proper ventilation of the lung parenchyma beyond the stricture in malignant airway disease and to enable proper healing with minimization of the narrowed area of the airway in a benign airway disease. Stent matching of the malformed anatomy is critical to minimize the friction effect between the stent and the mucosa. Undue friction can to granulation tissue formation, and subsequent restenosis. Interventional pulmonologists have been facing complex airway disease and implanting various tracheobronchial stents for decades. In current practice, silicone and SEMS are the two main groups of airway prostheses. Both can achieve airway patency and maintain ventilation of the lung parenchyma for a time. Without a precise fit into the area, complications can arise with either type of stent: plugging with or without concurrent infection ( Figure 1 ),  metal fatigue leading to fracture ( Figure 2 ),  migration ( Figure 3 ),  formation of granulation tissue ( Figure 4 ),  and mucosal incorporation with possible erosion and perforation ( Figure 5 )  (7).",

        "abstract": "Stents and tubes to maintain the patency of the airways are commonly used for malignant obstruction and are occasionally employed in benign disease. Malignant airway obstruction usually results from direct involvement of bronchogenic carcinoma, or by extension of carcinomas occurring in the esophagus or the thyroid. External compression from lymph nodes or metastatic disease from other organs can also cause central airway obstruction. Most malignant airway lesions are surgically inoperable due to advanced disease stage and require multimodality palliation, including stent placement. As with any other medical device, stents have significantly evolved over the last 50 years and deserve an in-depth understanding of their true capabilities and complications. Not every silicone stent is created equal and the same holds for metallic stents. Herein, we present an overview of the topic as well as some of the more practical and controversial issues surrounding airway stents. We also try to dispel the myths surrounding stent removal and their supposed use only in central airways. At the end, we come to the long-held conclusion that stents should not be used as first line treatment of choice, but after ruling out the possibility of curative surgical resection or repair."

        "abstract": "The cardiovascular research and clinical communities are ideally positioned to address the epidemic of noncommunicable causes of death, as well as advance our understanding of human health and disease, through the development and implementation of precision medicine. New tools will be needed for describing the cardiovascular health status of individuals and populations, including 'omic' data, exposome and social determinants of health, the microbiome, behaviours and motivations, patient-generated data, and the array of data in electronic medical records. Cardiovascular specialists can build on their experience and use precision medicine to facilitate discovery science and improve the efficiency of clinical research, with the goal of providing more precise information to improve the health of individuals and populations. Overcoming the barriers to implementing precision medicine will require addressing a range of technical and sociopolitical issues. Health care under precision medicine will become a more integrated, dynamic system, in which patients are no longer a passive entity on whom measurements are made, but instead are central stakeholders who contribute data and participate actively in shared decision-making. Many traditionally defined diseases have common mechanisms; therefore, elimination of a siloed approach to medicine will ultimately pave the path to the creation of a universal precision medicine environment."

        "abstract": "Three major problems are currently associated with airway stents: mucostasis, formation of granulation tissue, and migration. We wanted to determine whether these problems could be solved by a different stent design. Based on theoretical considerations of an idealized trachea, we developed a dynamic bifurcation stent made of silicone which incorporates horseshoe-shaped steel struts. A flexible posterior membrane enables dynamic compression during cough, whilst the clasps maintain the airway lumen in the face of external compression. The design of the stent cast was based upon computed tomographic (CT)-scan studies of the central airways. Its complex shape provides a smoother distribution of pressure on the mucosa; thereby, lowering the stimulus for granulation formation. The bronchial limbs saddle on the carina, preventing displacement. The mechanical behaviours of the new stent and two commercially available stents were compared in an ex-vivo model, utilizing freshly excised tracheae and new visualization techniques. Dynamic (artificial coughs) and static loads (simulating tumour compression or pleural pressures) were applied on excised human tracheae with different stents. Our dynamic stent preserved effective compression of the posterior membrane in response to cough, and also provided lumen stability against extrinsic compression. In comparison, the two commercially available stents did not provide both functions equally well. In conclusion, our newly designed dynamic bifurcation stent shows characteristics which should prove useful in avoiding problems currently associated with airway stents."

        "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) printing, or additive manufacturing, technology has rapidly penetrated the medical device industry over the past several years, and innovative groups have harnessed it to create devices with unique composition, structure, and customizability. These distinctive capabilities afforded by 3D printing have introduced new regulatory challenges. The customizability of 3D-printed devices introduces new complexities when drafting a design control model for FDA consideration of market approval. The customizability and unique build processes of 3D-printed medical devices pose unique challenges in meeting regulatory standards related to the manufacturing quality assurance. Consistent material powder properties and optimal printing parameters such as build orientation and laser power must be addressed and communicated to the FDA to ensure a quality build. Postprinting considerations unique to 3D-printed devices, such as cleaning, finishing and sterilization are also discussed. In this manuscript we illustrate how such regulatory hurdles can be navigated by discussing our experience with our group's 3D-printed bioresorbable implantable device."

Airway stent placement can result in complications due to a variety of factors, including poor fit of the stent in the airway. We report the 1-year outcome of 2 patients with airway disease caused by granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) affecting the left main bronchus and secondary carina. These patients had not responded to systemic therapy or standard bronchoscopic techniques and had complications with commercially available airway stents. We describe a first-in-human, clinical experience to address these issues. Using computed tomography (CT) imaging and 3D printing technology, we generated and implanted patient-specific silicone airway stents to address airway disease. 3D patient-specific stent prescription was created using a CT scan of the patient's chest and a proprietary software package originally developed for orthopedic surgical planning. Silicone stents were manufactured and implanted. Observation for &gt; 1 year after implantation compared to the 6 months prior to patient-specific stent implant were compared for the number, clinically required stent changes, procedure time, and general clinical improvement per usual standard of care after airway stenting. Patients showed improved durability, a shorter procedure time, and improvement of patient-reported symptoms leading to a reduced need for stent changes and modifications. The use of 3D printing technology to make patient-specific silicone stents is feasible with early clinical proof of concept noting a durable improvement over 1 year of follow-up."

        "abstract": "Stent placement has been established as a standard procedure for treating airway obstructions. Other indications are localized malacias and fistulas. Though many different stents with various diameters and lengths are available, the shapes are hardly ever ideal because of the distorted anatomy in patients with diseased airways. There are technical and legal limitations for customizing purchased airway stents. Individually tailored stents would be preferable. New techniques of additive manufacturing such as 3D printing make it possible to produce optimized stents for a particular patient. Using CT data and bronchoscopic images, stents can be constructed that match a particular anatomical situation and apply the optimized expansion force. We give an overview of the currently available manufacturing techniques for polymeric stents and report about our own experience. Direct on-site printing of polyurethane stents in a hospital and printing individual extrusion molds for silicone stents in a certified cleanroom are both feasible. Furthermore, there are promising attempts of combining mechanically customized stents with surface modifications, drug-eluting features, biodegradability, and time-dependent adaptation (4D printing). Truly optimized airway stents with the potential of solving the well-known stent problems such as granulation tissue formation, remodeling, mucostasis, and infections are in reach. The technical hurdles are probably easier to overcome than the legal constraints. The legal situations are discussed from a physician's and a manufacturer's perspective."

        "abstract": "Coronary drug-eluting stents (DES) are a breakthrough technology that has changed the standard of care for many patients undergoing percutaneous intervention for coronary artery disease. Initial trials of two DES demonstrated significant clinical benefit with respect to the need for reintervention when compared with bare metal stents. However, more recent studies of DES involve in-patients with more complex disease, such as bifurcation lesions, chronic total occlusions and multiple-vessel disease. Additionally, DES are now being evaluated in patients previously only considered for surgical intervention. Assessment of DES in these complicated patient populations can lead to challenges in trial design, but the US FDA is willing to consider alternative clinical trial designs and statistical analysis plans. Other complex issues associated with DES include duration of clinical trials to determine safety, and the appropriate dose and duration of concomitant antiplatelet therapy. Finally, the FDA acknowledges that DES are complex products to produce and we believe that through interaction with the FDA during development, difficulties with test methodologies, animal studies and clinical trial designs can be addressed. The future of DES likely involves new stent and carrier materials, including biodegradable materials and new drugs and biologicals. The FDA anticipates continued collaboration with physicians, manufacturers, academic institutions and professional societies."

        "abstract": "Because of the increasing incidence of coronary artery disease, the importance of cardiovascular stents has continuously increased as a treatment of this disease. Biodegradable scaffolds fabricated from polymers and metals have emerged as promising materials for vascular stents because of their biodegradability. Although such stent framework materials have shown good clinical efficacy, it is difficult to decide whether polymers or metals are better vascular scaffolds because their properties are different. Therefore, there are still obstacles in the development of biodegradable vascular scaffolds in terms of improving clinical efficacy. This review analyzes the pros and cons of current stent materials with respect to five key factors for next-generation stent and discusses methods of improvement. Furthermore, we discuss biodegradable electronic stents with electrical conductivity, which has been considered unimportant until now, and highlight electrical conductivity as a key factor in the development of next-generation stents."
