Seventy-one patients (72%) who underwent PDT were receiving therapeutic anticoagulation drugs; 5 of those patients (5.1%) had bleeding within the /uniFB01 rst 48 hours of the procedure that required bedside packing around the tracheostomy, with 1 patient requiring surgical management. Another potential bene /uniFB01 t of tracheostomies is the decreased incidence of tracheal stenosis in the subglottic space. 11 Two patients already had granulation tissue and subglottic stenosis at the time of bronchoscopy. After discharge from the ICU, all patients are followed by speech pathology and otolaryngology for /uniFB01 nal decannulation and independent evaluation of long-term complications."

There was no conversion rate in the four providers (50%) who agreed to testing, and no providers have had any symptoms develop or have missed any work days. All providers wore standard personal protection equipment. We decreased the number of health care providers in the room to three team members, minimized the amount of time with an open-air system to a few seconds, and had no time with active ventilation and aerosolization during the open-air system.

We also demonstrate a high success rate in performing this novel technique, with safe patient and health care provider outcomes and minimal postprocedural complications. In addition, this study is the /uniFB01 rst to demonstrate how to perform a PDT that mitigates the aerosolization of SARSCoV-2 during the procedure. Most important, the early outcomes reported support that tracheostomies are bene /uniFB01 cial for these patients and that PDT can be safely performed with low health care worker exposure to the virus. There are several /uniFB02 aws, however, including the short duration of this initial report, with only early outcomes being available with an average follow-up of 18 days after starting mechanical ventilation. Also, not all health care workers providers involved both in the procedure and in the postprocedure care have been tested by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or SARSCoV-2 antibodies, and a certain percent of COVID-19 infected people are asymptomatic; however, it is impossible to determine the value of a positive test, as daily testing was not feasible and the continuous high level of exposure during the 5 weeks of providing critical care to COVID-19 patients outside the PDT procedures."

The technique is described in detail and is easy to perform. This study supports that, at early review, both can be achieved. On a larger scale, the earlier weaning from mechanical ventilation may increase the number of available ICU beds and ventilators needed to adequately treat the large demands from these COVID19 patients. Further follow-up studies on this cohort will evaluate late outcomes of this technique and evaluate its ef /uniFB01 cacy and value in patients with COVID-19."

Forty patients (41%) remain on full ventilator support, and 19 (19%) are weaning from mechanical ventilation. Seven patients (7%) died as a result of respiratory and multiorgan failure.

The needle and catheter were inserted into the airway under direct visualization (Figure 1d). The guidewire was threaded into the airway and directed caudally (Figure 1e). A super /uniFB01 cial, small (0.5 cm) skin incision was made after the wire was in place. The track was dilated with a short dilator, then with the Ciaglia Blue Rhino (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN) dilator (Figure 1f). Before insertion of the tracheostomy tube, the ventilator was put on standby mode again, and the ETT cuff was de /uniFB02 ated. The ETT was withdrawn under direct visualization until it was proximal to the tracheostomy site. A percutaneous tracheostomy tube (Shiley /uniFB02 exible tracheostomy tube 8.5; Covidien, Dublin, Ireland) was inserted into the trachea, the cuff was in /uniFB02 ated, and the bronchoscope was advanced through the tracheostomy tube to con /uniFB01 rm position and to remove any blood or secretions from the airway.

          "racheostomy may reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation requirement and lead to shorter ICU stays. 10,11 The placement of a tracheostomy enables better management of secretions due to easier suctioning and the ability to change the inner cannula. That is a major bene /uniFB01 t for patients with COVID-19. Owing to improved comfort, patients with tracheostomy can be weaned from heavy sedation, 5 which has the added bene /uniFB01 t of decreased use of the paralytic agents and sedatives that were required in more than 56% of these patients. Moreover, patients with a tracheostomy undergoing ventilator support weaning are more easily able to participate in respiratory therapy, physical therapy, and to sit in a chair, contributing to faster recovery. Although there was a 7% mortality rate, this early mortality report is signi /uniFB01 cantly lower than the 50% to 67% reported in the literature on COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical respiratory support. 4-6 This /uniFB01 nding re /uniFB02 ects that our inclusion criteria selected the patients with the highest potential bene /uniFB01 t from an early tracheostomy and survival.
