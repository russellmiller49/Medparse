    "abstract": "FB aspiration is an uncommon event among adults; but is associated with significant morbidity and rarely, even mortality. Early identification and removal of FB is important to prevent associated complications. Flexible bronchoscopy remains mainstay for FB removal among adults but rigid bronchoscopy may be required in select circumstances. The use of interventional bronchoscopic techniques for FB removal requires specialized training and experience that may not be available at all centers. Each case of FB aspiration poses a different challenge and ingenuity is often required for successful removal of FB from the tracheobronchial tree. A team-based approach on part of interventional pulmonology or intensivist, anesthesiology and thoracic surgery is likely to improve the success of these procedures for optimal outcomes.

Patients may present with acute onset cough, chest pain, breathlessness or sub-acutely with unexplained hemoptysis, non-resolving pneumonia and at times, as an incidental finding on imaging. Patients with iatrogenic FB such as an aspirated broken tooth during difficult intubation or a broken instrument are more common scenarios in the intensive care unit (ICU). Patients with post-obstructive pneumonia with or without sepsis, or variable degree of hemoptysis often require ICU level of care and bronchoscopic interventions. Rigid bronchoscopy has traditionally been the modality of choice; however, with the innovation in instrumentation and wider availability of flexible bronchoscopes, most of the FB removal is now successfully performed using flexible bronchoscopy. Proceduralists choose instruments in accordance with their training and expertise. We describe the use of most common instruments including forceps, balloon catheters, and baskets. Role of cryoprobe and LASER in FB removal is reviewed as well. In general, larger working channel bronchoscopes are preferred; however, smaller working channel bronchoscopes may be used in situations when the patients are intubated with a smaller diameter endotracheal or tracheostomy tubes. Large size FB are removed en bloc with the grasping tool, bronchoscope, and endotracheal or tracheostomy tube, requiring preparation to safely re-establish the airway. After FB removal, bronchoscopy is re-performed to identify any residual FB, assess any injury to the airway, suction post-obstructive secretions or pus, control any active bleeding and remove granulation tissue that may be obstructing the airway. Additional interventions like balloon dilatation may be required to dislodge an impacted FB or to maintain patency of bronchial lumen. If bronchoscopic methods fail, surgery may be required for retrieval of FB in symptomatic patients or to resect suppurative or necrotizing lung process. Multidisciplinary approach involving intensivists, surgeons, and anesthesiologists is the key to optimal patient outcomes."

Advancement in technology and introduction of flexible bronchoscopy has made it easier to achieve similar results as rigid bronchoscopy in most situations and as such, it is now the preferred approach for FB extraction (3-5). Even so, rigid bronchoscopy holds its utility in select situations, especially in children (4)."

Due to relatively small diameter of the tracheobronchial tree, FB gets lodged in the proximal airways in children resulting in stridor and acute respiratory distress. However, adults usually present with symptoms resulting from distal impaction of the FB. It is more common for a FB to get impacted in the right bronchial tree due to the straighter alignment of the right mainstem with trachea compared to left. Among adults, most studies show high incidence of FB aspiration in the 45-60 year age group (5-7). Often, adult patients have predisposing risk factors for aspiration, which may include altered mental status, alcohol or drug intoxication, neuromuscular weakness. In certain cases, FB aspiration can also be iatrogenic."

Postobstructive necrotizing pneumonia secondary to FB aspiration may cause hypoxic respiratory failure and some patients may require ventilator support ( Figure 1 ). Rarely, patients may present post-cardiopulmonary arrest after a 'choking' episode due to FB aspiration (20,21). In intubated patients, endotracheal tube (ETT) obstruction due to aspirated FB may result in worsening hypoxia and difficulty with oxygenation and ventilation (22,23). The obstruction may be secondary to an aspirated FB or iatrogenic as a result of traumatic intubation, for example, a broken tooth. It is critical to promptly recognize ETT obstruction. Activation of high-pressure alarm on the ventilator, reduced tidal volume delivered, reduced expired end-tidal CO2 ,  severe hypoxemia and inability to pass the suction catheter down the ETT; all may provide clues to the intensivist (23). Diagnostic bronchoscopy is valuable in  these  circumstances to both diagnose the cause of obstruction and if due to FB, mechanically dislodge the FB outside the ETT into the tracheobronchial tree. The FB is then removed using the tools and techniques discussed in latter sections. Alternatively, consideration may be given to exchange of ETT especially if the FB is firmly lodged in the lumen of ETT.",

A short contact of iron pill to the surrounding mucosa is known to cause local erythema and irritation. If the pill is not removed promptly, it results in ulceration of the bronchial mucosa, tissue necrosis and as a result of abnormal repair, symptomatic bronchial stenosis. Caterino et al. published a three patient case series of patients with iron pill inhalation. The authors were able to remove the iron pill with interventional bronchoscopy in two patients. The third patient required pulmonary bilobectomy after a failed bronchial stent placement (78). Chu et al. also described a case of iron pill aspiration causing obliterative bronchiolitis where multiple bronchoscopies, cryotherapy and balloon dilation were performed to relieve bronchial stenosis. However, these attempts were not completely successful and the patient remained symptomatic (79). Highindex of suspicion and prompt removal of aspirated iron pills may reduce risk of delayed complications."

A preprocedure CT angiogram may help evaluate risk of lifethreatening bleeding during removal of the long-standing impacted FB. Bronchial artery embolization may be performed if anomalous blood supply is noted to the area. Multi-disciplinary approach to FB removal including an early thoracic surgery consultation is encouraged in these circumstances.",

In United States, training in  bronchoscopic airway FB extraction falls within the scope of Interventional Pulmonology (IP). IP is a  relatively  young  field  and  it  is  only  recently,  that accreditation standards for list of procedures that training programs are mandated to offer during IP fellowship were published (81). Even so, specialized training in the removal of airway FBs may be limited during these fellowships due to a variety of reasons including: the overall low incidence of FB aspiration and the steep learning curve of gaining expertise in these advanced procedures. In a systematic review, Sehgal et al. reported that only 1 in 400 bronchoscopies were performed for FB extraction over a period of more than three decades (13). In  such  a  scenario,  the  use  of  simulation  techniques is  very  helpful for training and skill development (82) ( Video 1 ).  Simulation based procedural training has been demonstrated to improve the learning curve and selfreported confidence among trainees (83). With the expected growth of IP fellowship programs in the US and worldwide, the utilization of simulation tools in the training of IP physicians and proceduralists is imperative."

            "text": "FB aspiration is an uncommon event among adults; but is  associated with significant morbidity and rarely, even mortality. Early identification and removal of FB is important to prevent associated complications. Flexible bronchoscopy remains mainstay for FB removal among adults but rigid bronchoscopy may be required in select circumstances. The use of interventional bronchoscopic techniques for FB removal requires specialized training and experience that may not be available at all centers. Each case of FB aspiration poses a different challenge and ingenuity is  often required for successful removal of FB from the tracheobronchial tree. A team-based approach on part of interventional pulmonology or intensivist, anesthesiology and thoracic surgery is likely to improve the success of these procedures for optimal outcomes."

They found that rigid bronchoscopy was preferred in patients with no comorbidities, previous failed attempt to remove FB, a longer duration of aspiration and FB of hard consistency (28) ( Figure 5 ).  In  the latter situation, rigid bronchoscopy is particularly preferred as rigid instruments allow better transfer and control of force in extracting hard and impacted foreign bodies. Also, it allows access to larger suction as significant bleeding may occur with manipulation during extraction of impacted FB, particularly the ones lodged in airway for longer duration.",

Fogarty catheters have also been used to extract FBs which have a central lumen where the catheter could be inserted through the central lumen (56-60).

Foreign bodies that contain high water content for freezing and adhering to the cryoprobe, and that are difficult to remove with grasping forceps are ideally suited for removal by cryoprobe such as meat, pills, peanuts, teeth and bones.

Unlike other applications like cryobiopsy where cryogenic effect is activated for a pre-determined time cycle, for FB removal the duration of activation is guided by video input. The operator has to freeze enough volume for a good grasp; however, caution is to be observed so that the adjoining mucosa does not form a part of the crystal. If it does, then the cryoprobe has to be thawed in situ and reattempt made by activating the cryogen for reduced time duration. The probe along with the FB is then pulled out of the airway.

          "). Rarely, patients may present post-cardiopulmonary arrest after a 'choking' episode due to FB aspiration (20,21). In intubated patients, endotracheal tube (ETT) obstruction due to aspirated FB may result in worsening hypoxia and difficulty with oxygenation and ventilation (22,23). The obstruction may be secondary to an aspirated FB or iatrogenic as a result of traumatic intubation, for example, a broken tooth. It is critical to promptly recognize ETT obstruction. Activation of high-pressure alarm on the ventilator, reduced tidal volume delivered, reduced expired end-tidal CO2 ,  severe hypoxemia and inability to pass the suction catheter down the ETT; all may provide clues to the intensivist (23). Diagnostic bronchoscopy is valuable in  these  circumstances to both diagnose the cause of obstruction and if due to FB, mechanically dislodge the FB outside the ETT into the tracheobronchial tree. The FB is then removed using the tools and techniques discussed in latter sections. Alternatively, consideration may be given to exchange of ETT especially if the FB is firmly lodged in the lumen of ETT."

In intubated patients, endotracheal tube (ETT) obstruction due to aspirated FB may result in worsening hypoxia and difficulty with oxygenation and ventilation (22,23). The obstruction may be secondary to an aspirated FB or iatrogenic as a result of traumatic intubation, for example, a broken tooth. It is critical to promptly recognize ETT obstruction. Activation of high-pressure alarm on the ventilator, reduced tidal volume delivered, reduced expired end-tidal CO2 ,  severe hypoxemia and inability to pass the suction catheter down the ETT; all may provide clues to the intensivist (23). Diagnostic bronchoscopy is valuable in  these  circumstances to both diagnose the cause of obstruction and if due to FB, mechanically dislodge the FB outside the ETT into the tracheobronchial tree.

In intubated patients, endotracheal tube (ETT) obstruction due to aspirated FB may result in worsening hypoxia and difficulty with oxygenation and ventilation (22,23). The obstruction may be secondary to an aspirated FB or iatrogenic as a result of traumatic intubation, for example, a broken tooth. It is critical to promptly recognize ETT obstruction. Activation of high-pressure alarm on the ventilator, reduced tidal volume delivered, reduced expired end-tidal CO2 ,  severe hypoxemia and inability to pass the suction catheter down the ETT; all may provide clues to the intensivist (23). Diagnostic bronchoscopy is valuable in  these  circumstances to both diagnose the cause of obstruction and if due to FB, mechanically dislodge the FB outside the ETT into the tracheobronchial tree. The FB is then removed using the tools and techniques discussed in latter sections. Alternatively, consideration may be given to exchange of ETT especially if the FB is firmly lodged in the lumen of ETT."

          "). Rarely, patients may present post-cardiopulmonary arrest after a 'choking' episode due to FB aspiration (20,21). In intubated patients, endotracheal tube (ETT) obstruction due to aspirated FB may result in worsening hypoxia and difficulty with oxygenation and ventilation (22,23). The obstruction may be secondary to an aspirated FB or iatrogenic as a result of traumatic intubation, for example, a broken tooth. It is critical to promptly recognize ETT obstruction. Activation of high-pressure alarm on the ventilator, reduced tidal volume delivered, reduced expired end-tidal CO2 ,  severe hypoxemia and inability to pass the suction catheter down the ETT; all may provide clues to the intensivist (23). Diagnostic bronchoscopy is valuable in  these  circumstances to both diagnose the cause of obstruction and if due to FB, mechanically dislodge the FB outside the ETT into the tracheobronchial tree. The FB is then removed using the tools and techniques discussed in latter sections. Alternatively, consideration may be given to exchange of ETT especially if the FB is firmly lodged in the lumen of ETT."

          "). Rarely, patients may present post-cardiopulmonary arrest after a 'choking' episode due to FB aspiration (20,21). In intubated patients, endotracheal tube (ETT) obstruction due to aspirated FB may result in worsening hypoxia and difficulty with oxygenation and ventilation (22,23). The obstruction may be secondary to an aspirated FB or iatrogenic as a result of traumatic intubation, for example, a broken tooth. It is critical to promptly recognize ETT obstruction. Activation of high-pressure alarm on the ventilator, reduced tidal volume delivered, reduced expired end-tidal CO2 ,  severe hypoxemia and inability to pass the suction catheter down the ETT; all may provide clues to the intensivist (23). Diagnostic bronchoscopy is valuable in  these  circumstances to both diagnose the cause of obstruction and if due to FB, mechanically dislodge the FB outside the ETT into the tracheobronchial tree. The FB is then removed using the tools and techniques discussed in latter sections.

          "). Rarely, patients may present post-cardiopulmonary arrest after a 'choking' episode due to FB aspiration (20,21). In intubated patients, endotracheal tube (ETT) obstruction due to aspirated FB may result in worsening hypoxia and difficulty with oxygenation and ventilation (22,23). The obstruction may be secondary to an aspirated FB or iatrogenic as a result of traumatic intubation, for example, a broken tooth. It is critical to promptly recognize ETT obstruction. Activation of high-pressure alarm on the ventilator, reduced tidal volume delivered, reduced expired end-tidal CO2 ,  severe hypoxemia and inability to pass the suction catheter down the ETT; all may provide clues to the intensivist (23). Diagnostic bronchoscopy is valuable in  these  circumstances to both diagnose the cause of obstruction and if due to FB, mechanically dislodge the FB outside the ETT into the tracheobronchial tree. The FB is then removed using the tools and techniques discussed in latter sections. Alternatively, consideration may be given to exchange of ETT especially if the FB is firmly lodged in the lumen of ETT."
