We sought to evaluate the current practice patterns in the management of exudative pleural effusion in the interventional pulmonary (IP) community.\nMethods: A questionnaire was developed and was disseminated to all listed American Association of Bronchology and Interventional Pulmonology (AABIP) members. Survey addressed the approach to the management of recurrent exudative pleural effusions with emphasis on the roles of Semi-rigid and rigid thoracoscopy.\nResults: Of 388 members who opened the survey, 165 (43%) completed it. The majority were interventional pulmonologists representing academic and private practice in the United States (US), with approximately one third of respondents from other countries. Almost two thirds (61%) of them perform thoracoscopy. For those who do perform thoracoscopy, 93% would perform thoracoscopy for recurrent undiagnosed exudate. Equal numbers perform rigid and semi-rigid thoracoscopy and 31 (44%) perform both procedures, there was no statistically significant difference. There was a slight preference for Semirigid thoracoscopy although opinion was skewed slightly in favor of rigid thoracoscopy when asked about diagnostic yield. TPCs play a large role in management patterns, sometimes without and sometimes after thoracoscopy, 59% of the respondents chose a TPC alone for the management of known malignant effusion, while a 16% would combine it with MT (P value <0.0001).\nConclusions: Thoracoscopy is accepted as the diagnostic procedure of choice for undiagnosed exudative effusion.

The questions addressed practitioner demographics, practice types and locations, perceptions with respect to rigid versus Semi-rigid thoracoscopy (also known as flexible or semi-flexible thoracoscope), and the clinical approach to recurrent exudative and malignant effusions. The survey was closed in September, 2017 and the results were tabulated. Some respondents completed only a portion of the survey. For this reason, results are reported as percent of responses to each question and not as absolute numbers, as the absolute numbers don't contain the relevant denominators. Also, each response was rounded to the nearest percent, and for this reason the summed responses to a question may not always total 100%. The survey also provided avenue for the respondents to elaborate on their response; these were tabulated and included in the results. Student t tests were used when appropriate to compare the responses."

The latter should be a factor of decreasing impact, as current criteria for training in IP through the fellowship process include thoracoscopy. The former is more problematic; the ideal IP program works in partnership with subspecialties including thoracic surgery, head and neck surgery, radiation oncology, and thoracic oncology. Political/financial barriers imposed by other subspecialties are unfortunate, as they impair both the relationship with that subspecialty and the capacity of IP physicians to practice the full range of accredited competence."

In addition, pragmatic aspects of scheduling thoracoscopy may impact clinical decisions. The morbidity of thoracoscopy is very low (<0.01%) (2,3), and the authors support the argument that thoracoscopy is a reasonable second procedure because of (I) its dramatically higher diagnostic yield (than a second thoracentesis) both for cancer and for other diagnoses such as tuberculous pleurisy; and (II) the opportunity to initiate pleurodesis when indicated."

On the other hand, if semi-rigid thoracoscopy is  performed in the endoscopy suite, the overall cost of the procedure is reduced). Biopsies with the Semi-rigid thoracoscope tend to be smaller than those with rigid, with cryoprobe partially bridging the gap between biopsies with rigid instruments and those obtained with Semi-rigid biopsy forceps (6,7).

For recurrent effusion known to be benign, only 41% favored TPC as the intervention of choice. Fifty-one percent would perform thoracoscopy, but a majority (51%) of those performing thoracoscopy would place a TPC at the end of the procedure.

New graduates may need to be cognizant of the potential reception by the thoracic surgeons at the site of their first IP employment. TPC is increasingly the mainstay of management of recurrent exudative effusion, and current practice patterns indicate a widespread integration of thoracoscopy with TPC in management strategies."

        "to": "Background: With increased availability of techniques to address pleural effusions including medical thoracoscopy (MT) and tunneled pleural catheter (TPC), we anticipate there has been an evolution in the practice pattern. We sought to evaluate the current practice patterns in the management of exudative pleural effusion in the interventional pulmonary (IP) community.\nMethods: A questionnaire was developed and was disseminated to all listed American Association of Bronchology and Interventional Pulmonology (AABIP) members. Survey addressed the approach to the management of recurrent exudative pleural effusions with emphasis on the roles of Semi-rigid and rigid thoracoscopy.\nResults: Of 388 members who opened the survey, 165 (43%) completed it. The majority were interventional pulmonologists representing academic and private practice in the United States (US), with approximately one third of respondents from other countries. Almost two thirds (61%) of them perform thoracoscopy. For those who do perform thoracoscopy, 93% would perform thoracoscopy for recurrent undiagnosed exudate. Equal numbers perform rigid and semi-rigid thoracoscopy and 31 (44%) perform both procedures, there was no statistically significant difference. There was a slight preference for Semirigid thoracoscopy although opinion was skewed slightly in favor of rigid thoracoscopy when asked about diagnostic yield. TPCs play a large role in management patterns, sometimes without and sometimes after thoracoscopy, 59% of the respondents chose a TPC alone for the management of known malignant effusion, while a 16% would combine it with MT (P value <0.0001).\nConclusions: Thoracoscopy is accepted as the diagnostic procedure of choice for undiagnosed exudative effusion. TPCs play a dominant role in management even when thoracoscopy is performed.",

Thus, it is considerably less invasive and less expensive. The main diagnostic and therapeutic indications for medical thoracoscopy are pleural effusions and pneumothorax. Due to its high diagnostic accuracy, approaching almost 100% in malignant and tuberculous pleural effusions, it should be used when pleural fluid analysis and needle biopsy are nondiagnostic. In addition, medical thoracoscopy provides staging for lung cancer and diffuse malignant mesothelioma. Talc poudrage, as the best conservative method for pleurodesis in 1998, can also be performed with medical thoracoscopy. It can also be effectively used in the early management of empyema. In spontaneous pneumothorax it allows staging, thereby facilitating treatment decisions, and in addition coagulation of eventual blebs and talc poudrage for efficient pleurodesis. Medical thoracoscopy is a safe procedure which is even easier to learn than flexible bronchoscopy. Due to its high diagnostic and therapeutic efficiency, it should be applied increasingly in the management of the above-mentioned pleuropulmonary diseases."

The latter allow greater access within the pleural cavity but are difficult to manipulate. The Olympus LTF semiflexible fiberoptic thoracoscope combines features of both instruments, having a solid body and a flexible terminal section. In the first study with this instrument, we evaluated ease of use and compared diagnostic yield with closed needle biopsy."
