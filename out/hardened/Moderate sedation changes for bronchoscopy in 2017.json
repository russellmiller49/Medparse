Due to the increasing use of anesthesia services to provide moderate sedation during endoscopy, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services made the decision to remove work relative value units from many of the services requiring moderate sedation, including the bronchoscopy codes. If a bronchoscopist provides moderate sedation to a patient without using anesthesia services or another quali /uniFB01 ed provider, that work (and revenue) can be reclaimed by using the relevant codes. An understanding of the recent changes in coding and billing is essential for appropriate reimbursement. CHEST2017; 152(4):893-897"

Although this approach has certainly improved patient tolerance of the procedure, it has complicated the physician coding and billing practices."

' 5 Prior to 1998, there were no speci /uniFB01 c codes for sedation services provided by bronchoscopists, and services were coded by using anesthesia codes or were left uncoded and therefore unreimbursed. Moderate sedation codes were added to the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code set in 1998. These codes were as follows: 99141, sedation with or without analgesia (conscious sedation), intravenous, intramuscular, or inhalation; or 99142, sedation with or without analgesia (conscious sedation), oral, rectal, and/or intranasal. One of these two CPT codes was then used to bill for moderate sedation given during a bronchoscopic procedure."

These codes were placed into a new CPT appendix, Appendix G, which included a list of procedures in which moderate sedation is considered an inherent part of the procedure. In the CPT manual, codes that were listed in Appendix G were annotated with a bulls-eye symbol ( 1 ) next to the code. At the same time, additional codes were created (9914399150), which could be used to code for moderate sedation provided to patients undergoing procedures that were not listed in Appendix G of the CPT. The use of the codes 99143 to 99145 by the operating physician also required the presence of an independent trained observer to assist the physician in monitoring the patient ' s level of consciousness and physiological status. A Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) transmittal that clari /uniFB01 ed use of these new codes did identify a potential problem in delivery of moderate sedation: ' In the unusual [emphasis added] event when a second physician other than the health care professional performing the diagnostic or therapeutic services provides moderation sedation in the facility setting for the procedures listed in Appendix G, the second physician can bill 99148 to 99150.

The use of these agents, therefore, became much more common in clinical practice. However, it was often challenging for the operating physician to both perform the procedure and to appropriately titrate these shorter acting agents. Practice patterns changed so that an additional clinician, often an anesthetist, would provide moderate sedation while the operating physician performed the procedure. Because the number of GI procedures performed yearly surpasses all other specialty procedures, it is not surprising that literature dating even before 2006 did suggest changes in practice patterns for GI endoscopy. 7 In 2010, it was predicted that by 2015, > 50% of GI procedures would be performed with anesthesia services providing moderate sedation rather than the operating physician. 8"

The CPT editorial panel altered and renumbered the CPT codes designed to separately report moderate sedation services. The list of new codes is presented in Table 1. At the same time, Appendix G and the bulls-eye symbol were eliminated from the CPT manual. The Relative Value Scale Update Committee (RUC) devised a method for revaluing the codes into two groups based on the complexity of the patient, although this method was eventually not accepted by CMS.",

Following the survey, a work relative value unit (wRVU) of 0.25 was proposed by the RUC for CPT code 99152, which was accepted by CMS and published in the CY 2017 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Final Rule (CY 2017 Final Rule). 11 The valuation of CPT code 99152 was the most important for procedural specialists because its value would determine how much work would be subtracted from the procedure codes listed in Appendix G. Interestingly, the survey data provided by the GI societies differed from other societies in that there was a bimodal distribution in the data from the respondents performing GI endoscopy. Their survey data revealed that one group of respondents determined a wRVU of 0.10 was appropriate, while a second group determined that a wRVU of 0.25 was appropriate, for provision of moderate sedation for GI procedures. Based on this information, CMS decided that a wRVU of 0.10 was more accurate for GI procedures and made a speci /uniFB01 c Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (G0500) for reporting GI endoscopy procedures other than biliary procedures.

        "abstract": "The objective of this study was to determine if flexible FOB could be performed safely without premedication other than topical anesthesia. A total of 281 procedures performed during a 12-month period at a VA medical center were reviewed. Ninety-one procedures performed without premedication were compared with 190 procedures performed with premedication. Complications occurred in 5 percent of patients in each group. Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences in age, spirometry, P(A-a)O2 or SaO2 between both groups. Despite the proven safety of outpatient FOB without sedation, many bronchoscopists administer complicated premedication regimens and employ ambulatory surgery beds or recovery rooms to monitor patients before and after procedures. These results support a simplified approach to routine FOB which would include no premedications and greater use of outpatient facilities resulting in decreased expenditures without compromising patient care, safety or comfort."

Moderate sedation codes were added to the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code set in 1998. These codes were as follows: 99141, sedation with or without analgesia (conscious sedation), intravenous, intramuscular, or inhalation; or 99142, sedation with or without analgesia (conscious sedation), oral, rectal, and/or intranasal. One of these two CPT codes was then used to bill for moderate sedation given during a bronchoscopic procedure.",

It should be noted that although total physician time calculates to 69 minutes, only the 39 minutes of moderate sedation are used to determine the appropriate codes. The remainder of the work time is captured in the bronchoscopy code. If an individual other than the bronchoscopist provides moderate sedation for 41 minutes in a 57-year-old woman, 99156 (for the initial 15 minutes) and two units of 99157 (for the subsequent 26 minutes) should be reported (Table 3).

No interventions are required to maintain cardiovascular function or a patent airway, and spontaneous ventilation is adequate. ' 5 Prior to 1998, there were no speci /uniFB01 c codes for sedation services provided by bronchoscopists, and services were coded by using anesthesia codes or were left uncoded and therefore unreimbursed. Moderate sedation codes were added to the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code set in 1998. These codes were as follows: 99141, sedation with or without analgesia (conscious sedation), intravenous, intramuscular, or inhalation; or 99142, sedation with or without analgesia (conscious sedation), oral, rectal, and/or intranasal. One of these two CPT codes was then used to bill for moderate sedation given during a bronchoscopic procedure.",

          "nd postservice work time (eg, re-evaluation of the patient following the procedure) are not included in the time for moderate sedation. For example, if the bronchoscopist spends 10 minutes reviewing the patient record, provides moderate sedation for 39 minutes during the procedure, and 20 minutes reviewing the /uniFB01 ndings with the patient after the procedure, in a 65-year-old man, 99152 (for the initial 15 minutes) and two units of 99153 (for the subsequent 24 minutes) should be reported. It should be noted that although total physician time calculates to 69 minutes, only the 39 minutes of moderate sedation are used to determine the appropriate codes. The remainder of the work time is captured in the bronchoscopy code. If an individual other than the bronchoscopist provides moderate sedation for 41 minutes in a 57-year-old woman, 99156 (for the initial 15 minutes) and two units of 99157 (for the subsequent 26 minutes) should be reported (Table 3).
