Topical lignocaine was sprayed on her upper and lower respiratory tract, as is usual to allow passage of the bronchoscope, but she required considerable amounts of spray to decrease discomfort. She was discharged from the centre after a 60-minute observation period, although she complained of chest discomfort. Fifteen minutes later, her boyfriend noted that she was very uncomfortable and could barely talk. He left her at his apartment so that she could have a nap, but when he returned an hour later she was having an epileptic fit. On admission to the emergency department, she was in cardiac arrest, and she died two days later.
