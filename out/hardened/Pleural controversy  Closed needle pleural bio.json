    "abstract": "The most efficient and cost-effective approach to the diagnosis of pleural exudates remains controversial. Important considerations include the respective diagnostic yields of thoracocentesis, closed pleural biopsy and thoracoscopy; the incremental gain in diagnostic yield when sequentially combining these investigations; and the role of various image modalities. The diagnostic yield of thoracocentesis is in the order of 60% for malignancy and > 90% for tuberculosis. A second aspiration may increase the yield for malignancy, but a third is generally superfluous. Many authorities consider thoracoscopy the investigation of choice in exudative pleural effusions where a thoracocentesis was nondiagnostic and particularly when malignancy is suspected.It allows for the direct inspection of the pleura and for talc poudrage. Thoracoscopy has a diagnostic yield of 91-95% for malignant disease and as high as 100% for pleural tuberculosis. Access to thoracoscopy is, however, limited in many parts of the world, as significant resources and expertise are required. Blind closed pleural biopsy has a yield of 80% for tuberculosis and < 60% for pleural malignancy. Recent studies suggest that CT and/or ultrasound guidance may improve the yield, particularly for malignancy, where it may be as high as 88% and 83%, respectively. A second thoracocentesis combined with an image-assisted pleural biopsy with either an Abrams needle or cutting needle, depending on the setting, may therefore be an acceptable alternative to thoracoscopy. With such an approach, thoracoscopy may potentially be reserved for cases not diagnosed by means of closed pleural biopsy. Key words: pleural biopsy, pleural disease, pleural effusion, thoracoscopy, ultrasound",

Important considerations include the respective diagnostic yields of thoracocentesis, closed pleural biopsy and thoracoscopy; the incremental gain in diagnostic yield when sequentially combining these investigations; and the role of various image modalities. The diagnostic yield of thoracocentesis is in the order of 60% for malignancy and > 90% for tuberculosis. A second aspiration may increase the yield for malignancy, but a third is generally superfluous. Many authorities consider thoracoscopy the investigation of choice in exudative pleural effusions where a thoracocentesis was nondiagnostic and particularly when malignancy is suspected.It allows for the direct inspection of the pleura and for talc poudrage. Thoracoscopy has a diagnostic yield of 91-95% for malignant disease and as high as 100% for pleural tuberculosis. Access to thoracoscopy is, however, limited in many parts of the world, as significant resources and expertise are required. Blind closed pleural biopsy has a yield of 80% for tuberculosis and < 60% for pleural malignancy. Recent studies suggest that CT and/or ultrasound guidance may improve the yield, particularly for malignancy, where it may be as high as 88% and 83%, respectively. A second thoracocentesis combined with an image-assisted pleural biopsy with either an Abrams needle or cutting needle, depending on the setting, may therefore be an acceptable alternative to"

The large calibre of the Abrams needle combined with the patient's respiratory movements can allow outside air to enter the pleural space if the device is not kept closed at all times. This is often aided by falling intrapleural pressure during evacuation of pleural fluid. Pneumothorax with an underlying bronchopleural fistula can occur if the lung is punctured or otherwise injured. Although a pneumothorax may be seen in up to 15% of patients undergoing biopsies, only a small minority require intervention. 8 Other complications include site pain (1-15%), vasovagal reaction with potential syncope (1-5%), haemothorax ( < 2%) and site haemorrhage with haematoma formation ( < 1%). 8 The fall in the incidence of TB in most of the developed world over the last 50 years has led to an equally significant reduction in operator experience among respiratory physicians, 8 to the point where even experienced pulmonologists have become reluctant to utilize blind closed pleural biopsy even in settings where the anticipated diagnostic yields are high."

The distribution of granulomatous inflammation in pleural TB is uniform over the pleura and visual aid therefore seemed to have offered little advantage beyond increased safety. Interestingly, and contrary to previous reports, the respective yield for both needle types for pleural malignancies was comparable and relatively high, with US-assisted Abrams needle diagnostic in 83.3%. 21 Wedid not utilize the US to specifically identify apparent diseased pleura, and did not limit biopsy sites to thickened pleura. One possible explanation for our relatively high yield, however, may be the fact that we utilized low biopsy sites, as the lower thoracic parietal pleura (close to the diaphragm) is more likely to contain secondary spread from visceral pleural metastases. Such an approach is possible with US assistance, but not with digital percussion as a guide (Fig. 2). Moreover, malignant disease tends to give rise to more focal pleural involvement, which may be discernable with US.",

No direct comparison of the procedures including data from a combination of all diagnostic tests performed on each specimen appears to have been done. A total of 385 patients with concurrent pleural biopsy and fluid examination were identified from 1973 to 1986. Clinical records, histologic and cytologic preparations, and microbiologic and chemical data were reviewed. A total of 109 patients had a final diagnosis of malignancy. Cytology was diagnostic in 71% and \"suggestive\" in an additional 8%. There were no false-positives but, in two patients with pulmonary infarcts, the effusions were reported as \"suspicious.\" Pleural biopsy was positive in 45%, including three cases with negative cytology. In 71 patients with tuberculosis, the pleural biopsy was diagnostic in 49%. A cytologic picture suggesting the diagnosis was present in 68%. Cultures of the biopsy yielded Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 23% of cases, while pleural fluid was positive in 30%. In six cases, the only confirmatory evidence of tuberculosis was pleural culture. In 205 patients, none of the above procedures provided specific diagnoses. A combination of biopsy and fluid examinations improves the diagnostic sensitivity. Pleural biopsy increases the rate of complications and did lead to fatal hemothorax in two patients. These results support the superiority of pleural fluid examination in the diagnosis of malignancy. In addition, they demonstrate the value of pleural fluid examination in the diagnosis of tuberculosis."

The recent revival was made possible by the tremendous advances in endoscopic technology. The main requirements for diagnostic purposes are rigid telescopes and forceps, and for interventional thoracoscopy scissors, staplers and a video recorder. The procedure can be performed either under local or general anaesthesia, with or without double lumen intubation, after inducing an artificial pneumothorax. At the end of the procedure, a chest tube should always be inserted, even if only for a few minutes until the lung re-expands. Main diagnostic indications are pleural effusions, pneumothorax and diffuse lung disease. Main therapeutic indications are pleurodesis by talcage in effusion and pneumothorax and a variety of diseases of the lung, the pleura and the mediastinum, where thoracotomy may be replaced by video-assisted thoracoscopy. The well-known indications of the past remain a domain of pneumologists, whereas minimal invasive thoracotomy is the task of thoracic surgeons. For some indications no sharp line has to be drawn, provided the facilities and skills are present, including those for the management of complications."

Both clinicians and pathologists question the optimal number of specimens required to detect a malignancy. We reviewed the computerized cytology files at Boston's Beth Israel Hospital from 1988 to 1991 to identify patients with two or more specimens from the same anatomic site. Two hundred and fifteen patients with a total of 570 specimens were identified. Before December 19, 1990, two direct smears were examined per fluid sample. After December 19, 1990, two direct smears and two cytospin preparations were examined. Medical records of patients without a positive diagnosis of cytology were reviewed. Overall, a cytological diagnosis of malignancy was made on at least one specimen for 55 patients (26%). The first positive diagnosis was made on the initial specimen in 36 patients (65%), on the second in 15 patients (27%), the third in three patients (5%), and the fifth in one patient (2%). For those specimens prepared with the two techniques described above (two direct and two concentrated smears), the first positive diagnosis was made on the initial specimen in 89% of the cases. Medical record review uncovered 55 additional patients who had clinical evidence of malignancy. Of these, 22 (40%) had at least one suspicious diagnosis of their fluid specimens. The first suspicious diagnosis was made with three or fewer specimens in all 22 patients. The majority of malignant effusions are detected with two specimens. Examination of more than three specimens is of little value. Multiple preparatory, especially concentration, techniques may increase the probability of detecting malignancy in one specimen."

        "abstract": "Thoracoscopy is the most accurate yet most expensive tool for establishing the diagnosis of tuberculous (TB) pleurisy. However, most high TB-incidence regions have limited financial resources, lack the infrastructure needed for routine thoracoscopy and require an alternative, cost-effective diagnostic approach for pleural effusions. Altogether, 51 patients with undiagnosed exudative pleural effusions were recruited for a prospective, direct comparison between bronchial wash, pleural fluid microbiology and biochemistry (adenosine deaminase (ADA) and cell count), closed needle biopsy, and medical thoracoscopy. The final diagnosis was TB in 42 patients (82%), malignancy in five (10%) and idiopathic in four patients (8%). Sensitivity of histology, culture and combined histology/culture was 66, 48 and 79%, respectively for closed needle biopsy and 100, 76 and 100%, respectively for thoracoscopy. Both were 100% specific. Pleural fluid ADA of &gt; or = 50 U x L(-1) was 95% sensitive and 89% specific. Combined ADA, lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio &gt; or = 0.75 plus closed needle biopsy reached 93% sensitivity and 100% specificity. A combination of pleural fluid adenosine deaminase, differential cell count and closed needle biopsy has a high diagnostic accuracy in undiagnosed exudative pleural effusions in areas with high incidences of tuberculosis and might substitute medical thoracoscopy at considerably lower expense in resource-poor countries."

Thus, it is considerably less invasive and less expensive. The main diagnostic and therapeutic indications for medical thoracoscopy are pleural effusions and pneumothorax. Due to its high diagnostic accuracy, approaching almost 100% in malignant and tuberculous pleural effusions, it should be used when pleural fluid analysis and needle biopsy are nondiagnostic. In addition, medical thoracoscopy provides staging for lung cancer and diffuse malignant mesothelioma. Talc poudrage, as the best conservative method for pleurodesis in 1998, can also be performed with medical thoracoscopy. It can also be effectively used in the early management of empyema. In spontaneous pneumothorax it allows staging, thereby facilitating treatment decisions, and in addition coagulation of eventual blebs and talc poudrage for efficient pleurodesis. Medical thoracoscopy is a safe procedure which is even easier to learn than flexible bronchoscopy. Due to its high diagnostic and therapeutic efficiency, it should be applied increasingly in the management of the above-mentioned pleuropulmonary diseases."

All the pleural exudates were initially screened three times successively and found to be sterile and without tumour cells. All thoracoscopies were performed with local anaesthesia, with the 'open technique', and nine different doctors performed the thoracoscopies. The overall diagnostic sensitivity was 90.4%. The results demonstrated 62% with malignancy of the pleura, and 38% revealed benign pleural diseases, among them 2% with tuberculosis. The sensitivity for malignancy was found to be 88% and the specificity 96%. The most common primary lung cancer with involvement of the pleura was the adenocarcinoma (62%), and the most common metastatic tumour originated from the breast (28%). The sensitivity for tuberculosis was 100% and the specificity 100%. No mortality was found, and the morbidity was low at about 0.6% (empyema, pleuro-cutaneous fistula, transcutaneous growth of tumour (mesothelioma)). In 64% of the patients the thoracoscopy resulted in treatment (pleurodesis, antituberculous treatment, chemotherapy and peroral steroid therapy). The medical diagnostic thoracoscopy in local anaesthesia is a simple, low-cost investigation with a relatively high diagnostic accuracy, no mortality and a low morbidity."

Both instruments were used on each patient, the Abrams punch being followed by the Tru-cut needle. There were no serious complications. The diagnoses determined by biopsy were: tuberculosis (11); carcinoma (12); chronic inflammation (9); and pleural fibrosis (4); one biopsy showed nothing abnormal. In 23 (62%) patients both biopsy needles produced adequate diagnostic material; in eight the Tru-cut needle alone produced diagnostic material and in six the Abrams punch alone. Thus diagnostic material was obtained in 31 patients from the Tru-cut needle and in 29 from the Abrams punch. The Tru-cut needle was useful and safe for pleural biopsy in this series and appeared to be particularly useful when the pleura was thickened."

The presence of pleural malignant disease was established by cytologic study in 162 patients (57.6%), by needle biopsy in 123 (43%), and by either cytologic analysis or biopsy in 182 (64.7%). In only 7.1% of the 281 patients with malignant pleural effusions did biopsy reveal malignant disease when the results of cytologic study were negative for malignant disease. Nearly half of the patients with lymphoma had lymphocytosis of the pleural fluid, but neither this finding nor the lymphocytic pleuritis noted on biopsy was diagnostic of lymphomatous involvement of the pleura. Among the patients with malignant mesothelioma, thoracotomy was necessary to confirm the diagnosis in 60.9%. In the patients with nonmalignant diseases, with the exception of six with tuberculous pleurisy, pleural biopsy was nondiagnostic even though the causes of pleural effusion were apparent from the clinical features. The causes of pleural effusion remained unknown in 82 patients (19.8%). Pleural biopsy failed to provide adequate tissue in 55 patients (13.3%). This study shows that cytologic analysis has a higher sensitivity (P less than 0.001) than needle biopsy for diagnosing malignant pleural effusions. The value of needle biopsy is limited in establishing the cause of pleural effusion that results from either malignant or nonmalignant disease, with the exception of tuberculous pleurisy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Seventy cases of tuberculous pleural effusion were identified and constituted 4.9 percent of all disease due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis during this period. Tuberculous pleural effusion was diagnosed if the patient had M tuberculosis cultured from sputum, pleura, or pleural fluid and had a roentgenographic pleural effusion without an alternative explanation for the presence of the effusion. The diagnosis of tuberculous pleural effusion was made in the absence of a positive culture if the patient had an undiagnosed lymphocytic exudative pleural effusion and all clinical and roentgenographic abnormalities resolved on antimycobacterial chemotherapy. The mean age of all patients was 47 +/- 18.4 years. The 70 cases were evenly divided between 35 that were accompanied by roentgenographic pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates and 35 that occurred in the absence of parenchymal infiltrates. We conclude that cultures of all potentially diagnostic specimens (sputum, pleural fluid, and pleura) and an intermediate-strength skin test, are sensitive tests for the diagnosis of tuberculous pleural effusion. In addition, the age of patients with tuberculous pleural effusion appears to be increasing."

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to define the number of pleural biopsy samples necessary for optimum diagnostic performance and determine to what extent they are complementary. Eighty-four closed pleural biopsies were performed in our department between June 1996 and January 1998 on 55 males and 29 females with an average age of 64.4 +/- 16.7 years. The study of the pleural fluid included: pH, biochemical testing of pleura/serum (proteins, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, albumin and adenosine deaminase), haemogram, cytology and microbiological testing (Gram-staining, aerobes, anaerobes and mycobacteriae cultures). The biopsies were performed using a Cope needle, with a total of five biopsies for each patient: four for pathological examination (taken numerically in the order in which they were performed: D1, D2, D3 and D4) and one for microbiological testing. In those cases in which the diagnosis was uncertain or effusion persisted, a thoracoscopy or thoracotomy was performed. There were no significant differences in the diagnostic yield of each individual sample (D1, D2, D3 and D4), but there were differences in the sum of the samples, depending on the number of biopsies performed.This was true for total group and the group with carcinomas, but not for the group with tuberculosis. The increase in diagnostic yield with the number of biopsies was more remarkable in the carcinoma cases, where it increased by 35% when four biopsies were performed (54% with one biopsy versus 89% with four biopsies, P &lt; 0.002). In conclusion, the diagnostic yield increased with the number of biopsy samples in the total group and the group with malignancy but not in the group with tuberculous effusions. The best diagnostic performance for malignant pathology was obtained with four samples. In pleural tuberculosis, the diagnostic yield did not increase with more biopsy samples. One high quality sample should be enough to obtain a diagnosis."

Pulmonary vessels and vascular supply of consolidations may be visualized without contrast. US may help to diagnose conditions such as pneumothorax, hemothorax, pleural or pericardial effusion, pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism in the critically ill patient who is in need of bedside diagnostic testing. The technique of US, which is cost-effective compared to CT scanning and MRI, may be learned relatively easily by the pulmonologist."

A total of 49 patients with unilateral pleural effusion were included in this study. Twenty-four patients underwent a traditional pleural biopsy with an Abrams needle, and 25 patients underwent a US-guided pleural biopsy with a Tru-Cut needle. The age, sex, and underlying diseases in both groups were compatible. The amount of effusion was much less in the Tru-Cut group. In the patients who underwent the US-guided pleural biopsy with a Tru-Cut needle, the diagnostic sensitivity in pleural tuberculosis was 86 percent (6/7) and in pleural neoplasia it was 70 percent (7/10). In the patients who underwent traditional pleural biopsy with an Abrams needle, the diagnostic sensitivity in pleural tuberculosis was 20 percent (2/10) and in pleural neoplasia it was 44 percent (4/9). The result of US-guided pleural biopsy with a Tru-Cut needle was better than that of pleural biopsy with an Abrams needle, especially in pleural tuberculosis. No complication was found in the Tru-Cut group, but breakage and dislodgment of the tip of an Abrams needle occurred in one patient. The higher diagnostic yield in the Tru-Cut group may be attributed to the US guidance that can delineate the focal pleural abnormalities for biopsy. In conclusion, US-guided pleural biopsy by using a Tru-Cut needle was simple, safe, and well tolerated. It was particularly useful for patients with pleural tumor, thickened pleura, small amounts of pleural effusion, or loculated pleural effusion."

A physician performed ultrasound and FNAB with a 22-G spinal needle in all patients, directly followed by a 14-G CNB in patients without contraindication. A total of 155 consecutive lesions arising from the lung (74%), pleura (12%), mediastinum (11%) or chest wall (3%) in patients with a final diagnosis of lung carcinoma (74%), other malignant tumours (12%), non-neoplastic disease (9%) or unknown (5%) were prospectively included. The overall diagnostic yield was 87%. Combined specimens were obtained in 123 lesions (79%). In these, yields of FNAB, CNB and both methods combined were 82, 76 and 89%, respectively. FNAB was significantly better than CNB in lung carcinoma (95 versus 81%) but CNB was superior in noncarcinomatous tumours and in benign lesions. On-site cytology was 90% sensitive and 100% specific for predicting a positive FNAB. One patient required drainage for pneumothorax (0.6%). Ultrasound-assisted fine-needle aspiration biopsy performed by chest physicians is an accurate and safe initial diagnostic procedure in patients with a high clinical probability of lung carcinoma. All other patients should undergo concurrent fine-needle aspiration biopsy and cutting-needle biopsy."

The aims of the present prospective study were to asses the diagnostic yield and safety of US-assisted TTFNA and CNB in SVC syndrome with an associated mass lesion abutting the chest wall. Over a 3-yr period, the present authors screened 59 patients with SVC syndrome, and enrolled 25 patients who had an associated mass lesion that extended to the chest wall. US-assisted TTFNA with rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) was performed in all cases. CNBs were performed where a provisional diagnosis of bronchogenic carcinoma could not be established, and in 57.1% of patients with bronchogenic carcinoma (limited due to safety constraints). ROSE of US-assisted TTFNA confirmed diagnostically useful material in 24 patients, and cytological diagnoses were ultimately made in all of these cases (diagnostic yield 96%). US-assisted CNB had a diagnostic yield of 87.5%. Minor haemorrhage occurred in one out of 25 TTFNA and three out of 16 CNB. Neither procedure resulted in major haemorrhage nor pneumothoraces. US-assisted TTFNA and CNB have a high diagnostic yield and are safe in the setting of SVC syndrome with an associated mass lesion abutting the chest wall."

At the bedside, US helps to visualize neoplasms in the chest wall, pleura, peripheral lung, and anterior mediastinum involving or abutting the pleura. Histology specimens from cutting-needle biopsies have been shown to be safe and effective. This prospective study determined the yield and safety of US-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) as a first-line bedside investigation. We recruited 97 consecutive patients, and of these, 85 underwent both cutting-needle biopsy and FNAB. These were adequate for diagnosis in 81.2% and 80% of cases, respectively, with a combined yield of 90%. Measured with a novel semiquantitative score, FNAB allowed a diagnosis with fewer special investigations than cutting biopsy. US-guided FNAB by pulmonologists performed best in lung carcinoma and can be recommended as a first-line investigation in patients with a high clinical suspicion of this diagnosis."

Criteria for randomised clinical trial (RCT) eligibility were random allocation of patients and non-concurrent use of another experimental medication or device. Methodological quality evaluation of the trials was based on randomisation, blinding, allocation concealment and intention to treat analysis. A random effect model was used to combine the relative risk estimates of the treatment effects whenever pooling for an overall effect was considered appropriate. Forty-six RCTs with a total of 2053 patients with malignant pleural effusions were reviewed for effectiveness of pleurodesis. Talc tended to be associated with fewer recurrences when compared to bleomycin (RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.34-1.20) and, with more uncertainty, to tetracycline (RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.06-4.42). Tetracycline (or doxycycline) was not superior to bleomycin (RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.61-1.38). When compared with bedside talc slurry, thoracoscopic talc insufflation was associated with a reduction in recurrence (RR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.05-0.93). Strategies such as rolling the patient after instillation of the sclerosing agent, protracted drainage of the effusion and use of larger chest tubes were not found to have any substantial advantages. Talc appears to be effective and should be the agent of choice for pleurodesis. Thoracoscopic talc insufflation is associated with fewer recurrences of effusions compared with bedside talc slurry, but this is based on two small studies. Where thoracoscopy is unavailable bedside talc pleurodesis has a high success rate and is the next best option."
