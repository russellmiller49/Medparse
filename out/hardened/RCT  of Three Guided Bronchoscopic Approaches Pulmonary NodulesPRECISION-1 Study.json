Despite decades of effort, evidence suggests that the diagnostic accuracy for electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy (EMN) and radial endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) approach only 50%. New developments in robotic bronchoscopy (RB) may offer improvements in the assessment of PPNs.\nMETHODS: A prospective single-blinded randomized controlled comparative study to assess success in localization and puncture of PPNs, using an ultrathin bronchoscope with radial EBUS (UTB-rEBUS) vs EMN vs RB in a human cadaver model of PPNs < 2 cm, was performed. The primary end point was the ability to successfully localize and puncture the target nodule, veriÔ¨Åed by cone-beam CT comparing RB and EMN. Secondary end points included needle to target position ‚Äúmiss‚Äù distance, and UTB-rEBUS comparisons.\nRESULTS: Sixty procedures were performed to target 20 PPNs over the study period. Implanted PPNs were distributed across all lobes, with 80% located within the lung periphery. The target PPN mean diameter was 16.5 1.5 mm, with 50% noted to have a CT bronchus sign. The rate of successful PPN localization and puncture was superior when using RB, compared with EMN (80% vs 45%; P ¬º .02). Among unsuccessful needle passes, the median needle to target ‚Äúmiss‚Äù distance was signiÔ¨Åcantly different when comparing UTB-rEBUS, EMN, and RB (P ¬º .0014).\nCONCLUSIONS: In a cadaver model, use of RB signiÔ¨Åcantly increased the ability to localize and successfully puncture small PPNs when compared with existing technologies.

The /uniFB01 rst prototypes incorporated an outer diameter of 5 mm with the ability to provide 180 and 120 degrees of /uniFB02 exion and extension, respectively. Since the initial unveiling of the FB, revisions have been made to both bronchoscope design and maneuverability for PPN evaluation; however, aside from small improvements to outer diameter size and adoption of digital imaging, little substantive change has been made. 2"

Electromagnetic navigation (EMN), virtual bronchoscopy, radial endobronchial ultrasound (rEBUS), guide sheaths, and advances in peripheral sampling tools have emerged in hopes of optimizing yield with a reported diagnostic yield of 70% regardless of which modality was used.

To emulate PPNs, pseudotumors were prepared with animal protein and iodinated contrast visible by rEBUS and chest CT imaging. After preparation, each cadaver underwent CT imaging to allow planning of peripheral target placements of the pseudotumors, using a /uniFB02 oor-mounted system with DynaCT and guidance software (Artis zeego SW VD11C; Siemens Inc.). The nonintervention team selected target PPN placement locations to achieve a distribution of nodules in either the peripheral or mid-lung zones across all lobes.

        "to": "BACKGROUND: The capability of bronchoscopy in the diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary nodules (PPNs) remains limited. Despite decades of effort, evidence suggests that the diagnostic accuracy for electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy (EMN) and radial endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) approach only 50%. New developments in robotic bronchoscopy (RB) may offer improvements in the assessment of PPNs.\nMETHODS: A prospective single-blinded randomized controlled comparative study to assess success in localization and puncture of PPNs, using an ultrathin bronchoscope with radial EBUS (UTB-rEBUS) vs EMN vs RB in a human cadaver model of PPNs < 2 cm, was performed. The primary end point was the ability to successfully localize and puncture the target nodule, veriÔ¨Åed by cone-beam CT comparing RB and EMN. Secondary end points included needle to target position ‚Äúmiss‚Äù distance, and UTB-rEBUS comparisons.\nRESULTS: Sixty procedures were performed to target 20 PPNs over the study period. Implanted PPNs were distributed across all lobes, with 80% located within the lung periphery. The target PPN mean diameter was 16.5 1.5 mm, with 50% noted to have a CT bronchus sign. The rate of successful PPN localization and puncture was superior when using RB, compared with EMN (80% vs 45%; P ¬º .02). Among unsuccessful needle passes, the median needle to target ‚Äúmiss‚Äù distance was signiÔ¨Åcantly different when comparing UTB-rEBUS, EMN, and RB (P ¬º .0014).\nCONCLUSIONS: In a cadaver model, use of RB signiÔ¨Åcantly increased the ability to localize and successfully puncture small PPNs when compared with existing technologies. This study demonstrates the potential of RB to precisely reach, localize, and puncture small nodules in the periphery of the lung. CHEST 2020; 157(3):694-701",

        "abstract": "Concentric tube robots can enable new clinical interventions if they are able to pass through soft tissue, deploy along desired paths through open cavities, or travel along winding lumens. These behaviors require the robot to deploy in such a way that the curved shape of its shaft remains unchanged as the tip progresses forward (i.e., \"follow-the-leader\" deployment). Follow-the-leader deployment is challenging for concentric tube robots due to elastic (and particularly torsional) coupling between the tubes that form the robot. However, as we show in this paper, follow-the-leader deployment is possible, provided that tube precurvatures and deployment sequences are appropriately selected. We begin by defining follow-the-leader deployment and providing conditions that must be satisfied for a concentric tube robot to achieve it. We then examine several useful special cases of follow-the-leader deployment, showing that both circular and helical precurvatures can be employed, and provide an experimental illustration of the helical case. We also explore approximate follow-the-leader behavior and provide a metric for the similarity of a general deployment to a follow-the-leader deployment. Finally, we consider access to the hippocampus in the brain to treat epilepsy, as a motivating clinical example for follow-the-leader deployment."

If nonsurgical biopsy techniques are considered, deciding between bronchoscopic transbronchial versus computed tomography-guided transthoracic biopsy can be difficult. The former has a low diagnostic yield with a low complication risk, whereas the latter has a better diagnostic yield but a higher complication rate. Investigators have looked at various lesion characteristics that can predict the diagnostic yield of guided bronchoscopic biopsies. Although consensus exists that larger size and proximity to the hilum increase the diagnostic yield, there is ongoing debate about the association between computed tomography bronchus sign (air-filled bronchus in close proximity of the lesion as seen on computed tomography imaging) and the diagnostic yield of guided bronchoscopic modalities."

However, as cases and control recruitment processes are often different, it is not always obvious that the necessary exchangeability conditions hold. Selection bias typically arises when the selection criteria are associated with the risk factor under investigation. We develop a method which produces bias-adjusted estimates for the odds ratio. Our method hinges on 2 conditions. The first is that a variable that separates the risk factor from the selection criteria can be identified. This is termed the \"bias breaking\" variable. The second condition is that data can be found such that a bias-corrected estimate of the distribution of the bias breaking variable can be obtained. We show by means of a set of examples that such bias breaking variables are not uncommon in epidemiologic settings. We demonstrate using simulations that the estimates of the odds ratios produced by our method are consistently closer to the true odds ratio than standard odds ratio estimates using logistic regression. Further, by applying it to a case-control study, we show that our method can help to determine whether selection bias is present and thus confirm the validity of study conclusions when no evidence of selection bias can be found."

For these procedures, a thin-slice chest CT scan is performed prior to bronchoscopy at full inspiration and is used to create virtual airway reconstructions that are used as a map during bronchoscopy. Movement of the lung occurs with respiratory variation during bronchoscopy, and the location of pulmonary nodules during procedures may differ significantly from their location on the initial planning full-inspiratory chest CT scan. This study was performed to quantify pulmonary nodule movement from full inspiration to end-exhalation during tidal volume breathing in patients undergoing electromagnetic navigation procedures."
