Lung volume reduction surgery is well established for patients in a highly elective setting. It is, however, contraindicated in cases of acute cardiorespiratory failure. We present the case of a patient with severe emphysema who had acute respiratory failure and decompensated cor pulmonale requiring life-saving venovenoarterial extracorporeal life support after admission to the emergency unit. He underwent lung volume reduction surgery with intent to wean from extracorporeal life support. He had complete functional recovery after 4 months."

Selection criteria for surgery were de /uniFB01 ned by the National Emphysema Treatment Trial and others [2 -5]. Lung volume reduction surgery is deemed to be an elective procedure performed after pulmonary rehabilitation and is generally not advised for ventilator-dependent patients with respiratory failure. Hansson and colleagues [6] described the case of a patient who required invasive mechanical ventilation owing to acute respiratory failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, bilateral pneumothoraces, and massive air leak.

        "abstract": "We undertook surgical bilateral lung volume reduction in 20 patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to relieve thoracic distention and improve respiratory mechanics. The operation, done through median sternotomy, involves excision of 20% to 30% of the volume of each lung. The most affected portions are excised with the use of a linear stapling device fitted with strips of bovine pericardium attached to both the anvil and the cartridge to buttress the staple lines and eliminate air leakage through the staple holes. Preoperative and postoperative assessment of results has included grading of dyspnea and quality of life, exercise performance, and objective measurements of lung function by spirometry and plethysmography. There has been no early or late mortality and no requirement for immediate postoperative ventilatory assistance. Follow-up ranges from 1 to 15 months (mean 6.4 months). The mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second has improved by 82% and the reduction in total lung capacity, residual volume, and trapped gas has been highly significant. These changes have been associated with marked relief of dyspnea and improvement in exercise tolerance and quality of life. Although the follow-up period is short, these preliminary results suggest that bilateral surgical volume reduction may be of significant value for selected patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."

The NETT was not a crossover trial and therefore was able to examine the effects of optimal medical management and LVRS on short- and long-term survival,as well as lung function, exercise performance, and quality of life.The NETT generated multiple insights into the preoperative, perioperative,and postoperative management of patients undergoing thoracotomy; described pain control techniques that were safe and effective; and emphasized the need to address nonpulmonary issues to optimize surgical outcomes. After the NETT, newer investigation has focused on bronchoscopic endobronchial interventions and other techniques less invasive than LVRS to achieve lung reduction.In this review, we summarize what we currently know about the role of LVRS in the treatment of severe emphysema as a result of insights gained from the NETT and provide a brief review of the newer techniques of lung volume reduction."

        "abstract": "Patient selection for lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) relies on sound physiologic concepts and experience from large case series. LVRS should be considered in severely symptomatic emphysema with marked airflow obstruction and hyperinflation despite optimal medical management, and in the absence of major comorbidities associated with excessive perioperative risks. Qualitative estimation of functional benefit from LVRS in suitable candidates has been based on functional criteria (e.g., high inspiratory conductance, high residual volume/total lung capacity ratio), on heterogeneity of emphysema assessed by computed tomography (CT) or perfusion scans, and on severity of emphysema assessed by CT or impaired diffusing capacity. Selection strategies relying on such criteria have provided favorable functional results at a low mortality, but further validation of potential outcome predictors in prospective trials is needed."

        "abstract": "Patients with a homogeneous type of emphysema have been excluded a priori from LVRS in many centers because of the fear of removing parenchyma, which potentially contributes to gas exchange, and because the observation that heterogeneity of emphysema is a predictor of functional improvement. It is obvious that resection of functionless tissue, such as in heterogeneous emphysema with bullae, can be advised to the patient with a relative low risk. However, as the main positive effect of LVRS is its improvement on respiratory mechanics, it is not surprising that well-selected patients with homogeneous emphysema also benefit from surgery. Their selection has to be done cautiously. It is crucial to exclude patients with a very low functional reserve, such as with diffusing capacity below 20% predicted or with pulmonary hypertension, and with extreme parenchymal loss (vanished lungs) on CT from LVRS. Additionally, cofactors which may potentially interfere with a smooth postoperative course, such as previous recurrent infections, extensive scarring of the lungs, or previous surgery, have to be taken into consideration. When respecting these caveats, LVRS in patients with complete homogeneous emphysema provides a comparable symptomatic and almost the same functional improvement as in patients with heterogeneous emphysema. Although the perioperative mortality is low, patients with homogeneous emphysema have a slightly reduced long-term survival without lung transplantation compared with patients with heterogeneous emphysema. Based on our own experience, we conclude that LVRS can be recommended to selected symptomatic patients with advanced homogenous emphysema associated with severe hyperinflation, if diffusing capacity is not below 20% of predicted values and if the CT scan does not show aspects of vanished lungs."

        "abstract": "Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) is an established therapeutic option for patients with advanced pulmonary emphysema after all conservative measures, including comprehensive pulmonary rehabilitation, have been exhausted. LVRS improves pulmonary function, shortness of breath, exercise capacity and hence quality of life in some 80% of cases for up to four years. Even patients with homogeneous types of pulmonary emphysema improve if those with extremely low FEV1 and/or very low diffusion capacity are excluded. At experienced centres perioperative mortality is less than 2% in appropriately selected patients, and current results suggest that the five-year survival in COPD patients may even be improved by this palliative surgical intervention. In patients under 60 LVRS may serve as a bridging procedure to lung transplantation. Bronchoscopic creation of extraanatomic bronchopulmonary passages--endoscopic LVRS--is a novel approach now under investigation."

Although clear-cut guidelines to select candidates have not been fully established, patients decompensated with significant pulmonary artery hypertension and hypercapnic respiratory failure are currently not considered suitable subjects. Accordingly, ventilator-dependent COPD patients are not considered candidates for this procedure. However, because ventilator-dependent COPD patients have an exceptionally poor prognosis, we elected to offer them this promising, but unproved surgical intervention. Herein, we describe the outcome of these three patients."
