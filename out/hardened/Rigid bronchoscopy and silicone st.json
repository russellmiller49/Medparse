Rigid bronchoscopy is an invaluable tool in the diagnosis and management of several malignant and non-malignant causes of central airway obstruction (CAO) and has become integral after the inception of airway stenting. The management of CAO can be a complicated endeavor with significant risks making the understanding of basic rigid bronchoscopy techniques, ablative technologies, anesthetic care and stenting of utmost importance in the care of these complex patients. This review article will focus on the history of rigid bronchoscopy, the technical aspects of performing a rigid bronchoscopy as well as the use of silicone stents their indications, complications and placement techniques.",

Rigid bronchoscopy with foreign body removal quickly evolved into the treatment of choice in these patients, with a clinical success rate above 98% (2). During the early 1900's, Killian published extensively and lectured throughout the world. He further went on to adapt his bronchoscopes, laryngoscopes and endoscopes, and first described techniques such as using fluoroscopy and X-ray to define endobronchial anatomy. The design and functionality of the rigid bronchoscope was improved further in 1904 when Chevalier Jackson, who is regarded as the father of American bronchoesophagology first equipped"

Rigid bronchoscopy is an invaluable tool in the diagnosis and management of several malignant and non-malignant causes of central airway obstruction (CAO) and has become integral after the inception of airway stenting. The management of CAO can be a complicated endeavor with significant risks making the understanding of basic rigid bronchoscopy techniques, ablative technologies, anesthetic care and stenting of utmost importance in the care of these complex patients. This review article will focus on the history of rigid bronchoscopy, the technical aspects of performing a rigid bronchoscopy as well as the use of silicone stents their indications, complications and placement techniques."

Silicone stents have been in use since the 1960's and have a long track record of safety. Metal stents continue to evolve from the original uncovered metal stents to a number of newly designed covered metal stents made of nitinol. Unfortunately, the 'ideal stent' has not yet been developed. This stent would be easy to insert and remove, yet not migrate; of sufficient strength to support the airway, yet be flexible enough to mimic normal airway physiology and promote secretion clearance; biologically inert to minimize the formation of granulation tissue; and available in a variety of sizes."

Silicone stents can also have one end with a smaller diameter for optimal positioning. Y stents come with multiple various tracheal and bronchial limb diameters. These stents generally come in a uniform length, which can be adjusted at that time of insertion by shortening each of the three limbs to the desired length using a scalpel during the procedure. Other modifications can also be made at the time of insertion including the cutting of holes to allow ventilation of lobar bronchi covered by the stent during placement. Silicone stents can be made of transparent nonradio opaque material, or melted with barium sulfate, which are white in color, non-transparent but radio-opaque (27)."

This stent is made of polyethylene threads embedded in a layer of silicone. These stents have a thin wall resulting in a better inner to outer diameter ratio compared to a Dumon stent. However, as they are not studded on the outside may have a higher rate of migration. They are embedded with tungsten making them radioopaque and are deployed out of a semi-rigid tube inserted down a rigid bronchoscope. There are a small number of other companies commercially producing other types of silicone stents such as those manufactured by Hood (Hood Laboratories, Pembroke, MA, USA) with similar properties as the Dumon stent."

These were initially described by Freitag et al. in 1994 (28) and are composed of anteriorly placed U shaped metal rings in the tracheal limb, with a silicone posterior membrane that can be dynamically compressed during cough to physiologically mimic the human trachea and allow for better mucus clearance. Finally, there are also numerous types of T-tubes and T-tube Y stent combinations manufactured currently for different types of tracheal and carinal pathology. This review will primarily focus on endobronchial silicone stents (27)."

Stents may be the only resource available to maintain airway patency in extrinsic compression, as simple dilation is  extremely transient if successful at all. In terms of endobronchial disease and mixed obstruction, stents are generally placed after excision and destruction of tumor has occurred to maintain patency and attempt to avoid recurrent obstruction by tumor re-growth or until systemic chemotherapy or radiation treatment has time to take effect. Post obstructive pneumonia caused by malignant airway obstruction is another appropriate indication, which may be necessary to maintain patency and provide adequate source control of the infected lobe or segment (29)."

Silicone stents play an even larger role in benign disease, as they are preferred over metal stents due to complications with granulation of metal stents into the airway, difficulty with removal and fistula formation. Another benign indication for silicone stenting is stabilization of collapsing airways  secondary  to  tracheobronchial  malacia  or cartilaginous disorders such as relapsing polychondritis. Finally, the last category of disease necessitating silicone stenting  is  to  cover  airway-esophageal  or  airwaymediastinal fistulas caused by malignant disease, iatrogenic complications of esophageal stenting, radiation therapy, or dehiscence of transplanted airways (29)."

Once an appropriate size  has  been  determined  the  length  of  the  lesion should be measured using the rigid camera or flexible bronchoscope with the stent extending about 5-10 mm proximal and distal to the lesion. In sizing stents for fistulas, one should slightly oversize the stent as there is no endobronchial lesion to anchor the stent to, making migration more likely (27)."

The rigid bronchoscope should then be placed slightly distal or within the stenosis. A prosthesis pusher is then placed through the hollow stent deployment tube and these are both placed down the rigid bronchoscope as ventilation is held. If the scope is positioned distal to the lesion, the rigid scope can be slightly withdrawn simultaneously as the stent is deployed to allow the stent to deploy within the stenosis. The deployment device is then removed and the camera alongside forceps should be placed back into the rigid scope. The stent may fully deploy, but generally requires being pulled back into optimal position, or slightly rotated to fully open. If manual rotation or adjustment does not fully open the stent the barrel of the rigid scope can be used to open the stent carefully without pushing it distally or a CRE balloon may be used to help expand the stent (30). If that is still unsuccessful, the stent is likely too large for the lesion and needs to be removed with a smaller diameter stent re-deployed."

In both techniques the stent is loaded into the stent deployment device after lubrication with care taken to note the directionality in which the stent is folded in order to deploy the left and right limbs in the proper orientation. In the first technique the rigid bronchoscope is positioned above the carina based on the length of the tracheal limb. The stent is pushed out into the trachea in a similar fashion as described above and then using a camera, forceps and the rigid scope the stent is advanced and turned to position the left and right limbs appropriately in their respective mainstem bronchi flush with the carina."

As the stent is being deployed the rigid scope is slowly withdrawn back into the trachea until the stent is fully out of the deployer. The rigid telescopes as well as forceps are then used to pull the stent back gently from the mainstem it was deployed in, allowing the shorter limb to fall into place in the contralateral bronchus.

After inspection of the airway with a rigid or flexible bronchoscope and measurements made to determine the size of the dynamic Y stent to be placed the scope is  removed and the patient ventilated with a bag valve mask or laryngeal mask airway until the stent is ready to be deployed. The dynamic Y airway stent is loaded onto a specific deployment device, which is a modification of rigid foreign body retrieval forceps, with longer jaws onto which the right and left mainstem limbs are inserted over. The operator then using direct laryngoscopy with either a Macintosh or Miller blade inserts the stent at a 90 degree angle carefully through the vocal cords on top of the deployment forceps using their right hand. Once the stent is fully inside the trachea, the stent is rotated 90 degrees clockwise and advanced until slight resistance is met. At this point the jaws of the forceps are opened and the stent is pushed further forward onto the carina (using a device connected to the deployment apparatus) until further resistance is met. At this point the jaws are closed and the deployment forceps withdrawn from the glottis. The patient is then rigidly intubated and the rigid camera and forceps are used to adjust the stent if necessary by further pushing it forward or rotating it to optimally seat it on the carina. The patient does need to tolerate a certain amount of apnea during deployment of a dynamic Y stent and the operator must be confident in their ability to obtain a good glottic view and rapidly re-intubate the patient with the rigid bronchoscope in the case of poor deployment and obstruction of the trachea by the stent. T o aid in intubation or for training purposes, placement of dynamic Y stents with a video laryngoscope can be done to allow both the trainee and instructor to have a view of the glottis (31)."

Complications from rigid bronchoscopy and stenting are in general very low, however when consenting a patient prior to a procedure a multitude of risks should generally be discussed including trauma to the oral cavity (lips,  gums,  teeth,  tongue,  pharynx), the vocal cords, the trachea and bronchi themselves, bleeding, infection, tracheal or bronchial rupture, hypoxia, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, cardiac arrest and even death. If stenting is to be performed then the risks of stent placement are generally listed including mucus plugging, migration, formation of granulation tissue, bacterial overgrowth, halitosis and repeat procedures to inspect the stent, adjust if migrated and remove granulation tissue. Depending on the clinical stability of the patient different levels of emphasis can be placed on more serious complications such as respiratory failure and death. The overall risk and benefit of the procedure can then be discussed with the patient and family and an informed decision can be made to proceed, even in high-risk situations."

Only 44 patients (3.9%) were reported to have complications, which were defined as: bleeding requiring intervention, pneumothorax, hypoxemia, clinically significant airway injury, hypotension, arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation and death. Of those reported complications 61% of those patients required a higher level of care. There were six deaths reported within 24 hours, four of which were secondary to a complication of the procedure and two unrelated.

Of note the use of neuromuscular blockade was associated with decreased rate of complications. This is likely due to the ability to oxygenate/ventilate better during the procedure as well as improved visualization due to lack of cough and patient movement. The study also examined risk factors for death at 30 days (14.8%) which were found to be associated with ASA >3, intrinsic or mixed obstructions or placement of a stent. The association with stenting and higher 30-day mortality is not likely due to the stent itself or stent complications, but rather to confounding factors including the fact that patients requiring stents likely have a higher level of disease burden are generally sicker and may not have other systemic treatment options remaining. Overall, the mortality/morbidity from therapeutic bronchoscopy is low when used in the appropriate setting."

Rigid bronchoscopy is an invaluable tool in the diagnosis and management of several malignant and non-malignant causes of central airway obstruction (CAO) and has become integral after the inception of airway stenting. The management of CAO can be a complicated endeavor with significant risks making the understanding of basic rigid bronchoscopy techniques, ablative technologies, anesthetic care and stenting of utmost importance in the care of these complex patients. This review article will focus on the history of rigid bronchoscopy, the technical aspects of performing a rigid bronchoscopy as well as the use of silicone stents their indications, complications and placement techniques.",

First, answers to some of the questions, particularly those pertaining to complication rates, rely on the memory of participants. Second, the wording of certain questions may have imparted different meanings. Third, the format of the questionnaire may have confused some. Fourth, one cannot expect that all questionnaires will be answered fully. Fifth, as indicated by several respondents, several important topics (eg, topical anesthetic agents and mode of their delivery, prophylaxis against infective endocarditis, tracheobronchial stent placement, endobronchial intraluminal radiotherapy) were not included. Many respondents suggested inclusion of these and other questions in future surveys. Nevertheless, in the absence of any survey looking into a large number of bronchoscopy-related practices, mail surveys have the advantage of reflecting nationwide practice rather than results from selected centers, and this report provides some insight into bronchoscopy practices in North America. While the results indicate the present trends in bronchoscopy practices in North America, they do not establish or recommend any standards in bronchoscopy."

Dependable methods have also been developed for laryngotracheal and carinal resection and reconstruction. The daunting problem of long congenital tracheal stenosis appears to be largely solved by slide tracheoplasty. In the past four decades much has also been learned about the etiology, natural history, pathology, and (in some cases) prevention of tracheal diseases including primary and secondary tumors, postintubation injuries, and idiopathic stenosis."

A complete resection is required to potentially improve survival of these patients. Lobectomy is the minimum resection of choice. En bloc resections of involved adjacent organs and structures are performed routinely with acceptable morbidity and mortality. Mediastinal lymph node dissection allows accurate surgical and pathologic staging of lymph node disease but has yet to be proven efficacious as a curative procedure. The standard approach to the hemithorax is via posterolateral thoracotomy. Recent muscle-sparing incisions and video-assisted techniques have been employed safely to accomplish goals of surgery. This article evaluates past and current approaches to the resection of NSCLC, and looks at the impact of route and extent of resection on survival of NSCLC patients."

The management of central airway obstruction, pleural disease diagnosis, treatment and palliation, advanced bronchoscopic techniques to aid in the diagnosis of lung cancer and innovative therapies to treat asthma and COPD have all emerged over the past decade. As astute clinicians, we are all aware of the risks and benefits of using these therapies to treat our patients. In order to appropriately treat and manage these often complex medical situations, the physician should have an expert knowledge of all available modalities, the expertise to safely perform the procedure and the ability to minimize the risk of and manage the associated complications that may arise. In this chapter we review and update some of the bronchoscopic and pleural interventions offered by interventional pulmonologists as well as the associated complications and management."

        "abstract": "Due to growing interest in management of central airway obstruction, rigid bronchoscopy is undergoing a resurgence in popularity among pulmonologists. Performing rigid bronchoscopy requires use of deep sedation or general anesthesia to achieve adequate patient comfort, whereas maintaining oxygenation and ventilation via an uncuffed and often open rigid bronchoscope requires use of ventilation strategies that may be unfamiliar to most pulmonologists. Available approaches include apneic oxygenation, spontaneous assisted ventilation, controlled ventilation, manual jet, and high-frequency jet ventilation. Anesthetic technique is partially dictated by the selected ventilation strategy but most often relies on a total intravenous anesthetic approach using ultra-short-acting sedatives and hypnotics for a rapid offset of action in this patient population with underlying respiratory compromise. Gas anesthetic may be used with the rigid bronchoscope, minimizing leaks with fenestrated caps placed over the ports, although persistent circuit leaks can make this approach challenging. Jet ventilation, the most commonly used ventilatory approach, may be delivered manually using a Sanders valve or via an automated ventilator at supraphysiologic respiratory rates, allowing for an open rigid bronchoscope to facilitate ease of moving tools in and out of the airway. Despite a patient population that often suffers from significant respiratory compromise, major complications with rigid bronchoscopy are uncommon and are similar among modern ventilation approaches. Choice of ventilation technique should be determined by local expertise and equipment availability. Appropriate patient selection and recognition of limitations associated with a given ventilation strategy are critical to avoid procedural-related complications."

        "abstract": "A feasibility study was carried out to prove the benefits of powered instrumentation, i.e. microdebrider in revisional surgery under local anaesthesia of chronic sinusitis in out-patients. Acceptance by the patients was investigated by questionnaire. Out-patient surgery is well tolerated by the majority (79.2%) of patients. Ninety-four percent would undergo the treatment again if necessary. An operation under general anaesthesia could be avoided in the cases we submitted to investigation. The cost-effectiveness of the method is thus an important consideration, despite calculating high prime costs and rather expensive, expendable instrumentation. Special consideration is attributed to a new feature added to the debrider device. To improve out-patient care, we developed an integrated electrocoagulation unit which supplements the microdebrider. It proved to be effective and easy to use. Bleeding was reduced to a minimum. Hence, nasal packing could be avoided in all out-patient cases. The possibility of causing severe complications using the microdebrider-technique is not eliminated as was shown in the anatomical specimens. Based on our experience, reduction of strong bony structures is subject to limitations at present. We therefore recommend the use of microdebriders for soft tissue manipulations, especially in revisional surgery. The microdebrider proved to be a significant advantage in out-patient surgery for recurrent sinusitis."

This study describes the use of a flexible cryoprobe for cryotherapy using nitrous oxide as a cryogen through a fiberoptic bronchoscope. The study group consisted of 22 patients, ages ranging from 28 to 82 years. Twenty patients had malignant TBO and two had bronchial obstruction (BO) following lung transplantation. Benign BO was first dilated with a balloon and followed with cryotherapy. Eighteen of the 20 malignant endobronchial lesions were completely removed. In three of these patients, the airway remained occluded due to extrinsic compression. Cryotherapy offers an alternative to Nd:YAG laser in the management of TBO. Cryotherapy offers other advantages such as being inexpensive, safe for the operator, and safe for other members of the team. Similarly for the patient, there is no danger of bronchial wall perforation or endobronchial fires, cryotherapy can be done under local anesthesia with conscious sedation, and it can be performed in an endoscopy suite."

We wanted to determine whether these problems could be solved by a different stent design. Based on theoretical considerations of an idealized trachea, we developed a dynamic bifurcation stent made of silicone which incorporates horseshoe-shaped steel struts. A flexible posterior membrane enables dynamic compression during cough, whilst the clasps maintain the airway lumen in the face of external compression. The design of the stent cast was based upon computed tomographic (CT)-scan studies of the central airways. Its complex shape provides a smoother distribution of pressure on the mucosa; thereby, lowering the stimulus for granulation formation. The bronchial limbs saddle on the carina, preventing displacement. The mechanical behaviours of the new stent and two commercially available stents were compared in an ex-vivo model, utilizing freshly excised tracheae and new visualization techniques. Dynamic (artificial coughs) and static loads (simulating tumour compression or pleural pressures) were applied on excised human tracheae with different stents. Our dynamic stent preserved effective compression of the posterior membrane in response to cough, and also provided lumen stability against extrinsic compression. In comparison, the two commercially available stents did not provide both functions equally well. In conclusion, our newly designed dynamic bifurcation stent shows characteristics which should prove useful in avoiding problems currently associated with airway stents."

During the early 1900's, Killian published extensively and lectured throughout the world.

Once the uvula is visualized the dominant hand holding the rigid scope and camera should be lowered using the thumb as a fulcrum and advanced further until the epiglottis is seen. The bevel of the rigid scope should then be used in a similar fashion as a Miller laryngoscope to lift the epiglottis anteriorly exposing the arytenoids, vocal cords and the glottis. If the patient's glottis  is  anterior  the  thumb  should be used to apply anterior and upward force on the rigid scope to expose the glottis.

Disadvantages include the ability to only use 100% oxygen (unless an ambient air blender is available) as well as difficulty in oxygenating and ventilating sicker patients with severe parenchymal or obstructive lung disease.",
          "echniques can be utilized at this time and depends on the category of CAO encountered; extrinsic, intrinsic or mixed. For pure extrinsic compression without any mucosal or endobronchial involvement therapeutic intervention relies on CRE balloon and rigid dilation followed by silicone or covered metal stent placement to maintain a patent airway.",

When using the flexible bronchoscope, care must be taken to have the probe protrude outside the distal tip of the scope, so as not to freeze the video chip.",
          "he length of the stent or have an hourglass shape with a narrow central portion allowing optimal positioning around a stenotic airway. Silicone stents can also have one end with a smaller diameter for optimal positioning. Y stents come with multiple various tracheal and bronchial limb diameters. These stents generally come in a uniform length, which can be adjusted at that time of insertion by shortening each of the three limbs to the desired length using a scalpel during the procedure. Other modifications can also be made at the time of insertion including the cutting of holes to allow ventilation of lobar bronchi covered by the stent during placement. Silicone stents can be made of transparent nonradio opaque material, or melted with barium sulfate, which are white in color, non-transparent but radio-opaque (27).",
          "size similar to the largest external diameter of the rigid bronchoscope used to maximally dilate the lesion in question. There are also commercially available stent sizers that can be placed down a rigid scope and used to measure the diameter of the stenotic airway. Once an appropriate size  has  been  determined  the  length  of  the  lesion should be measured using the rigid camera or flexible bronchoscope with the stent extending about 5-10 mm proximal and distal to the lesion. In sizing stents for fistulas, one should slightly oversize the stent as there is no endobronchial lesion to anchor the stent to, making migration more likely (27).",
          "onger limb of the Y stent or alternatively the mainstem with the more stenotic airway. In this technique a rigid bronchoscope must be used and intubation of the right or left mainstem must be possible. Once the mainstem has been intubated the stent deployment device is inserted into the bronchoscope and the stent is pushed out of the device. As the stent is being deployed the rigid scope is slowly withdrawn back into the trachea until the stent is fully out of the deployer. The rigid telescopes as well as forceps are then used to pull the stent back gently from the mainstem it was deployed in, allowing the shorter limb to fall into place in the contralateral bronchus. Again rotation of the stent may be necessary to allow snug seating on the carina.",
