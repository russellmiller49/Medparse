    "abstract": "BACKGROUND The use of local consolidative therapy (LCT) in patients with oligometastatic nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is rapidly evolving, with a preponderance of data supporting the beneﬁts of such therapeutic approaches incorporating pulmonary resection for appropriately selected candidates. However, practices vary widely institutionally and regionally, and evidencebased guidelines are lacking.\nMETHODS The Society of Thoracic Surgeons assembled a panel of thoracic surgical oncologists to evaluate and synthesize the available evidence regarding the role of pulmonary resection as LCT. Clinical and research questions of interest were identiﬁed, and a complete literature review was conducted. Best practice guidelines were developed accordingly.\nRESULTS The panel identiﬁed 7 areas of controversy, and data were assimilated to support the best recommended practices related to these clinical issues. Ultimately, a number of issues in this realm were found to have a high level of evidence to support the role for surgical therapy in patients with stage IV lung cancer. However, the nuances of how these operations are conducted remain in equipoise, without ample evidence to support the extent of resection or nodal dissection.\nCONCLUSIONS Clear data exist to support the use of surgical resection of the primary lung tumor as LCT in stage IV lung cancer.

Class I (strong) recommendations support consideration of pulmonary resection as a local therapeutic modality in oligometastatic Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). All patients with oligometastatic Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) should undergo a multidisciplinary evaluation, including consultation with an appropriately experienced thoracic surgeon. Additional recommendations (moderate) include performing pulmonary resection for appropriately selected patients with > 3 sites of disease as well as for select cohorts with oligoprogressive disease. Insuf /uniFB01 cient evidence exists to support recommendations regarding the bene /uniFB01 t of formal systematic mediastinal lymphadenectomy, the optimal extent of pulmonary resection (ie, lobectomy or anatomic resection vs parenchymalsparing techniques), and surgical approach (thoracotomy vs minimally invasive approaches such as video-assisted or robotic-assisted thoracoscopy)."

Prevailing retrospective data are compelling for surgery while notably susceptible to potential selection bias. Consequently, further investigation is warranted based on existing data in the pursuit of stronger evidence-based recommendations regarding several of the prioritized study questions. Given that most randomized trials in this space include radiotherapy, with or without surgery, evidence for surgery has been slower to accumulate. Nonetheless, the body of evidence for surgery continues to grow, and there exist clear potential advantages of surgical resection in the opportunity for pathologic assessment and patient-reported outcomes that render pulmonary resection an important consideration in patient care and ongoing trials."

However, advances in systemic options, including the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapies for patients with actionable mutations, have resulted in substantial improvements in disease control and overall survival. 1-5 Systemic therapy remains the cornerstone of treatment in stage IV Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), yet recent data have clearly shown that appropriately selected patients may achieve signi /uniFB01 cant improvement in outcomes with LCT, which may be comprised of surgical resection and/or radiotherapy to the primary tumor and metastatic sites of spread. 6-9"

The concept of oligoprogressive disease centers around the notion that heterogeneity in the foci of disease may render progressive lesions resistant to previous or current systemic therapy and that if one can remove those resistant cells and prevent their downstream growth, the remainder of disease may be adequately treated with systemic therapy.

However, practices vary widely institutionally and regionally, and evidencebased guidelines are lacking.\nMETHODS The Society of Thoracic Surgeons assembled a panel of thoracic surgical oncologists to evaluate and synthesize the available evidence regarding the role of pulmonary resection as LCT. Clinical and research questions of interest were identiﬁed, and a complete literature review was conducted. Best practice guidelines were developed accordingly.\nRESULTS The panel identiﬁed 7 areas of controversy, and data were assimilated to support the best recommended practices related to these clinical issues. Ultimately, a number of issues in this realm were found to have a high level of evidence to support the role for surgical therapy in patients with stage IV lung cancer. However, the nuances of how these operations are conducted remain in equipoise, without ample evidence to support the extent of resection or nodal dissection.\nCONCLUSIONS Clear data exist to support the use of surgical resection of the primary lung tumor as LCT in stage IV lung cancer. Evidence-based recommendations have been provided to guide multidisciplinary teams on the implementation of treatment plans as well as to guide researchers on areas of ongoing need for further investigation.",

The initial report, typically based on the primary end point, may be published when key planned co-primary or secondary analyses are not yet available. Clinical Trial Updates provide an opportunity to disseminate additional results from studies, published in</i> JCO <i>or elsewhere, for which the primary end point has already been reported.</i>We report 5-year efficacy and safety outcomes from the phase III KEYNOTE-407 study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02775435). Eligible patients with previously untreated, metastatic squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were randomly assigned 1:1 to pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo plus carboplatin and paclitaxel/nab-paclitaxel once every 3 weeks for four cycles, followed by pembrolizumab or placebo for up to 35 cycles. Primary end points were overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST version 1.1 by blinded independent central review (BICR). Five hundred fifty-nine patients were randomly assigned in the intention-to-treat population (pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, n = 278; placebo plus chemotherapy, n = 281). The median time from random assignment to data cutoff was 56.9 (range, 49.9-66.2) months. OS and PFS were improved with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy versus placebo plus chemotherapy (hazard ratio [95% CI], 0.71 [0.59 to 0.85] and 0.62 [0.52 to 0.74]), with 5-year OS rates of 18.4% versus 9.7%, respectively. Toxicity was manageable. Among 55 patients who completed 35 cycles of pembrolizumab, the objective response rate was 90.9% and the 3-year OS rate after completion of 35 cycles (approximately 5 years after random assignment) was 69.5%. Pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy maintained an OS and PFS benefit versus placebo plus chemotherapy in previously untreated, metastatic squamous NSCLC and is a standard-of-care first-line treatment option for metastatic squamous NSCLC regardless of programmed death ligand 1 expression."

        "abstract": "Patients with stage IV metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are generally believed to have an incurable disease. Patients with oligometastatic disease represent a distinct subset of patients among those with metastatic disease. There is evidence that these patients have synchronous or metachronous satellite nodules in different pulmonary lobes or have solitary extrapulmonary metastases. In these cases, evidence has shown that surgical resection may provide patients with survival benefit. This article discusses the biology of the oligometastatic state in patients with lung cancer and the selection of patients for surgery, as well as the prognostic factors that influence survival of the patient. To properly select patients for an aggressive local treatment regime, accurate clinical staging is of prime importance. The use of FDG-PET should be considered for restaging if oligometastatic disease is suspected based on a patient's CT scan. A limitation of retrospective clinical studies for oligometastatic disease is that it is difficult to summarize and evaluate the available evidence for the effectiveness of surgical resection due to selection bias, and to a high degree of variability among different clinical studies. Nevertheless, we can certainly learn from the clinical experience acquired from retrospective case series to identify prognostic factors. Following surgical resection, the overall 5-year actuarial survival rate is about 28% for patients with satellite nodules and 21% for patients with ipsilateral nodules. Patients with resected brain metastasis achieve 5-year survival rates between 11% and 30%, and those with adrenalectomy for adrenal metastasis achieve 5-year survival rates of 26%."

Evidence documenting the existence of selective reporting and excessive duplication of reviews on the same or similar topics is accumulating and many calls have been made in support of the documentation and public availability of review protocols. Several efforts have emerged in recent years to rectify these problems, including development of an international register for prospective reviews (PROSPERO) and launch of the first open access journal dedicated to the exclusive publication of systematic review products, including protocols (BioMed Central's Systematic Reviews). Furthering these efforts and building on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines, an international group of experts has created a guideline to improve the transparency, accuracy, completeness, and frequency of documented systematic review and meta-analysis protocols--PRISMA-P (for protocols) 2015. The PRISMA-P checklist contains 17 items considered to be essential and minimum components of a systematic review or meta-analysis protocol.This PRISMA-P 2015 Explanation and Elaboration paper provides readers with a full understanding of and evidence about the necessity of each item as well as a model example from an existing published protocol. This paper should be read together with the PRISMA-P 2015 statement. Systematic review authors and assessors are strongly encouraged to make use of PRISMA-P when drafting and appraising review protocols."

Systematic reviews are subject to a range of biases and increasingly include non-randomised studies of interventions. It is important that users can distinguish high quality reviews. Many instruments have been designed to evaluate different aspects of reviews, but there are few comprehensive critical appraisal instruments. AMSTAR was developed to evaluate systematic reviews of randomised trials. In this paper, we report on the updating of AMSTAR and its adaptation to enable more detailed assessment of systematic reviews that include randomised or non-randomised studies of healthcare interventions, or both. With moves to base more decisions on real world observational evidence we believe that AMSTAR 2 will assist decision makers in the identification of high quality systematic reviews, including those based on non-randomised studies of healthcare interventions<i>.</i>"

        "abstract": "Guideline development processes vary substantially, and many guidelines do not meet basic quality criteria. Standards for guideline development can help organizations ensure that recommendations are evidence-based and can help users identify high-quality guidelines. Such organizations as the U.S. Institute of Medicine and the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence have developed recommendations to define trustworthy guidelines within their locales. Many groups charged with guideline development find the lengthy list of standards developed by such organizations to be aspirational but infeasible to follow in entirety. Founded in 2002, the Guidelines International Network (G-I-N) is a network of guideline developers that includes 93 organizations and 89 individual members representing 46 countries. The G-I-N board of trustees recognized the importance of guideline development processes that are both rigorous and feasible even for modestly funded groups to implement and initiated an effort toward consensus about minimum standards for high-quality guidelines. In contrast to other existing standards for guideline development at national or local levels, the key components proposed by G-I-N will represent the consensus of an international, multidisciplinary group of active guideline developers. This article presents G-I-N's proposed set of key components for guideline development. These key components address panel composition, decision-making process, conflicts of interest, guideline objective, development methods, evidence review, basis of recommendations, ratings of evidence and recommendations, guideline review, updating processes, and funding. It is hoped that this article promotes discussion and eventual agreement on a set of international standards for guideline development."

The oligometastatic state-&#x2264;5 extrathoracic metastatic lesions in &#x2264;3 organs-is present in ~25% of patients with stage IV disease and is associated with markedly improved outcomes. We retrospectively identified patients with extrathoracic oligometastatic NSCLC who underwent primary tumor resection at our institution from 2000 to 2018. Event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Factors associated with EFS and OS were determined using Cox regression. In total, 111 patients with oligometastatic NSCLC underwent primary tumor resection; 87 (78%) had a single metastatic lesion. Local consolidative therapy for metastases was performed in 93 patients (84%). Seventy-seven patients experienced recurrence or progression. The five-year EFS was 19% (95% confidence interval (CI), 12-29%), and the five-year OS was 36% (95% CI, 27-50%). Factors independently associated with EFS were primary tumor size (hazard ratio (HR), 1.15 (95% CI, 1.03-1.29); <i>p =</i> 0.014) and lymphovascular invasion (HR, 1.73 (95% CI, 1.06-2.84); <i>p =</i> 0.029). Factors independently associated with OS were neoadjuvant therapy (HR, 0.43 (95% CI, 0.24-0.77); <i>p =</i> 0.004), primary tumor size (HR, 1.18 (95% CI, 1.02-1.35); <i>p =</i> 0.023), pathologic nodal disease (HR, 1.83 (95% CI, 1.05-3.20); <i>p =</i> 0.033), and visceral-pleural invasion (HR, 1.93 (95% CI, 1.10-3.40); <i>p =</i> 0.022). Primary tumor resection represents an important treatment option in the multimodal management of extrathoracic oligometastatic NSCLC. Encouraging long-term survival can be achieved in carefully selected patients, including those who received neoadjuvant therapy and those with limited intrathoracic disease."

The effects of pulmonary surgery and surgical procedures on lung cancer-specific survival (LCSS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed, and the COX regression models were employed to evaluate the survival of primary surgery in patients with primary metastatic NSCLC (pmNSCLC) and the survival of surgical procedure in pmNSCLC patients. <b>Results:</b> A total of 55,717 patients diagnosed with pmNSCLC between 2010 and 2015 were enrolled, and pulmonary surgery was indicated in 1,575 (2.83%) patients. Surgery was an independent risk factor for LCSS (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001, HR 0.658, 95%CI: 0.637-0.680) and OS (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001, HR 0.665, 95%CI: 0.644-0.686) of pmNSCLC patients. The surgery was associated with better OS (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001, HR 0.678, 95%CI: 0.657-0.699). The site of metastasis was also related to the survival after primary tumor surgery (<i>P</i> = 0.001). As compared to the sublobectomy and pneumonectomy, lobectomy improved the LCSS for NSCLC patients with single-organ metastasis, rather than multiple metastases (<i>P</i> &lt; 0.001). In patients receiving sublobectomy, lobectomy, and pneumonectomy, the median LCSS was 12, 28, and 13 months, respectively, and the 5-year LCSS rate was 14.39, 32.06, and 17.24%, respectively. <b>Conclusion:</b> The effect of locoregional surgery on the survival of pmNSCLC patients with single-organ metastasis has been underestimated, and lobectomy may be a preferred treatment for patients with single-lung metastasis."

We recently reported a phase II trial showing that, for patients with molecularly unselected oligometastatic NSCLC who did not progress after first-line systemic therapy, local consolidation therapy (LCT) with surgery or radiation improved progression-free survival (PFS), compared with maintenance therapy alone. Herein, we report a retrospective analysis of LCT after TKI in patients with metastatic EGFR mutant NSCLC."

With the development of improved immunotherapy and targeted therapy, NSCLC prognoses have significantly improved. In recent years, the concept of oligometastatic disease has been developed, with randomized trial data showing survival benefits from local ablation therapy (LAT) in patients with oligometastatic NSCLC (OM-NSCLC). LAT includes surgery, stereotactic ablation body radiation therapy, or thermal ablation, and is becoming an important treatment component for OM-NSCLC. However, controversy remains on specific management strategies for the condition. In this review, we gathered current randomized trial data to analyze prognostic factors affecting patient survival, and explored ideal treatment conditions for patients with OM-NSCLC with respect to long-term survival."

        "abstract": "Oligometastatic disease in lung cancer is not a rare condition as previously thought. Among 812 non-small cell lung cancer patients treated surgically with lung resection between October 2011 and October 2018 at the Department of Thoracic Surgery, Florence Nightingale Hospitals, Turkey, 28 patients (3.4%) had synchronous cranial metastases. We analyzed synchronous isolated cranial metastases patients treated by locally ablative treatments (surgery, radiotherapy, or both). Metastases existing at the diagnosis of primary cancer were considered as synchronous, and their treatment was performed before (at least 1 month) or after (for maximum 1 month) surgery of the primary lung lesion. Prognostic factors affecting survival are evaluated retrospectively to identify clinical factors predicting survival in an effort to better select patients for surgery. Patients having T1-T2 primary lung tumors, no mediastinal lymph node metastasis, receiving minor anatomical lung resection, receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy, having single cranial metastasis, and receiving surgical cranial metastasectomy were found to have better survival. According to tumor histology, having adenocarcinoma, and not having lymphovascular or visceral pleura invasion correlated with better survival. Average survival time was 52.1 months and median survival was 32 months. The last mortality during the follow-up was at 24 months; cumulative survival was 48.3% at that time. Our study was designed to define the criteria for patients with oligometastatic disease who may benefit from lung resection."

Given that in the oligometastatic state gross tumors represent the full extent of disease, there may be a role for curative local therapy despite metastatic disease. As nearly 60% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) present with metastatic disease and another 45% of patients with initially localized disease will ultimately develop distant metastases, NSCLC represents a prime disease for aggressive intervention. In this review, the definition, prognostic factors, patient selection, rationale and evidence for treatment of oligoprogressive and oligometastatic NSCLC is discussed, including recent prospective trials and future directions."

Preoperative evaluation determines whether a patient is both fit enough for surgery and has disease that is actually resectable. Both components are necessary for patients who undergo resection with curative intent. In general, to be considered for pulmonary metastasectomy, patients must fit the following criteria: the primary disease site and any extrathoracic disease are both controlled; complete resection of pulmonary involvement is achievable with adequate pulmonary reserve; and there are no effective medical therapies."

        "abstract": "<i>Background and Objectives:</i> For persons with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the accompanying systemic inflammatory conditions often insidiously damage extra-glandular organs, causing poor outcomes. Despite evidence manifesting the application of rehabilitation services (RSs), the association between RSs use and changes in the inflammatory response among persons with RA has not yet been established. With that in mind, this study aimed to evaluate changes in C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) before and after long-term RSs use. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> For this two-group pre and posttest study, medical data of 4505 persons with RA aged 20-70 years between 2012 and 2017 were retrieved from an electronic medical record database held by a hospital in Taiwan. Of them, 1387 subjects were categorized as RSs users, who received RSs at least six times within the first year of RA onset. Generalized estimating equations analysis was then employed to compare the changes in ESR and CRP at baseline, and at 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months after RA onset. <i>Results:</i> After adjusting for inherent differences and mature impact, those receiving standard care plus RSs were found to have a lower CRP level than those without receiving RSs. This benefit was maintained within a 3-year follow-up period. Additionally, a slight but nonsignificant reduction in ESR existed over the same timeframe. <i>Conclusions:</i> Integrating RSs into conventional care may be helpful to modulate the inflammation for RA patients, but further research via randomized controlled trials is needed to validate the application of RSs."

          "omprehensive LCT, completed trials to date allowed for treatment of primary lesions with radiotherapy or surgical therapy. Prevailing retrospective data are compelling for surgery while notably susceptible to potential selection bias. Consequently, further investigation is warranted based on existing data in the pursuit of stronger evidence-based recommendations regarding several of the prioritized study questions. Given that most randomized trials in this space include radiotherapy, with or without surgery, evidence for surgery has been slower to accumulate. Nonetheless, the body of evidence for surgery continues to grow, and there exist clear potential advantages of surgical resection in the opportunity for pathologic assessment and patient-reported outcomes that render pulmonary resection an important consideration in patient care and ongoing trials.",
