MT can also be offered upfront if an exudative effusion is suspected. The use of ultrasonography for assessing pleural effusions has become common practice, and the newly published DUETS score [5 & ] can effectively differentiate between transudates and exudates, which may eliminate the need for initial pleural fluid analysis. Therapeutically, MT is used to perform talc pleurodesis to prevent recurrence of pleural effusion",

TTP has a high efficacy in achieving pleurodesis with success rates between 80% and 90% [29,30]. Although talc slurry via chest tube can achieve similar success [6 & ], MT allows for talc to be administered upfront during the initial diagnostic procedure. It also allows for identification of a nonexpandable lung. Presence of a thick fibrous peel, multiple adhesions and failure of lung expansion intra-procedure would signify a trapped lung for whichanIPCcanbeinsertedinstead.Several authors have recently described the combined procedure of TTPfollowed by IPC insertion, overcoming the problem of lengthy hospital stay associated with the former and lower pleurodesis rates with the latter. Most patients could be discharged on the same day, with high success rates at 6 months [31,32].

        "abstract": "Thoracoscopy is an increasingly common procedure that provides significant clinical information and therapeutic applications. The procedure allows the physician to biopsy the parietal pleura under direct visualization with high accuracy. In addition, one can drain pleural fluid, place a chest tube in a precise location, and perform poudrage pleurodesis. Medical thoracoscopy (MT) is carried out in the operating room or procedure suite under moderate sedation with spontaneous ventilation. In comparison, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is performed under general anesthesia with single lung ventilation and through multiple ports in the operating room. MT is less invasive, has a comparable diagnostic yield, and may be better tolerated in high-risk patients. The indications, complications, and advances in thoracoscopy will be discussed in this article. In the era of rapidly evolving therapeutics for lung cancer, immune-modulation and ever-increasing risks of immunosuppression, MT will evolve and continue to play a pivotal role in the evaluation and research of pleuropulmonary diseases."

We sought to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the relatively new technique of semirigid thoracoscopy in PEUE through this systematic review."

The cytopathologic correlation was 96.5% accurate, with 0.1% false-positive results and 0.18% false-negative results by cytology. The sensitivity of cytologic detections was 6.7% higher than that of pleural biopsy. Frequency analysis showed that the incidence of carcinoma of the lung, the most common cause of malignant effusion, is not sex based. Adenocarcinoma of the lung was the most frequent type of malignancy found in pleural effusions. It represented 79% of lung carcinomas that metastasized to pleura, accounting for 40% of all malignant pleural effusions. In young adults, lymphoreticular malignancies were the most common cause of malignant effusions."

        "abstract": "Multiple fluid specimens of a patient are often received in the cytology laboratory. Both clinicians and pathologists question the optimal number of specimens required to detect a malignancy. We reviewed the computerized cytology files at Boston's Beth Israel Hospital from 1988 to 1991 to identify patients with two or more specimens from the same anatomic site. Two hundred and fifteen patients with a total of 570 specimens were identified. Before December 19, 1990, two direct smears were examined per fluid sample. After December 19, 1990, two direct smears and two cytospin preparations were examined. Medical records of patients without a positive diagnosis of cytology were reviewed. Overall, a cytological diagnosis of malignancy was made on at least one specimen for 55 patients (26%). The first positive diagnosis was made on the initial specimen in 36 patients (65%), on the second in 15 patients (27%), the third in three patients (5%), and the fifth in one patient (2%). For those specimens prepared with the two techniques described above (two direct and two concentrated smears), the first positive diagnosis was made on the initial specimen in 89% of the cases. Medical record review uncovered 55 additional patients who had clinical evidence of malignancy. Of these, 22 (40%) had at least one suspicious diagnosis of their fluid specimens. The first suspicious diagnosis was made with three or fewer specimens in all 22 patients. The majority of malignant effusions are detected with two specimens. Examination of more than three specimens is of little value. Multiple preparatory, especially concentration, techniques may increase the probability of detecting malignancy in one specimen."

The present study aimed to assess the efficacy of medical thoracoscopy (MT) in the diagnosis of patients with MPE induced by NHL. Between July 2005 and June 2014, 833 patients with pleural effusions of unknown etiology underwent MT in Beijing Chaoyang Hospital (Beijing, China), where diagnostic thoracocentesis or/and blind pleural biopsy had failed to yield an answer. Demographic, radiographic, thoracoscopic, histological and immunophenotyping data of 10 NHL patients with MPE were then retrospectively analyzed. Under medical thoracoscopy, pleural nodules (in n=6 patients), hyperemia (n=5), plaque-like lesions (n=4), pleural thickening (n=3), cellulose (n=3), ulcer (n=2), adhesion (n=2), and scattered hemorrhagic spots (n=1) were observed on the surface of parietal pleura. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis of pleural biopsy samples led to a correct diagnosis of B-cell NHL in 7 patients and T-lymphoblastic NHL in 2 patients. Data from the present study demonstrated that pleural biopsy through MT achieved a definite diagnosis of NHL in 9 out of 10 (90%) patients with MPE induced by NHL. Therefore, MT is a useful method for diagnosing MPE induced by NHL."

In 2008, the European Respiratory Society/European Society of Thoracic Surgeons Task Force brought together experts to propose practical and up-to-dated guidelines on the management of MPM. To obtain an earlier and reliable diagnosis of MPM, the experts recommend performing thoracoscopy, except in cases of pre-operative contraindication or pleural symphysis. The standard staining procedures are insufficient in approximately 10% of cases. Therefore, we propose using specific immunohistochemistry markers on pleural biopsies. In the absence of a uniform, robust and validated staging system, we advice use of the most recent TNM based classification, and propose a three step pre-treatment assessment. Patient's performance status and histological subtype are currently the only prognostic factors of clinical importance in the management of MPM. Other potential parameters should be recorded at baseline and reported in clinical trials. MPM exhibits a high resistance to chemotherapy and only a few patients are candidates for radical surgery. New therapies and strategies have been reviewed. Because of limited data on the best combination treatment, we emphasise that patients who are considered candidates for a multimodal approach should be included in a prospective trial at a specialised centre."

In the majority of patients with malignant pleural diseases, the endoscopic appearance of pleural lesions during white light thoracoscopy is suggestive of malignancy, but could be misleading in some cases. The aim of the present study was to estimate whether the combination of thoracoscopy with autofluorescence modalities would be useful to further improve the diagnostic accuracy of the conventional method. The present study displays early results of thoracoscopy performed consecutively with a normal light source and with autofluorescence light in 24 patients with exudative pleural effusion during 2003-2004. In all cases of malignant pleuritis (carcinoma or mesothelioma), the colour of the affected area of the pleura changed from white/pink to red (sensitivity 100%). However, in two cases of chronic pleuritis, a colour change from white/pink to orange/red was recorded (specificity 75%). In conclusion, the calculated positive predictive value of colour change for malignant pleuritis during autofluorescence thoracoscopy in this study was 92%. However, the clinical value of autofluorescence thoracoscopy in daily practice remains to be proven."

        "abstract": "The distinction between malignant mesothelioma and reactive mesothelial proliferation can be challenging both on histology and cytology. Recently, variants of the BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) gene resulting in nuclear protein loss were reported in hereditary and sporadic mesothelioma. Using immunohistochemistry, we evaluated the utility of BAP1 expression in the differential diagnosis between mesothelioma and other mesothelial proliferations on a large series of biopsies that included 212 mesotheliomas, 12 benign mesothelial tumors, and 42 reactive mesothelial proliferations. BAP1 stain was also performed in 70 cytological samples (45 mesotheliomas and 25 reactive mesothelial proliferations). BAP1 was expressed in all benign mesothelial tumors, whereas 139/212 (66%) mesotheliomas were BAP1 negative, especially in epithelioid/biphasic compared with sarcomatoid/desmoplastic subtypes (69% vs 15%). BAP1 loss was homogeneous in neoplastic cells except for two epithelioid mesotheliomas showing tumor heterogeneity. By fluorescence in situ hybridization, BAP1 protein loss was paralleled by homozygous deletion of the BAP1 locus in the vast majority of BAP1-negative tumors (31/41, 76%), whereas 9/10 BAP1-positive mesotheliomas were normal. In biopsies interpreted as reactive mesothelial proliferation BAP1 loss was 100% predictive of malignancy, as all 6 cases subsequently developed BAP1-negative mesothelioma, whereas only 3/36 (8%) BAP1-positive cases progressed to mesothelioma. On cytology/cell blocks, benign mesothelial cells were invariably positive for BAP1, whereas 64% of mesotheliomas showed loss of protein; all 6 cases showing BAP1 negativity were associated with histological diagnosis of BAP1-negative mesothelioma. BAP1 stain also showed utility in the differential of mesothelioma from most common pleural and peritoneal mimickers, such as lung and ovary carcinomas, with specificity and sensitivity of 99/70% and 100/70%, respectively. Our results show that BAP1 protein is frequently lost in mesothelioma, especially of epithelioid/biphasic subtype and is commonly associated with homozygous BAP1 deletion. BAP1 immunostain represents an excellent biomarker with an unprecedented specificity (100%) in the distinction between benign and malignant mesothelial proliferations. Finding BAP1 loss in mesothelial cells should prompt to immediately reevaluate the patient; moreover, it might be useful in mapping tumor extent and planning surgical resection."

        "abstract": "<b>Background and Objective:</b> Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) often results in debilitating symptoms. Relief of dyspnoea and improvement in quality of life can be achieved with either talc pleurodesis or insertion of an indwelling tunneled pleural catheter (IPC). The former requires a lengthy hospital stay and the latter is associated with lower pleurodesis rates. In response to limited hospital bed capacity, we developed a pragmatic approach in managing MPE by combining thoracoscopic talc poudrage and insertion of IPC into a single day case procedure. We present data on the safety and efficacy of this approach. <b>Methods:</b> Patients who had undergone the abovementioned procedure between 2017 and 2020 were analyzed. Demographic data, hospital length of stay (LOS), histological diagnosis, rates of pleurodesis success and procedural related complications were collated. Patients were followed-up for 6 months. <b>Results:</b> Forty-five patients underwent the procedure. Mean age was 68.5 &#xb1; 10.4 years and 56% were male. Histological diagnosis was achieved in all cases. 86.7% of patients were discharged on the day of the procedure. Median LOS was 0 (IQR 0-0) days. Successful pleurodesis was attained in 77.8% at 6-month follow-up. No procedure related deaths or IPC related infections were recorded. <b>Conclusion:</b> Ambulatory thoracoscopic poudrage and IPC insertion is a safe and effective option in the management of MPE. All patients received a definitive pleural intervention with 77.8% pleurodesis success at 6-months and majority of them discharged on the same day. Future randomized trials are required to confirm these findings."

Improve quality of life and relieve the dyspnea are the main objectives in this palliative care setting. This can be achieved by the placement of an indwelling catheter (IPC) or talc pleurodesis ideally performed by thoracoscopy route (talc poudrage). Beside to misidentify a trapped-lung, the latter requires a prolonged hospital stay and the IPC placement does not allow a high pleurodesis rate. To overcome these drawbacks, a combination of both technique could be proposed for the management of recurrent malignant pleural effusions.

        "abstract": "In a prospective comparison, 60 patients suffering from complicated spontaneous pneumothorax were randomly allocated to receive treatment by a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) technique or by thoracotomy. Thirty patients underwent bullectomy and apical pleurectomy by VATS performed through three 2-cm incisions (group V) and 30 patients underwent a similar surgical procedure through a posterolateral thoracotomy (group T). The median operating time was significantly longer in group V (45 versus 37.5 minutes; p &lt; 0.05), but the postoperative analgesic requirement and hospital stay were less than those in group T. On the third postoperative day, the reductions in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity were significantly lower in group V than in group T (p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.01, respectively). Initial treatment of the spontaneous pneumothorax was effective in 27 patients (90%) in group V and in 29 patients (97%) in group T. There have been two late recurrences in group V and one in group T at a median follow-up of 15.1 months and 16.3 months, respectively. Within the study group, 30 consecutive patients presented with primary spontaneous pneumothorax. In this subgroup there was no significant difference in the operating time between VATS and thoracotomy, but postoperative pain, hospital stay, and pulmonary dysfunction were all less for those undergoing VATS. All treatment failures were in the subgroup of 30 consecutive patients who presented with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax, and the hospital stay in this group was prolonged by the use of VATS. We conclude from our findings that VATS is superior to thoracotomy in the treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Between January 2001 and June 2004, 208 consecutive patients (169 male and 39 female; mean (range) age 25 (12-39) yrs) were submitted to 220 video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical procedures for primary spontaneous pneumothorax. All patients underwent apical lung resection; 112 were assigned at random to mechanical pleural abrasion (group A) and 108 to apical pleurectomy (group B). The two groups of patients showed similar characteristics. No intra- or post-operative deaths occurred. Post-operative morbidity was 6.25% for group A and 12.9% for group B; the two groups exhibited a similar persistent post-operative air leak rate (5.3% in group A and 5.5% in group B), whereas haemothorax was significantly more frequent after apical pleurectomy (eight (7.4%) cases) than after pleural abrasion (one (0.9%) case). The mean duration of follow-up was 46 (24-66) months. Late recurrence occurred in five cases (4.6%) after apical pleurectomy, and in seven (6.2%) after mechanical pleural abrasion. Mechanical pleural abrasion by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery is safer than apical pleurectomy in the treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax. No differences in late recurrence rate were observed between the two procedures."

Although the optimal surgical technique is uncertain, bullous resection using staplers in combination with mechanical pleurodesis, chemical pleurodesis and/or staple line coverage is usually undertaken. Currently, patient satisfaction, postoperative pain and other perioperative parameters have significantly improved with advancements in thoracoscopic technology, which include uniportal, needlescopic and nonintubated VATS variants. Ipsilateral recurrences after VATS occur in less than 5% of patients, in which case a redo-VATS is a feasible therapeutical option. Randomized controlled trials are urgently needed to shed light on the best definitive management of SP."

We investigated the safety of large-particle talc for thoracoscopic pleurodesis to prevent recurrence of primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP). 418 patients with recurrent PSP were enrolled between 2002 and 2008 in nine centres in Europe and South Africa. The main exclusion criteria were infection, heart disease and coagulation disorders. Serious adverse events (ARDS, death or other) were recorded up to 30 days after the procedure. Oxygen saturation, supplemental oxygen use and temperature were recorded daily at baseline and after thoracoscopic pleurodesis (2 g graded talc). During the 30-day observation period following talc poudrage, no ARDS (95% CI 0.0-0.9%), intensive care unit admission or death were recorded. Seven patients presented with minor complications (1.7%, 95% CI 0.7-3.4%). After pleurodesis, mean body temperature increased by 0.41&#xb0;C (95% CI 0.33-0.48&#xb0;C; p&lt;0.001) at day 1 and returned to baseline value at day 5. Pleural drains were removed after day 4 in 80% of patients. Serious adverse events, including ARDS or death, did not occur in this large, multicentre cohort. Thoracoscopic talc poudrage using larger particle talc to prevent recurrence of PSPS can be considered safe."

        "abstract": "Tuberculous (TB) pleural effusion occurs in approximately 5% of patients with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. The HIV pandemic has been associated with a doubling of the incidence of extrapulmonary TB, which has resulted in increased recognition of TB pleural effusions even in developed nations. Recent studies have provided insights into the immunopathogenesis of pleural TB, including memory T-cell homing and chemokine activation. The definitive diagnosis of TB pleural effusions depends on the demonstration of acid-fast bacilli in the sputum, pleural fluid, or pleural biopsy specimens. The diagnosis can be established in a majority of patients from the clinical features, pleural fluid examination, including cytology, biochemistry, and bacteriology, and pleural biopsy. Measurement of adenosine deaminase and interferon-gamma in the pleural fluid and polymerase chain reaction for M tuberculosis has gained wide acceptance in the diagnosis of TB pleural effusions. Although promising, these tests require further evaluation before their routine use can be recommended. The treatment of TB pleural effusions in patients with HIV/AIDS is essentially similar to that in HIV-negative patients. At present, evidence regarding the use of corticosteroids in the treatment of TB pleural effusion is not clear-cut."

However, most high TB-incidence regions have limited financial resources, lack the infrastructure needed for routine thoracoscopy and require an alternative, cost-effective diagnostic approach for pleural effusions. Altogether, 51 patients with undiagnosed exudative pleural effusions were recruited for a prospective, direct comparison between bronchial wash, pleural fluid microbiology and biochemistry (adenosine deaminase (ADA) and cell count), closed needle biopsy, and medical thoracoscopy. The final diagnosis was TB in 42 patients (82%), malignancy in five (10%) and idiopathic in four patients (8%). Sensitivity of histology, culture and combined histology/culture was 66, 48 and 79%, respectively for closed needle biopsy and 100, 76 and 100%, respectively for thoracoscopy. Both were 100% specific. Pleural fluid ADA of &gt; or = 50 U x L(-1) was 95% sensitive and 89% specific. Combined ADA, lymphocyte/neutrophil ratio &gt; or = 0.75 plus closed needle biopsy reached 93% sensitivity and 100% specificity. A combination of pleural fluid adenosine deaminase, differential cell count and closed needle biopsy has a high diagnostic accuracy in undiagnosed exudative pleural effusions in areas with high incidences of tuberculosis and might substitute medical thoracoscopy at considerably lower expense in resource-poor countries."

        "abstract": "Pleural infections represent an important group of disorders that is characterized by the invasion of pathogens into the pleural space and the potential for rapid progression to frank empyema. Previous epidemiologic studies have indicated that empyema is increasing in prevalence, which underscores the importance of urgent diagnosis and effective drainage to improve clinical outcomes. Unfortunately, limited evidence exists to guide clinicians in selecting the ideal drainage intervention for a specific patient because of the broad variation that exists in the intrapleural extent of infection, presence of locules, comorbid features, respiratory status, and virulence of the underlying pathogen. Moreover, many patients experience delays in both the recognition of infected pleural fluid and the initiation of appropriate measures to drain the pleural space. The present review provides an update on the pathogenesis and interventional therapy of pleural infections with an emphasis on the unique role of image-guided drainage with small-bore catheters."

Limited evidence exists regarding the optimal treatment. Although both early medical thoracoscopy (MT) and tube thoracostomy with intrapleural instillation of tissue plasminogen activator and human recombinant deoxyribonuclease are acceptable treatments for patients with complicated pleural infection, there is a lack of comparative data for these modes of management.<b>Objectives:</b> The aim of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of early MT versus intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy (IPFT) in selected patients with multiloculated pleural infection and empyema.<b>Methods:</b> This was a prospective multicenter, randomized controlled trial involving patients who underwent MT or IPFT for pleural infection. The primary outcome was the length of hospital stay after either intervention. Secondary outcomes included the total length of hospital stay, treatment failure, 30-day mortality, and adverse events.<b>Results:</b> Thirty-two patients with pleural infection were included in the study. The median length of stay after an intervention was 4 days in the IPFT arm and 2 days in the MT arm (<i>P</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.026). The total length of hospital stay was 6 days in the IPFT arm and 3.5 days in MT arm (<i>P</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.12). There was no difference in treatment failure, mortality, or adverse events between the treatment groups, and no serious complications related to either intervention were recorded.<b>Conclusions:</b> When used early in the course of a complicated parapneumonic effusion or empyema, MT is safe and might shorten hospital stays for selected patients as compared with IPFT therapy. A multicenter trial with a larger sample size is needed to confirm these findings.Clinical trial registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02973139)."
