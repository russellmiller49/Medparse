The incidence of PAL after lobectomy is lower, ranging from 5.6% to 26% in various reports (4,10-13). While the incidence of PAL after secondary spontaneous pneumothorax is not known, it is certainly much lower than in the setting of postoperative air-leak (9). The incidence of PAL in patients on mechanical ventilation has not been well described. Pierson et  al. reported 39 cases of PAL out of 1,700 patients (2.2%) undergoing mechanical ventilation over 4 years at a single trauma center. Average tidal volume in this cohort was 14.6 mL/kg, which is not consistent with modern practice and suggests that the rate of PAL in a similar cohort in the current decade may be even lower (14)."

LVRS patients with PAL also had increased length of hospital stay when compared to matched controls (11.8 vs. 7.6 days, P=0.0005) (4).

Data from Pierson and colleagues regarding PAL in mechanically ventilated patients did demonstrate significant mortality in those patients with PAL. Mortality in this cohort was 67%, and in those patients who were not victims of trauma mortality was 92%. Larger volumes of air leak per breath were also associated with increased observed mortality in this cohort (14). The generalizability of this prognostic data to a broader population, particularly in the current age of low tidal volume ventilation, is questionable. However, it seems likely that the presence of a PAL in mechanically ventilated patients would at the very least increase length of stay and health care costs as it has been shown to do in postsurgical patients."

Based on expert consensus, they recommend thoracic surgical consultation if the air-leak persists beyond 4 days, and they recommend medical pleurodesis if  the  patient  is  not  a  surgical candidate (16). The most recent British Thoracic Society pleural disease guideline on spontaneous pneumothorax also briefly discusses PAL. Their recommendation is for surgical consultation if the air-leak persists beyond 48 hours. In patients who are medically inoperable they recommend chemical pleurodesis or chest tube with one-way flutter valve  as  alternatives  (7).

Medical pleurodesis may not be ideal or effective for patients who have air-leaks so brisk that visceral and parietal pleural apposition is not achievable. Maintaining an intrapleural catheter with a one-way flutter valve may also allow for outpatient management in some patients, but the risk of pleural space infection is increased and some degree of social support is needed for optimal care of the chest tube (17,18). Conservative management with chest tube placement and observation is often the initial choice and is usually effective (2). When this approach fails management strategies are generally divided into surgical and nonsurgical approaches, including bronchoscopic techniques. Overall goals of treatment are to maintain acceptable oxygenation and ventilation, to decrease or resolve the air leak allowing for full lung expansion if possible, to decrease length of stay, and to prevent recurrence of the air leak and subsequent pneumothorax."

            "text": "Conservative management of a PAL generally consists of chest tube drainage and observation. There is not a current consensus on whether or not placing the chest tube to suction delays the time needed for the fistulous tract to heal. Some authors contend that water seal rather than active suction promotes healing of the alveolar-pleural fistula in pneumothorax by decreasing flow of air through the defect and thereby improving apposition of the lung tissue (19-21). Others believe that applying suction removes air from the pleural space at a rate greater than that of air leakage via the visceral pleural defect, promoting apposition between the visceral and parietal pleura thus enhancing healing (7,21). Trials in the surgical literature that have evaluated suction vs water seal for post-operative air-leaks have yielded conflicting results, although it must also be noted that in these trials the air leaks were not necessarily persistent. Cerfolio et  al. evaluated 33 patients with air leaks on the second post-operative day after lung resection. They were randomized to water seal or continuous suction (-20 cmH 2 O). The air leaks of the patients placed on water seal were more likely to resolve by post-operative day 3 than those on suction, although patients with very brisk leaks (33%) did not resolve on water seal alone (22). Brunelli and colleagues randomized 145 patients with post-lobectomy air leaks on the first post-operative day to receive water seal or continuous suction (-20 cmH 2O).

Drawbacks of this approach include discomfort with prolonged chest tube, increased risk of pleural infection, malfunction or malposition of the valve leading to reaccumulation of pneumothorax with tension, and patient dissatisfaction with fluid leaking from the drainage system (17,18,25,26). Other elements of conservative management include management of pleural of pulmonary infection, treatment of the underlying disorder causing the PAL, and adequate nutritional support to promote healing (27)."

            "text": "Predicting when conservative management is likely to fail may be useful in that it allows the treating physician to intervene earlier to palliate the air-leak and reduce hospital length of stay and costs. Several studies of post-operative patients have evaluated risk factors for PAL after lobectomy or LVRS (3,4,10,11). These are most useful in identifying those patients at high risk for PAL who may benefit from prophylactic intraoperative strategies to reduce that risk. They are not as helpful in deciding if a given leak is likely to become persistent once it has developed (28). More useful in this regard may be using newer chest drainage systems that allow for digital measurement of air-leak flow. Brunelli and colleagues demonstrated that measurements of air leak flow and intrapleural pressures using such a device 6 hours after lobectomy could aid in estimating the risk of PAL (29). Pilot studies of digital chest drainage systems in both surgical and non-surgical pneumothorax patients have also demonstrated their utility in helping clinicians decide when to remove chest tubes by quantifying the amount of airleak (28,30). The ability of such digital drainage systems to not only measure the rate of air leak but monitor its change over time may allow physicians to predict which air leaks are likely to resolve without intervention and which ones are more likely to benefit most from early active management. Prospective controlled trials are still needed to validate this hypothesis."

            "text": "Surgical management of PAL has long been the mainstay of therapy in those patients in whom air leaks do not resolve using conservative means. However, our aging population is slowly decreasing the number of patients who are fit for surgery. A number of surgical approaches have been described, varying somewhat with the underlying cause of the air leak. In post-surgical air leaks, drainage of  any  empyema with reinforcement of the stump or area of resection are typical (27). The reported rate of successful surgical treatment of postoperative PAL is between 80% and 95% (9,31-33). Of note, many patients are either not candidates for repeat surgery or prefer a  less  invasive technique. For air leaks after secondary spontaneous pneumothorax, surgical management includes resection of any blebs, bullae, or visible abnormalities of the visceral pleura as well as mechanical and/or chemical pleurodesis to achieve pleural symphysis (1,7,34). Both video assisted thorascopic surgery (VATS) and open thoracotomy are effective. Recurrence rates for secondary spontaneous pneumothorax with PAL are slightly lower with thoracotomy than VATS, but the morbidity of thoracotomy is higher (1,7). Mortality of surgical treatment of PAL is low, but morbidity is significant (7,9,34). Again, some patients are not candidates for surgical management because they are medically inoperable, because they decline surgery, or because less morbid non-surgical techniques are attempted first."

In a small series of six patients Wang et al. demonstrated a failure rate of 83% for tetracycline pleurodesis in patients with spontaneous pneumothorax with PAL (37). The largest study to date was published by Light and colleagues in 1990. They randomized 229 patients to receive either intrapleural tetracycline or  usual  care.  Results  showed  that  pleurodesis  with tetracycline did reduce the recurrence rate of spontaneous pneumothorax overall. However, analysis of the subset of 39 patients who had PAL at the time of randomization showed no benefit of tetracycline pleurodesis in those patients with air leak (38). A subsequent study of tetracycline pleurodesis for spontaneous pneumothorax found similarly disappointing results in the subgroup of patients with PAL, with a pleurodesis failure rate of 40% (39). The use of talc for medical chemical pleurodesis in patients with PAL has not been well studied, although it was shown to be more effective than tetracycline for prevention of recurrence of spontaneous pneumothorax without air leak (40). The major adverse effect of pleurodesis with tetracycline or minocycline is severe chest pain (35). Although the pain seen with talc is less severe than that seen with tetracycline, empyema is occasionally seen with talc pleurodesis, as is acute respiratory distress syndrome (Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)) (19). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in talc pleurodesis is thought to be related to extrapleural dissemination of talc when preparations containing smaller size particles are used (41). This risk is much lower if graded talc with only larger size particles is utilized (42)."

With the continued rapid development of more advanced therapeutic  bronchoscopic  techniques  the  role  of bronchoscopy in the management of PAL has expanded dramatically. Nevertheless, the first step and probably the most crucial one remains the accurate localization of the air leak. This is generally the most tedious but important step in bronchoscopic treatment of PAL, no matter which therapeutic technique is utilized. It is frequently the case that more than one segment or even lobe are contributing to the air leak because of distal collateral ventilation within the same lobe, incomplete fissure or the presence of multiple areas of visceral pleural damage. For this reason, a patient and systematic approach to localize the leak is important. Careful review of the patient's history, procedure or operative report, and review of computed tomography (CT) imaging may help guide this process."

Once  anesthesia  is  induced  the pleural vacuum drain or digital chest drain is positioned so that it can be observed by the bronchoscopy team during balloon occlusion. Then a balloon catheter is advanced through the working channel of the flexible bronchoscope and positioned initially in a proximal airway ipsilateral to the air leak. Most bronchoscopists begin with a lobar bronchus, though on the right side the starting point could be the right bronchus intermedius. Once the balloon is inflated and the selected bronchus is"

If the air leak lessens or stops with occlusion of the first bronchus, the balloon is deflated and then positioned in each more distal segment until the leak is fully localized. It should be the goal of the bronchoscopists to resolve the leak blocking the least amount of bronchial segments. If the leak does not change during the initial occlusion, a  different  lobar  bronchus is  chosen and the process is  repeated  until  the  leak  is  localized.  Of  note,  the air  leak  may  not  change  immediately after occlusion of  the  affected  lobe  because  the  air  remaining  in  the unventilated portion of the lung gradually leaks out with each breath. It is important therefore to keep the balloon inflated long enough to give the leak a chance to decrease before moving on to the next area."

            "text": "In some cases, the air leak becomes intermittent or ceases after anesthesia is induced for bronchoscopy, making localization using selective bronchial occlusion impossible. The reasons for this phenomena are not clear,  but  it  may  be  due  to  the  location  of  the  chest tube (i.e., posterior), the supine position of the patient, development of atelectasis after induction of anesthesia, or decreased ventilation around the bronchoscope when using a small endotracheal tube. Vial and colleagues have developed an ingenious method to overcome this situation and they have named it 'endobronchial oxygen insufflation' (49). This simple technique uses low flow oxygen insufflation to localize the site of air leak. Instead of blocking bronchi with a balloon to diminish the air leak, since there is no evident leak, they induce it by selectively insufflating oxygen in different bronchial segments. Oxygen tubing with flow set to between 2 and 4 L/min is attached to the suction valve of the flexible bronchoscope. This enables insufflation of oxygen at low flow into the bronchial tree via the working channel of the instrument. The bronchoscope is then positioned in the airways of interest and oxygen is insufflated in short (2 second) bursts by depressing the button on the suction valve of the bronchoscope. The chest drain is observed during insufflation and the presence of bubbles or an increase in the rate of flow at that time confirms the site of the air leak (49). Another alternative method of localizing the site of the leak has been reported by van Zeller et al. They were able to successfully localize the leaking portion of lung by instilling methylene blue into the chest tube and observing in which bronchopulmonary segments it appeared, allowing them to successfully treat the PAL (50)."

Reported sclerosants include ethanolamine (58), ethanol (59), and tetracycline (60). Endobronchial implants have also been used to palliate air leaks. The endobronchial Watanabe spigot is a silicone implantable bronchial filler which was developed to treat PAL. In the original trial of 60 patients with PAL 23 had a complete cessation of air leak after placement of the spigot, and 22 more had a reduction in the air leak (61). The device is somewhat cumbersome to use and has not been widely adopted. Endobronchial placement of vascular embolization coils, with and without the addition of sealant, has also been used to treat PAL with limited success (62,63). Overall results for sealants, sclerosants, and implants have been mixed, and larger comparative studies are needed to truly determine their optimal use."

Cornwell and collaborators reviewed a series of 15 patients with PAL at a large Veterans Affairs hospital, 12 of whom had large leaks and were strictly suction-dependent (patients developed large pneumothorax when placed on water seal). After treatment with a mean of 3.87 IBVs ten patients (67%) had complete resolution of their air leak within 2 days. Of the 12 patients who were suction-dependent prior to IBV placement 11 were able to be placed on water seal immediately after the valve procedure.

It is important to emphasize that even in situations where a complete resolution of the leak is not achieved, a partial response that allows to liberate patients from wall suction can be key in reducing length of stay (since patients can then be discharged with a flutter valve, for example). The largest study to date of IBV for air leaks reviewed 75 patients undergoing IBV placement at 8 centers. Off-label indications for valve placement were present in 71% of patients.

We will describe the technique for intrabronchial valve placement here since that device is approved for use in the United States as well as other countries. The procedure for placing the endobronchial valve is similar. General anesthesia and moderate sedation have both been used, though we favor the former with an endotracheal tube to allow for an airtight system. If general anesthesia is used a size 8.5 or larger endotracheal tube are recommended to prevent decrease of the air leak because of decreased ventilation around the bronchoscope within a smaller sized tube (78). Air leak isolation is completed as described above. Once the leak is isolated the airways to be blocked must be sized  in  order  to  choose  an  optimally  sized  valve  to occlude it with good fit. The IBV system comes with a balloon catheter and airway sizing calibration kit for this purpose. Once the balloon is calibrated it is advanced through the working channel of the bronchoscope into the airway to be occluded. The balloon is then inflated until it is gently touching the bronchial wall in its entire circumference. While it should be able to be moved back and forth when inflated a small amount of resistance is  felt  when the balloon is properly inflated ( Figure 2 ). Overinflating the balloon to the point of dilation or distention of the airway should be avoided as this will result in selecting an oversized valve, which will 'wrinkle' and not block air flow as effectively as one that is optimally sized. Once properly inflated the degree of inflation is recorded on the reference chart that is part of the calibration kit and the proper size valve is selected. The properly sized valve is loaded into the deployment catheter and the catheter is inspected to ensure good position and no kinking. Then the catheter is introduced via the working channel of the bronchoscope. The tip of the removal rod, which is the proximal end of the valve itself, should be just touching the tip of the stabilization wire. If there is a significant space between them, it should be removed in order to improve the accuracy of placement and prevent kinking of the catheter. This is done by removing the safety clip and gently pressing the proximal catheter handle until the gap is closed (78). This last step-'closing the gap'-is no further needed with the latest multiple valve deployment system. Subsequently, the bronchoscope and catheter are advanced into the target",

For this specific group of patients and for those who do not desire surgery, nonsurgical treatment should be offered. Pleurodesis with medicines or blood can be used, but controlled studies are lacking. Numerous bronchoscopic techniques have also been described in small case series with variable results. These include various sealants, sclerosants, and implanted devices.

Its management can be complex and challenging. Although conservative treatment with chest drain and observation is usually effective, other invasive techniques are needed when conservative treatment fails. Surgical management and medical pleurodesis have long been the usual treatments for PAL. More recently numerous bronchoscopic procedures have been introduced to treat PAL in those patients who are poor candidates for surgery or who decline surgery. These techniques include bronchoscopic use of sealants, sclerosants, and various types of implanted devices. Recently, removable one-way valves have been developed that are able to be placed bronchoscopically in the affected airways, ameliorating air-leaks in patients who are not candidates for surgery. Future comparative trials are needed to refine our understanding of the indications, effectiveness, and complications of bronchoscopic techniques for treating PAL. The following article will review the basic principles of management of PAL particularly focusing on bronchoscopic techniques.",

        "abstract": "Persistent air-leak in patients with spontaneous pneumothorax (SP) is not uncommon and may present a management dilemma in those who are unfit or unwilling for surgery. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has been advocated in the management of patients with broncho-pleural fistulae (air-leak persisting beyond 7 days): however the optimum time for surgical intervention remains unclear. We reviewed the records of 130 episodes of SP in 115 patients over a 2-year period to determine clinical course and outcome, particularly with respect to duration of air-leak. There were 90 first episodes and 40 recurrent episodes. Eighty-one episodes (62%) occurred in patients with underlying lung disease (secondary pneumothorax). Initial management consisted of chest-tube drainage in 104 episodes (80%) occurring in 90 patients, percutaneous needle aspiration in five patients (4%) and observation in 21 episodes (16%) in 20 patients. In the group treated with chest-tube drainage, there was spontaneous resolution of air leak and lung re-expansion in 90 episodes (87%). The overall incidence of broncho-pleural fistula was 34.6%. In the primary SP group. 75% of air-leaks ceased by 7 days and 100% by 15 days. In the secondary SP group, 61% of air-leaks resolved by 7 days and 79% by 14 days, after which time resolution of air-leak proceeded at a much slower rate. Five patients underwent surgery while nine patients were discharged with residual pneumothoraces. There were no major complications or mortality. Based on our findings, we advocate surgery for patients with air-leak persisting beyond 14 days, while favouring a conservative approach before this time, as the majority of air-leaks (especially in patients with primary pneumothorax) would resolve by 14 days."

Several therapies have been employed, including thoracotomy and repair of the air leak, prolonged tube thoracostomy suction, and chemical pleurodesis. We report two cases in which patients with a prolonged air leak who were not candidates for thoracotomy had immediate successful treatment with an autologous \"blood patch\" pleurodesis. An autologous blood patch pleurodesis is, in our limited experience, a simple, painless, inexpensive, and effective treatment for patients with a persistent pulmonary air leak."

The optimum time to intervene surgically is not known. We therefore investigated the rate of resolution of PAL (defined as continued air leak at 2 days after tube insertion) in patients treated medically. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 214 patients presenting with SP over 5 yr. One hundred and forty-two (67%) had tube drainage and in 73 (51%) of these a PAL developed. Overall median time to resolution in the 43 patients with PAL treated medically was 8 days from tube insertion, but PAL resolution was longer in those with underlying lung disease (n = 19) than those without such disease (11 days vs. 7 days, P = 0.05). In patients with normal lungs 20/24 had resolved by 9 days but subsequently the rate of resolution was much slower. In those with abnormal lungs only 8/19 had resolved by 9 days (P &lt; 0.05 compared with those with normal lungs) but the rate of resolution in such patients appeared to change little subsequently. The size of the initial SP did not influence the rate of resolution of PAL. For patients with PAL and normal lungs, surgery at 7-9 days from tube insertion would provide a reasonable opportunity for the PAL to resolve with medical treatment. For those with underlying lung disease there is no clear optimal time and decisions need to be taken on an individual basis."

Although rare, BPFs represent a challenging management problem and are associated with high morbidity and mortality. By far, the postoperative complication of pulmonary resection is the most common cause, followed by lung necrosis complicating infection, persistent spontaneous pneumothorax, chemotherapy or radiotherapy (for lung cancer), and tuberculosis. The treatment of BPF includes various surgical and medical procedures, and of particular interest is the use of bronchoscopy and different glues, coils, and sealants. Localization of the fistula and size may indicate potential benefits of surgical vs endoscopic procedures. In high-risk surgical patients, endoscopic procedures may serve as a temporary bridge until the patient's clinical status is improved, while in other patients endoscopic procedures may be the only option. Therapeutic success has been variable, and the lack of consensus suggests that no optimal therapy is available; rather, the current therapeutic options seem to be complementary, and the treatment should be individualized."

        "abstract": "Bronchopleural fistula (BPF), or bronchopleural air leak, is regarded as an ominous complication of ventilator management in acute respiratory failure, but data on its natural course and prognosis are lacking. We reviewed all instances of mechanical ventilation at a major trauma center during a four-year period, and found that 39 of the 1,700 mechanically-ventilated patients developed BPF lasting at least 24 hrs. Overall mortality in these 39 patients was 67 percent, and this was higher when BPF developed late in the illness (16 of 17, or 94 percent, when mean onset was hospital day 13), than when it occurred within 24 hours of admission (ten of 22, or 45 percent, p = 0.002). Survival in patients with chest trauma (12 of 27, 44 percent), most of whom had air leaks on or just after admission, was better than in those with other primary diagnoses (one of 12, 8 percent, p less than 0.005). All eight patients whose maximum air leak exceeded 500 ml per breath died, whereas 13 of 30 with smaller maximum leaks survived (p less than 0.05). Despite leaks as large as 900 ml per breath, however, conventional ventilator adjustments permitted avoidance of severe respiratory acidosis (pH less than 7.30) in all but two patients. We conclude that the occurrence of BPF during mechanical ventilation identifies patients with high mortality, but that unmanageable respiratory acidosis from this complication is rare."

        "abstract": "The Heimlich valve is a small one-way valve used for chest drainage that empties into a flexible collection device and prevents return of gases or fluids into the pleural space. The Heimlich valve is less than 13 cm (5 inches) long and facilitates patient ambulation. Currently there are several systems in the market. It can be used in many patients instead of a traditional water seal drainage system. The Heimlich chest drainage valve was developed so that the process of draining the pleural cavity could be accomplished in a safe, relatively simple, and efficient manner. This valve system has replaced the cumbersome underwater drainage bottle system. Moreover; the Heimlich valve system connects to chest tubing and allows fluid and air to pass in one direction only. This system functions in any position, and it does not ever need to be clamped, a regulated suction can be attached to it if necessary. The valve drains into a plastic bag that can be held at any level, allowing the patient undergoing chest drainage to be ambulatory simply by carrying the bag. In the current mini review we will present the Heimlich valve system and method of insertion."

These discrepancies have, in part, been driven by a paucity of high-quality evidence. Advances in diagnostic techniques have increasingly allowed the identification of lung abnormalities in patients previously labelled as having primary spontaneous pneumothorax, a group in whom recommended management differs from those with clinically apparent lung disease. Pathophysiological mechanisms underlying pneumothorax are now better understood and this may have implications for clinical management. Risk stratification of patients at baseline could help to identify subgroups at higher risk of recurrent pneumothorax who would benefit from early intervention to prevent recurrence. Further research into the roles of conservative management, Heimlich valves, digital air-leak monitoring, and pleurodesis at first presentation might lead to an increase in their use in the future."

Most of the current knowledge is extrapolated from studies performed on subjects with lung cancer. This article reviews the existing literature with particular focus on the effect of suction and no suction on the duration of air leak after lung resection and surgery for pneumothorax. Moreover, the role of regulated suction, which seems to provide some benefit in reducing pneumothorax recurrence after bullectomy and pleurodesis, is discussed. Finally, a personal view on the management of chest tubes after surgery for pneumothorax is provided."

        "abstract": "The incidence of any kind of air leaks after lung resections is reportedly around 50% of patients. The majority of these leaks doesn't require any specific intervention and ceases within a few hours or days. The recent literature defines a prolonged air leak (PAL) as an air leak lasting beyond postoperative day 5. PAL is associated with a generally worse outcome with a more complicated postoperative course anxd prolonged hospital stay and increased costs. Some authors therefore consider any PAL as surgical complication. PAL is the most prevalent postoperative complication following lung resection and the most important determinant of postoperative length of hospital stay. A low predicted postoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ppoFEV1) and upper lobe disease have been identified as significant risk factors involved in developing air leaks. Infectious conditions have also been reported to increase the risk of PAL. In contrast to the problem of PAL, there is only limited information from the literature regarding apical spaces after lung resection, probably because this common finding rarely leads to clinical consequences. This article addresses the pathogenesis of PAL and apical spaces, their prediction, prevention and treatment with a special focus on surgery for infectious conditions. Different predictive models to identify patients at higher risk for the development of PAL are provided. The discussion of surgical treatment options includes the use of pneumoperitoneum, blood patch, intrabronchial valves (IBV) and the flutter valve, and addresses the old question, whether or not to apply suction to chest tubes. The discussed prophylactic armentarium comprises of pleural tenting, prophylactic intraoperative pneumoperitoneum, sealing of the lung, buttressing of staple lines, capitonnage after resection of hydatid cysts, and plastic surgical options."

There were 36 male and 28 female patients, age range 29 to 76 years. 31 patients suffered from chronic empyema and bronchopleural fistula after lung surgery, 18 patients had chronic empyema after pulmonary inflammatory disease, and 15 patients developed a mediastinitis with or without pleural empyema after cardiac surgery or irradiation of the chest wall. The pedicled omentum was used in 33, the thoracic muscles latissimus dorsi, pectoralis major, serratus anterior, and trapezius either alone or combined in 31 cases. There were no perioperative deaths. Bronchopleural fistulas and infected spaces were successfully closed in 61 patients (95.3%). Postoperative CT scan, angiography, bronchoscopy, and lung function tests demonstrate the efficacy of both surgical methods. Omentum pedicle and thoracic muscle flaps supply excellent vascularised tissue to fill infected pleural space and mediastinum, particularly in patients with limited cardiopulmonary function."

Refinements of surgical techniques have reduced the incidence of this dreaded complication although it cannot be totally prevented. Management remains controversial. We report our recent experience of three patients with bronchopleural fistulae following a right pneumonectomy, two for bronchogenic carcinoma and another for non-tuberculous, suppurative lung disease. Our treatment of choice for these patients is, immediate pleural drainage together with parenteral broad spectrum antibiotics followed by endoscopic closure of the fistula with monomeric n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate glue (Histoacryl blue, B Braun, Melsungen, Germany). The pleural space is then irrigated with Povidone Iodine to sterility following which the closed bronchial stump is reinforced following which the closed bronchial stump is reinforced and the pleural space obliterated by decortication, omentopexy and by a tailored thoracoplasty. This cosmetically acceptable treatment produces minimal functional disability and is achieved with minimal morbidity and mortality in these critically ill patients."

Adult rabbits had a small left thoracotomy and then a 1-cm controlled cut in the lung surface. Animals served as control, or tetracycline was administered. The chest tube was removed after the air leak stopped. Animals were sacrificed after 20 days. Group A was control rabbits (6); group B had powdered tetracycline placed at thoracotomy; group C, tetracycline solution, 2 ml/kg, 25 mg/ml (4); and group D, tetracycline solution, 1 ml/kg, 50 mg/ml (10). Control rabbits showed few adhesions, and the pleura appeared to be normal by histologic examination. There was a spectrum of results with tetracycline, but with the concentrated tetracycline solution (group D) histologic examination showed uniform pleurodesis and thickening of the pleura. In group D it took no longer for the pulmonary air leak to seal than with the group A (control) rabbits. We conclude that concentrated tetracycline solution is effective in causing pleurodesis even when an active air leak is present. The lung, however, must be kept expanded so that symphysis can occur between the visceral and parietal pleura."

During the 4-year enrollment period, 113 patients were assigned to the tetracycline group; 116 patients were assigned to the control group. During the 5-year study period, the recurrence rate in the tetracycline group (25%) was significantly less than that in the control group (41%). Use of tetracycline seemed to reduce the recurrence rates for patients with either primary or secondary spontaneous pneumothorax and for patients with either an initial or a recurrent pneumothorax. We conclude that the intrapleural administration of tetracycline in patients with spontaneous pneumothorax significantly reduces the rate of ipsilateral recurrence but is associated with intense chest pain. Intrapleural tetracycline therapy is indicated for patients with a spontaneous pneumothorax who are hospitalized and are treated with tube thoracostomy."

From 1985 to the end of 1991, 78 patients were treated with tetracycline pleurodesis and 135 patients served as control subjects. Pleurodesis was induced by instillation of tetracycline and ascorbic acid through the pleural drain. The indication was any SP treated with tube thoracostomy, without active pulmonary infection. Follow-up period was from 13 to 95 months (mean, 45 months); follow-up rate was 94 percent. Post-therapy surgery was necessary for eight patients in whom pleurodesis failed due to presence of a persistent air leak. The ipsilateral recurrence rate of patients treated with TCP was 9 percent (6/66) and recurrence time ranged from 2 days to 9 months. The recurrence rate for patients treated with observation was 36 percent, 35 percent for those having chest tube alone, and none for those undergoing surgery. No death occurred as a direct result of this procedure and all patients could be released from the hospital. Eleven subjects died during the follow-up period; the mean follow-up until death was 37 months (range, 2 to 87 months). Five deaths were due to respiratory causes and six were due to extrapulmonary causes. Tetracycline pleurodesis has been shown to be a good alternative for the prevention of recurrence of SP. Its recurrence rate is lower than that of tube drainage but higher than that of surgical treatment."

There were 58 men and 38 women, aged 18-88 years. There was no significant difference between the three groups in the mean time in hospital or the period for which the drains were retained. The incidence of infection, persistent pneumothorax, and relapse while in hospital was also similar for the three groups. At follow-up in 1987-89 patients could be accounted for, with an average follow-up period of 4.6 years. The incidence of recurrence was 36% in the simple drainage group, 13% in the tetracycline pleurodesis group, and 8% in the talc pleurodesis group. The difference between the talc and simple drainage groups was significant. None of the methods caused severe short or long term side effects or changes in the follow-up chest radiograph. Thoracoscopy, performed on admission in 85 patients, showed normal appearances in 73 patients and small cysts in 12. The thoracoscopic findings were of no value in predicting recurrence. Talc pleurodesis resulted in a significantly lower recurrence rate than simple drainage, tetracycline pleurodesis having intermediate efficacy."

At the same time, to stimulate adhesions, the pleura may be abraded with gauze, chemicals used to cause inflammation or a partial pleurectomy performed. Operation is necessary to decorticate the lung if it has developed a thick peel, in the presence of gross bleeding (hemopneumothorax) or if a large bulla is present. Occasionally, a chronic pneumothorax is due to a persistent leak caused by an adhesion holding open a bulla. The adhesion may be cut at thoracoscopy, using diathermy, and the leak will close. Many chemical agents have been used to encourage adhesions: iodized talcum powder, silver nitrate, 50% glucose and water, Atabrine, nitrogen mustard and tetracycline. In this series, one to three instillations each of 50 ml of autologous blood were used after the lung was fully expanded, usually after the use of an apical chest tube. This procedure was successful in 21 (85%) of 25 patients with difficult, chronic or recurrent pneumothoraces. It is a practical and easy method of causing a chemical pleurodesis, without serious side effects."

In complex cases, in which the risk of repeat thoracotomy is great, other means may be preferable. We report two patients, one with cystic fibrosis and one with extensive radiation fibrosis post-Askin's tumor, in whom the risk of thoracotomy was considered to be prohibitive. Both had a large fistula between the pleural cavity and a segmental bronchus from the right upper lobe. The cystic fibrosis patient had recurrent massive bleeding from the pleural space. A Teflon catheter was passed through a flexible bronchoscope and Super Glue (butyl or methyl methacrylate) was deposited into the fistula. In both cases, the fistula resolved promptly. One patient developed a large, recurrent granuloma at the site of the fistula requiring endoscopic resection. We believe that tissue adhesive may be a reasonable approach to the management of large bronchopleural fistulas when the risk of operative closure is great."

        "abstract": "The standard management of air leaks due to persistent bronchopleural fistula involves chest drainage and occasionally pleurodesis, with intractable cases requiring surgical decortication or surgical repair. However, some of these patients may be at high risk for surgery, particularly if they have already had thoracic surgery or have other medical problems; for this group there is a need for less invasive methods of stopping or reducing air leaks. Emphasys endobronchial valves (EBV) are occlusive devices designed primarily for endoscopic lung volume reduction in emphysema. Because the device is a one-way inspiratory airway blocker, it is possible that it could be used in controlling persistent air leaks while maintaining the drainage of secretions. Two cases are reported of persistent air leaks that were managed by endoscopic occlusion with EBV. In one case complete stoppage of the air leak was achieved with immediate clinical benefits. The second patient died 5 days after treatment from additional complications apparently not related to the procedure. Endobronchial blockage may be a useful salvage procedure for patients with persistent air leak for whom there is no other treatment available."

We report a case of a 61-year-old male with severe bullous emphysema. Following video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and giant bullectomy, he had a persistent air leak. We inserted two endobronchial valves (in the lingular lobe and the anterior segment of the upper lobe) and the air leak ceased immediately. However, over the subsequent 5 months following the insertion of the endobronchial valves, the patient suffered recurrent chest infections and the endobronchial valves were found to have migrated to the orifice of the basal segment of the left lower lobe and the orifice of the basal segments of the right lower lobe."

In a prospective study, the clinical efficacy of intrabronchial valve treatment in patients with a prolonged persistent pulmonary air leak after anatomical surgical resection for cancer was investigated. 10 out of 277 patients with anatomical pulmonary resection for cancer were included, and 90% were scheduled for valve treatment. We demonstrated an air leak cessation at a median of 2 days after valve placement, which resulted in chest tube removal at a median of 4 days after valve placement. Elective removal of the intrabronchial valves could be safely planned 3 weeks after valve implantation. Lung function alteration associated with airway occlusion by valves was limited.

The typically utilized 5-day cut off to define PAL is based on the expected length of stay after lobectomy. Most common causes of PAL include thoracic surgery, chest trauma, secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (related to underlying lung disease), cavitary pulmonary infections (especially tuberculosis), lung biopsies, and as a complication of mechanical ventilation.",

In addition to increased length of hospital stay, other authors have reported increased risk of pulmonary infection and empyema for post-lobectomy patients who develop PAL without an associated increase in mortality (6,12,15). Not surprisingly, these complications also predictably result in increased health care costs associated with PAL (6).",
          "andidates for surgery and they do not address post-surgical air-leaks. Medical pleurodesis may not be ideal or effective for patients who have air-leaks so brisk that visceral and parietal pleural apposition is not achievable. Maintaining an intrapleural catheter with a one-way flutter valve may also allow for outpatient management in some patients, but the risk of pleural space infection is increased and some degree of social support is needed for optimal care of the chest tube (17,18). Conservative management with chest tube placement and observation is often the initial choice and is usually effective (2). When this approach fails management strategies are generally divided into surgical and nonsurgical approaches, including bronchoscopic techniques. Overall goals of treatment are to maintain acceptable oxygenation and ventilation, to decrease or resolve the air leak allowing for full lung expansion if possible, to decrease length of stay, and to prevent recurrence of the air leak and subsequent pneumothorax.",

The investigators randomized 100  patients  undergoing  surgery  for  spontaneous pneumothorax to water seal or continuous suction (-20 cmH 2 O). They found that those patients placed on water seal rather than suction had chest tubes removed earlier, a shorter duration of hospital stay, and a lower rate of prolonged air leak (24).",

In a small series of six patients Wang et al. demonstrated a failure rate of 83% for tetracycline pleurodesis in patients with spontaneous pneumothorax with PAL (37). The largest study to date was published by Light and colleagues in 1990. They randomized 229 patients to receive either intrapleural tetracycline or  usual  care.  Results  showed  that  pleurodesis  with tetracycline did reduce the recurrence rate of spontaneous pneumothorax overall. However, analysis of the subset of 39 patients who had PAL at the time of randomization showed no benefit of tetracycline pleurodesis in those patients with air leak (38). A subsequent study of tetracycline pleurodesis for spontaneous pneumothorax found similarly disappointing results in the subgroup of patients with PAL, with a pleurodesis failure rate of 40% (39). The use of talc for medical chemical pleurodesis in patients with PAL has not been well studied, although it was shown to be more effective than tetracycline for prevention of recurrence of spontaneous pneumothorax without air leak (40). The major adverse effect of pleurodesis with tetracycline or minocycline is severe chest pain (35). Although the pain seen with talc is less severe than that seen with tetracycline, empyema is occasionally seen with talc pleurodesis, as is acute respiratory distress syndrome (Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)) (19). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in talc pleurodesis is thought to be related to extrapleural dissemination of talc when preparations containing smaller size particles are used (41).

The typically utilized 5-day cut off to define PAL is based on the expected length of stay after lobectomy.

Medical pleurodesis may not be ideal or effective for patients who have air-leaks so brisk that visceral and parietal pleural apposition is not achievable. Maintaining an intrapleural catheter with a one-way flutter valve may also allow for outpatient management in some patients, but the risk of pleural space infection is increased and some degree of social support is needed for optimal care of the chest tube (17,18). Conservative management with chest tube placement and observation is often the initial choice and is usually effective (2). When this approach fails management strategies are generally divided into surgical and nonsurgical approaches, including bronchoscopic techniques. Overall goals of treatment are to maintain acceptable oxygenation and ventilation, to decrease or resolve the air leak allowing for full lung expansion if possible, to decrease length of stay, and to prevent recurrence of the air leak and subsequent pneumothorax.",

The investigators randomized 100  patients  undergoing  surgery  for  spontaneous pneumothorax to water seal or continuous suction (-20 cmH 2 O).

In a small series of six patients Wang et al. demonstrated a failure rate of 83% for tetracycline pleurodesis in patients with spontaneous pneumothorax with PAL (37). The largest study to date was published by Light and colleagues in 1990. They randomized 229 patients to receive either intrapleural tetracycline or  usual  care.  Results  showed  that  pleurodesis  with tetracycline did reduce the recurrence rate of spontaneous pneumothorax overall. However, analysis of the subset of 39 patients who had PAL at the time of randomization showed no benefit of tetracycline pleurodesis in those patients with air leak (38). A subsequent study of tetracycline pleurodesis for spontaneous pneumothorax found similarly disappointing results in the subgroup of patients with PAL, with a pleurodesis failure rate of 40% (39). The use of talc for medical chemical pleurodesis in patients with PAL has not been well studied, although it was shown to be more effective than tetracycline for prevention of recurrence of spontaneous pneumothorax without air leak (40). The major adverse effect of pleurodesis with tetracycline or minocycline is severe chest pain (35). Although the pain seen with talc is less severe than that seen with tetracycline, empyema is occasionally seen with talc pleurodesis, as is acute respiratory distress syndrome (Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)) (19). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in talc pleurodesis is thought to be related to extrapleural dissemination of talc when preparations containing smaller size particles are used (41). This risk is much lower if graded talc with only larger size particles is utilized (42).",

          "hat an air leak in the setting of secondary spontaneous pneumothorax should be called persistent after more than 48 hours (7,8). The typically utilized 5-day cut off to define PAL is based on the expected length of stay after lobectomy. Most common causes of PAL include thoracic surgery, chest trauma, secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (related to underlying lung disease), cavitary pulmonary infections (especially tuberculosis), lung biopsies, and as a complication of mechanical ventilation.",

In addition to increased length of hospital stay, other authors have reported increased risk of pulmonary infection and empyema for post-lobectomy patients who develop PAL without an associated increase in mortality (6,12,15). Not surprisingly, these complications also predictably result in increased health care costs associated with PAL (6).",
          "andidates for surgery and they do not address post-surgical air-leaks. Medical pleurodesis may not be ideal or effective for patients who have air-leaks so brisk that visceral and parietal pleural apposition is not achievable. Maintaining an intrapleural catheter with a one-way flutter valve may also allow for outpatient management in some patients, but the risk of pleural space infection is increased and some degree of social support is needed for optimal care of the chest tube (17,18). Conservative management with chest tube placement and observation is often the initial choice and is usually effective (2). When this approach fails management strategies are generally divided into surgical and nonsurgical approaches, including bronchoscopic techniques. Overall goals of treatment are to maintain acceptable oxygenation and ventilation, to decrease or resolve the air leak allowing for full lung expansion if possible, to decrease length of stay, and to prevent recurrence of the air leak and subsequent pneumothorax.",

The investigators randomized 100  patients  undergoing  surgery  for  spontaneous pneumothorax to water seal or continuous suction (-20 cmH 2 O). They found that those patients placed on water seal rather than suction had chest tubes removed earlier, a shorter duration of hospital stay, and a lower rate of prolonged air leak (24).",

In a small series of six patients Wang et al. demonstrated a failure rate of 83% for tetracycline pleurodesis in patients with spontaneous pneumothorax with PAL (37). The largest study to date was published by Light and colleagues in 1990. They randomized 229 patients to receive either intrapleural tetracycline or  usual  care.  Results  showed  that  pleurodesis  with tetracycline did reduce the recurrence rate of spontaneous pneumothorax overall. However, analysis of the subset of 39 patients who had PAL at the time of randomization showed no benefit of tetracycline pleurodesis in those patients with air leak (38). A subsequent study of tetracycline pleurodesis for spontaneous pneumothorax found similarly disappointing results in the subgroup of patients with PAL, with a pleurodesis failure rate of 40% (39). The use of talc for medical chemical pleurodesis in patients with PAL has not been well studied, although it was shown to be more effective than tetracycline for prevention of recurrence of spontaneous pneumothorax without air leak (40). The major adverse effect of pleurodesis with tetracycline or minocycline is severe chest pain (35). Although the pain seen with talc is less severe than that seen with tetracycline, empyema is occasionally seen with talc pleurodesis, as is acute respiratory distress syndrome (Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)) (19). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in talc pleurodesis is thought to be related to extrapleural dissemination of talc when preparations containing smaller size particles are used (41). This risk is much lower if graded talc with only larger size particles is utilized (42).",
          "ully occluded, the chest drain is observed for 2-3 minutes for evidence that the leak is decreasing. If the air leak lessens or stops with occlusion of the first bronchus, the balloon is deflated and then positioned in each more distal segment until the leak is fully localized. It should be the goal of the bronchoscopists to resolve the leak blocking the least amount of bronchial segments. If the leak does not change during the initial occlusion, a  different  lobar  bronchus is  chosen and the process is  repeated  until  the  leak  is  localized.  Of  note,  the air  leak  may  not  change  immediately after occlusion of  the  affected  lobe  because  the  air  remaining  in  the unventilated portion of the lung gradually leaks out with each breath. It is important therefore to keep the balloon inflated long enough to give the leak a chance to decrease before moving on to the next area.",
          "ere initially developed to treat patients with emphysema and hyperinflation, but they have been adopted for use in treatment of PAL as well with significant success (47,48). Two valve systems have been best studied for lung volume reduction and PAL. The Zephyr ® endobronchial valve (EBV, Pulmonx Inc. Neuchatel, Switzerland) has a nitinol framework supporting a silicone 'duck bill'. Several sizes are available for different size airways. The EBV is approved for  use  in  many  countries  outside  the  United States. The intrabronchial valve (IBV, Spiration Inc. Redmond, Washington, USA) consists of a nitinol framework covered with a polymer membrane shaped like an umbrella. It is held in place by 5 anchors to reduce the risk of migration ( Figure 1 ).  The IBV system is approved for use in many countries outside the Unites States and received approval by the Unites States Food and Drug Administration in 2008 under a Humanitarian Device Exemption for treatment of PAL after lung surgery. The current recommendation is that the valves be removed after 6 weeks since the alveolarpleural fistula should have healed by then. The IBV is available in 4 sizes to accommodate bronchial diameters between 5 and 9 mm.",
          "f the valves was attempted had this done successfully. No complications were noted (48). Other subsequent series have confirmed this success. El-Sameed et  al. reported four cases of PAL treated with IBV successfully without complication (72). Cornwell and collaborators reviewed a series of 15 patients with PAL at a large Veterans Affairs hospital, 12 of whom had large leaks and were strictly suction-dependent (patients developed large pneumothorax when placed on water seal). After treatment with a mean of 3.87 IBVs ten patients (67%) had complete resolution of their air leak within 2 days. Of the 12 patients who were suction-dependent prior to IBV placement 11 were able to be placed on water seal immediately after the valve procedure. No major complications were seen, and only two patients had minor complications. In 11 cases subsequent valve removal was attempted, and all IBV removals were completed successfully (73). It is important to emphasize that even in situations where a complete resolution of the leak is not achieved, a partial response that allows to liberate patients from wall suction can be key in reducing length of stay (since patients can then be discharged with a flutter valve, for example). The largest study to date of IBV for air leaks reviewed 75 patients undergoing IBV placement at 8 centers. Off-label indications for valve placement were present in 71% of patients. The mean time from air leak identification to bronchoscopic treatment was 9 days. Complete follow-up data was available for only 59 of the 75 patients who received valves. Of those 59 patients 33 (55%) had complete resolution of the air leak within 1 day of valve implantation. Complications were reported in two patients, and ten patients were eventually discharged home with continued chest drainage (74). IBVs have also been used to treat PAL in patients who are critically ill or being mechanically ventilated with sufficient improvement in the air leak and respiratory status that extubation and eventual ICU discharge were possible (75). No migration or expectoration of IBV has been reported. A randomized trial (NCT02382614) comparing placement of IBV to standard therapy for PAL is ongoing.",

This one should be aligned with the desired location, and then the valve is deployed by pressing the catheter handle gently in a continuous movement over about 2 s timed to coincide with full inspiration. The catheter is then removed from the bronchoscope. The valve is observed for several respiratory cycles to ensure good positioning, and the air leak is monitored as well to determine if the desired decrease has been achieved ( Figure 3 ).  Post procedure chest X-rays are typically obtained to determine if the lung has expanded or remained expanded and to establish the original position of valves ( Figure 4 ).",
