Malignant airway obstruction usually results from direct involvement of bronchogenic carcinoma, or by extension of carcinomas occurring in the esophagus or the thyroid. External compression from lymph nodes or metastatic disease from other organs can also cause central airway obstruction. Most malignant airway lesions are surgically inoperable due to advanced disease stage and require multimodality palliation, including stent placement. As with any other medical device, stents have significantly evolved over the last 50 years and deserve an in-depth understanding of their true capabilities and complications. Not every silicone stent is created equal and the same holds for metallic stents. Herein, we present an overview of the topic as well as some of the more practical and controversial issues surrounding airway stents. We also try to dispel the myths surrounding stent removal and their supposed use only in central airways. At the end, we come to the long-held conclusion that stents should not be used as first line treatment of choice, but after ruling out the possibility of curative surgical resection or repair."

Furthermore, placement of an airway stent can create local inflammation and mucosal injury that may interfere with anastomotic healing following airway resection and reconstruction (2). The most common indications for stenting include minimizing extrinsic compression from tumors or lymphadenopathy, maintaining patency after bronchoscopic tumor removal due to intrinsic obstruction, healing airway fistulas and anastomotic dehiscence post lung transplantation and addressing very selected cases of benign airway disease (3,4). It is important to note that in general, metallic stents are not considered first-line of therapy in patients with benign airway obstruction and should only be used if everything else fails (5)."

When this occurs, it is important to objectively analyze the specific case, the available options for that particular patient and the solid evidence behind the biomaterials and engineering of current airway stents. In other words, be evidence-based and not dogmatic. There are only a few absolute contraindications to stent placement. In general, patients medically able to undergo surgical interventions to cure benign or malignant conditions should not have an artificial airway prosthesis placed (4). Also, very severe impairment in functional capacity and very limited survival expectancy should preclude stenting. However, recent advances in chemotherapy and radiation for lung cancer challenge our prior assumption (6)."

In most cases, careful review of the computed tomography and balloon dilation of the stenosis will reveal if distal airways are patent and thus worthy of reestablishing patency. Relative contraindications include individuals unable to tolerate general anesthesia or moderate sedation (7). In terms of preparation, the clinician should exercise self-restraint and consider if this is the right setting for placement of an airway prosthesis. The most experienced person who can place such a device should be enlisted and a plan should be constructed for contingencies such as airway obstruction during placement, bleeding, or misplacement from the desired location."

However, the ideal stent does not currently exist. At the time of writing of this manuscript, the available airway stent materials include silicone, nitinol, stainless steel and hybrid stents.

The selection should be made based on the specific disease, anatomy and clinical situation. Likewise, the experience of the clinician with a specific stent should not be the key factor deciding which stent to place. A rapid referral to a colleague is better than a lengthy and complicated course. The ease of placement of metallic stents (i.e., without the absolute need for rigid bronchoscopy) has popularized their use in malignant and benign disease (9). However, there has been a significant shift towards the use of silicone stents in benign diseases. In 2005, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning stating that the use of metallic stents should be avoided in benign diseases (5). This warning followed the reports of significant complications in benign airway diseases, when stents were inevitably susceptible based on a relatively longer patient life expectancy and, therefore, longer endobronchial occupancy periods compared to malignant disease indications. It is also important to remember that at the time of that FDA recommendation, the available metallic stents had different biomechanical properties, were mostly uncovered, and, in some cases, repurposed from use in other organs such as the colon, esophagus or biliary tree. Nevertheless, the recommendation stands true today, and should be explicitly considered as follows:"

In addition, they can be easily modified by cutting a portion of the stent, allowing customization to the airway anatomy prior to deployment ( Figure 1 ).

They can be inserted with topical anesthesia and moderate sedation via flexible bronchoscopy, When compared to silicone stents, metallic stents have; a better internal-to-external diameter ratio, resulting in a larger airway lumen; are radio-opaque, making them easy to spot on radiographic films; and have a lower incidence of migration (18,19).

The most important complications are associated with human error in placement, sizing and perhaps overextended placement. The initial stents and tubes (i.e., Montgomery T-tube) required a tracheostomy for placement. Thereafter, the rigid bronchoscope was used, and, in the last two decades, self-expanding metallic stents have been placed with rigid or flexible bronchoscopy. The complications associated with airway stents can derive from the following factors: the material; covering, or lack thereof; continuous movement; infection; mucociliary inhibition; or biomechanical properties of the stent. The original complications associated with metallic stents were the result of repurposing of colon, biliary or vascular stents for airway use. Their high radial force and traumatic borders were responsible for catastrophic complications and clinicians were forced to abandon their use or attempt sizing trickery to minimize migration and other complications. However, complications still occur. Table 3 describes common and uncommon complications of airway stents.",

In the recent years, progress in lung cancer survival and technological improvements in the manufacturing process of airway stents has challenged these assumptions. A growing group of experts are using small metallic stents either in balloon expanding or self-expanding formats with encouraging results (37,38)."

It is imperative to have a pre-procedural agreement with the patient that the stent(s) will only remain in place for 1-2 weeks given the potential complications of airway stents in benign disease. After completing subjective and objective evaluation of its benefit, the stent(s) are removed, where any low-grade granulation or irritation that may have occurred can be expected to resolve within days to weeks.

The removal of silicone stents in general is straightforward. It involves rigid bronchoscopy and the use of rigid forceps to simultaneously twist-and-pull the stent into the barrel of the rigid bronchoscope while maintaining continuous visual contact with the stent. Twisting is thought to prevent tearing of the stent generated from single-plane pulling. In the case of Montgomery T-tubes, the removal just requires gentle yet firm tugging from the horizontal limb; caudally at first, to release the proximal limb, and then cephalad to remove the remaining distal limb."

Every effort should be made to remove the stent in one piece. This minimizes the risk of leaving stent fragments and also decreases the length of the procedure. We described our experience in removing metallic stents by using cryoablation, Jackson dilators or Fogarty balloons and rigid bronchoscopy (42). The removal of metallic stents in the first 2 months is relatively simple. However, after that interval, the degree of difficulty and experience necessary increases."

Laser-cut fully covered stents (i.e., MeritEndotek) will have less tumor ingrowth, but the antimigration fins will likely cause significant mucosal injury and bleeding. After separating them from the wall with Jackson dilators or Fogarty balloon, these stents should be removed by rigid forceps in a twist-and-turn fashion similar to silicone stents. Braided nitinol stents (i.e., Ultraflex) should also be freed from the wall with Jackson or Fogarty balloons first. Thereafter, identify the proximal circumferential suture and pull from that point in order to purse-string the proximal end of the stent and facilitate removal ( Figure 3 ). Failure to do so may result in piecemeal",

These are still prototypes, and their long-term success and complication rates are uncertain. The prospect of minimizing long-term complications from airway stents is inspiring. Given the concern that stents are not always suitable for specific cases and that excessive radial forces exerted by the stent on the airway mucosa may be responsible for excessive granulation tissue, our group and others have explored the possibility of 3-D-printed airway stents (8,45,46). This is a promising field as newer medical-grade materials become available."

        "abstract": "Minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in medicine have been applied for a more selective and tailored approach to reduce patients' morbidity and mortality. The efficacy of interventional pulmonology for palliation of patients with central airways obstruction has been established and its curative potential for intralesional treatment of early cancer has raised great interest in current screening programmes. This is due to the fact that surgical resection and systemic nodal dissection as the gold standard is relatively morbid and risky, especially when dealing with individuals with limited functional reserves due to smoking-related comorbidities, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Furthermore, such comorbidities have been proven to harbour early stage lesions of several millimetres in size without involvement of nodal disease that may be amenable to local bronchoscopic treatment. Therefore, the success of minimally invasive strategies for palliation and treatment with curative intent strongly depends on the diligent identification of the various factors in lung cancer management, including full comprehension of the limits and potential of each particular technique. Maximal preservation of quality of life is a prerequisite in successfully dealing with individuals at risk of harbouring asymptomatic early lung cancer, to prevent aggressive surgical diagnostic and therapeutic strategies since overdiagnosis remains an issue that is heavily debated. In the palliative setting of alleviating central airway obstruction, laser resection, electrocautery, argon plasma coagulation and stenting are techniques that can provide immediate relief, in contrast to cryotherapy, brachytherapy and photodynamic therapy with delayed effects. With curative intent, intraluminal techniques that easily coagulate early stage cancer lesions will increase the implementation of interventional pulmonology for benign and relatively benign diseases, as well as early cancer lesions and its precursors at their earliest stage of disease."

        "abstract": "Recent advances in the three-dimensional (3D) printing industry have enabled clinicians to explore the use of 3D printing in preprocedural planning, biomedical tissue modeling, and direct implantable device manufacturing. Despite the increased adoption of rapid prototyping and additive manufacturing techniques in the health-care field, many physicians lack the technical skill set to use this exciting and useful technology. Additionally, the growth in the 3D printing sector brings an ever-increasing number of 3D printers and printable materials. Therefore, it is important for clinicians to keep abreast of this rapidly developing field in order to benefit. In this Ahead of the Curve, we review the history of 3D printing from its inception to the most recent biomedical applications. Additionally, we will address some of the major barriers to wider adoption of the technology in the medical field. Finally, we will provide an initial guide to 3D modeling and printing by demonstrating how to design a personalized airway prosthesis via 3D Slicer. We hope this information will reduce the barriers to use and increase clinician participation in the 3D printing health-care sector."

        "abstract": "A trachea is a tubular structure composed of smooth muscle that is reinforced with cartilage rings. Some diseases can cause sagging in smooth muscle and cartilaginous tissue. The end result is reduction (narrowing) of the trachea diameter. A solution to this problem is the use of tracheal stents, which are small tubular devices made of silicone. One is inserted into the trachea to prevent or correct its constriction. The purpose of tracheal stent use is to maintain cartilage support that would otherwise be lost in the airway. Current tracheal stent models present limitations in terms of shape and characteristics of the silicone used in their production. One of the most important is the large thickness of the wall, which makes its placement difficult; this mainly applies to pediatric patients. The wall thickness of the stent is closely related to the mechanical properties of the material. This study aims to test the reinforcement of silicone with three kinds of fibers, and then stents that were produced using fiber with the best compressive strength characteristics. Silicone samples were reinforced with polypropylene (PP), polyamide (PA), and carbon fiber (CF) at concentrations of 2% and 4% (vol%), which then underwent tensile strength and Shore A hardness testing. Samples with fiber showed good characteristics; surface analyses were carried out and they were used to produce stents with an internal diameter of 11 or 13mm and a length of 50mm. Stents underwent compression tests for qualitative evaluation. Samples with 2% and 4% CF blends showed the best mechanical performance, and they were used to produce stents. These samples presented similar compressive strengths at low deformation, but stents with a 4% CF blend exhibited improved compressive strength at deformations greater than 30-50% of their diameter (P &#x2264; 0.05). The addition of 2% and 4% CF blends conferred greater mechanical strength and resistance to the silicone matrix. This is particularly true at low deformation, which is the condition where the stent is used when implanted. In the finite element compression strength tests, the stent composite showed greater compression strength with the addition of fiber, and the results were in accordance with mechanical compression tests performed on the stents. In vivo tests showed that, after 30 days of post-implantation in sheep trachea, an inflammatory process occurred in the region of the trachea in contact with the stent composite and with the stent without fiber (WF). This response is a common process during the first few days of implantation."

        "abstract": "Considerable progress has been made since the initial stents were manufactured. Despite the reported side effects, cumulative evidence suggests beneficial effects in properly selected patients. The technology is still in evolution, and design modifications strive to find the perfect stent. The Dumon stent remains the gold standard against which the functions of all other stents are being measured. Unfortunately requirement for the RB for deployment has restricted widespread application at least in the United States. The Wallstent can be inserted using FB and has a great potential among the metal stents. Its biggest drawback is that once inserted it is difficult to remove. Studies with the nitinol Ultraflex and the polyester/silicone Polyflex prototype stent also show promise, although extensive experience and long-term follow-up data are still not available. It is possible that combining the strength of the tube stents with the flexibility of the metal stents may one day help to develop the ideal stent."

        "abstract": "To highlight a potentially fatal complication of broncho-vascular fistula arising from the self expanding metallic stent (SEMS) placement. We retrospectively analyzed five patients with benign and malignant airway diseases, who developed tracheo/broncho-vascular fistulas following SEMS placement in our tertiary care setting. All patients received either Wallstent or Ultraflex(&#xae;) stent (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA) between 1999 and 2007. All patients had received adjunct therapy such as balloon bronchoplasty, laser therapy or electrocautery. Most patients presented with massive hemoptysis. A total of 483 SEMS were placed during this period. SEMS placement can be complicated by Broncho-vascular fistula formation. True incidence and precise time interval between the insertion of stent and onset of this complication is unknown. Additional therapeutic modalities to maintain stent patency may enhance the risk of fistula formation. SEMS should only be used in a select sub-group of patients, after exhaustive evaluation of other treatment options. These cases provide evidence that broncho-vascular fistulas can develop at any time following SEMS placement, suggesting the need for a more cautious approach, especially while using them for a long term management. In benign airway disease, the stent should be removed as soon as healing has taken place."

        "abstract": "Bronchial dehiscence after lung transplantation is difficult to treat and associated with high mortality. We describe our experience using self-expanding metallic stents to treat post-lung transplant bronchial dehiscence. From January 1995 to June 2004, 189 single and 118 double lung transplants were performed in our institution, totaling 425 at-risk bronchial anastomoses. Seven (1.6%) incidents of life-threatening bronchial dehiscence were treated with self-expanding metallic stents. The interval between transplant and diagnosis of dehiscence was 29.1 +/- 18.5 days. All patients presented with respiratory distress, and three required mechanical ventilation. Self-expanding metallic stent placement resulted in complete bronchial healing. All three patients with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation were successfully weaned after stent placement. In two later cases, the stents were electively removed after adequate healing of the dehiscence. Complications included stent migration (one patient) and in-stent stenosis (three patients). Two of these patients required repeat stent insertion after removal, due to bronchomalacia. In patients with life-threatening bronchial dehiscence, self-expanding metallic stents offer prospects for a successful outcome. Self-expanding metallic stents are known to be associated with significant granulation tissue formation, and this property provides a platform for healing of dehiscence and, in time, peribronchial soft tissue grows in to cover the defect, allowing stent removal."

        "abstract": "Overall survival rates of lung transplantation have improved since the first human lung transplantation was performed. A decline in the incidence of airway complications (AC) had been a key feature to achieve the current outcomes. Several proposed risk factors to the development of airway complications have been identified, ranging from the surgical technique to the immunosuppressive regimen. There are essentially six different airway complications post-lung transplantation. The most frequently reported complication is bronchial stenosis. Other complications include bronchial dehiscence, exophytic excessive granulation tissue formation, tracheo-bronchomalacia, bronchial fistulas, and endobronchial infections. The management of post-transplant bronchial complications needs a multispecialty team approach. Prevention of some complications may be possible by early and aggressive medical management as well as by using certain surgical techniques for transplantation. Interventional bronchoscopic procedures, including balloon bronchoplasty, cryotherapy, laser photoresection, electrocautery, high-dose endobronchial brachytherapy, and bronchial stents are among the armamentarium. Also, medical management, like antibiotic prophylaxis and therapy for endobronchial infections, or noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation in case of bronchomalacia, are used to treat an AC. In some cases, different surgical approaches are occasionally required. In this article we review the risk factors, the clinical presentation, the diagnostic methods, as well as the management options of the most common AC after lung transplantation."

The broadening array of bronchoscopic therapies has enhanced treatment options for lung transplant recipients with airway complications.

This study presents the results of the development of a new intraluminal airway stent made from titanium alloy, a metal with \"shape memory effect\". At low temperatures (martensitic state) the titanium alloy stent can be fashioned into a specific shape; then when heated to a higher temperature (austenitic state) the stent alters its shape, only to regain its original shape when recooled to the lower temperature. The stent, connected to a small electric power supply, was introduced into 20 young rabbits with the use of a 2.5 cm rigid bronchoscope. After implantation in the martensitic state the stent was warmed to 40 degrees C, the austenitic state, by an electric current of 1.5 to 3 ampere for 1 to 2 seconds. After a period of 8 to 10 weeks the stent was removed (in its martensitic state) through the same-sized bronchoscope after being cooled with 3 to 4 ml of 80% alcohol solution at 6 degrees C. No signs of airway obstruction developed in any of the animals after implantation or extraction of the stent. The biomechanical properties of the trachea, as shown by strain measurements with the use of incremental forces, showed significant differences between the stented and unstented segments (p &lt; 0.005). The titanium alloy intratracheal stent adequately fulfilled the requirements of a temporary intraluminal airway splint, and because of its unique feature of shape memory effect the stent could be inserted, fixed, and removed easily, even in very small airways."

Metal stents can be placed using a flexible bronchoscope and are less readily removed. Silicone stents require rigid bronchoscopy and general anesthesia for placement but are removable. Both technologies are prone to complications on a long-term basis. A new self-expanding hybrid stent, the AERO stent (Alveolus, Inc., NC, USA), combines the best features of metal and silicone stents with a completely covered nitinol framework. The potential advantages of a self-expanding hybrid stent include placement using flexible bronchoscopy under conscious sedation, easy removability and a potential reduction in common long-term stent implant complications. This article profiles the AERO device and evaluates stent technology in general."

Once an esophagotracheal fistula has developed, the overall condition of the patient declines rapidly. Aspiration pneumonia and severe coughing are common. The introduction of esophageal tubes does not always seal the fistula sufficiently and may compromise the airway causing stridor and dyspnea. In 30 patients (25 male, 5 female; age 23 to 74 years; mean, 56 years) with very large fistulas and airway problems, we inserted an airway stent (Dynamic) (n = 12) or an esophageal tube combined with a Dynamic airway stent (n = 18) with the aim of sealing the fistula and restoring patency of the airway and GI passage. The tracheobronchial Dynamic stent was chosen because its slightly concave, flexible posterior silicone membrane adapts ideally to the convex esophageal tube. The stents were well tolerated and significantly improved the quality of life. Of 30 patients, 16 could breathe and swallow unimpaired until shortly before their death. Moderate complaints persisted in five patients, dysphagia in eight patients, and dyspnea in one patient. Mean survival time in the double stent group was significantly greater (110 days) than in the airway stent-only group (24 days) or comparable groups in the literature treated with esophageal tubes only. We conclude that carefully selected patients can benefit from double stenting of esophagus and airways."

Current techniques for SEMAS removal also involve serious complications. We are reporting a novel two-staged endoscopic approach using cryotechnology for removal of SEMAS obstructed by exuberant granulation tissue in two patients. During the first stage, the obstructing intraluminal granulation tissue was removed with cryodebridement and residual extraluminal deposits were lysed with cryotherapy. During the second stage, performed two days later, the SEMAS was liberated by mechanical means and removed in one piece. The staged approach with cryotechnology was successful and without complications."

        "abstract": "Airway stents are indicated to treat symptomatic narrowing or to close fistulas of the central airways. They are generally divided into two types: the silicone stents and the metallic stents. Unlike in malignancies, removability is a major objective of temporary stenting in benign conditions, which poses the challenge of a new rigid bronchoscopic procedure under general anesthesia and stent removal with all its attendant risks and costs. The concept of a biodegradable (BD) stent that could maintain the patency of an airway for a predetermined duration of time is very appealing. These BD stents would gradually degrade and eventually vanish from the airway once they are no longer needed. Such stents are currently an area of intense research. Another very promising concept of drug delivery with such stents is also a very exciting area of current research. The aim of this comprehensive review is to discuss all pertinent available literature on the use of BD materials in various clinical applications and to extensively review all animal and humans trials involving BD airway stents."

        "abstract": "Stent placement has been established as a standard procedure for treating airway obstructions. Other indications are localized malacias and fistulas. Though many different stents with various diameters and lengths are available, the shapes are hardly ever ideal because of the distorted anatomy in patients with diseased airways. There are technical and legal limitations for customizing purchased airway stents. Individually tailored stents would be preferable. New techniques of additive manufacturing such as 3D printing make it possible to produce optimized stents for a particular patient. Using CT data and bronchoscopic images, stents can be constructed that match a particular anatomical situation and apply the optimized expansion force. We give an overview of the currently available manufacturing techniques for polymeric stents and report about our own experience. Direct on-site printing of polyurethane stents in a hospital and printing individual extrusion molds for silicone stents in a certified cleanroom are both feasible. Furthermore, there are promising attempts of combining mechanically customized stents with surface modifications, drug-eluting features, biodegradability, and time-dependent adaptation (4D printing). Truly optimized airway stents with the potential of solving the well-known stent problems such as granulation tissue formation, remodeling, mucostasis, and infections are in reach. The technical hurdles are probably easier to overcome than the legal constraints. The legal situations are discussed from a physician's and a manufacturer's perspective."
