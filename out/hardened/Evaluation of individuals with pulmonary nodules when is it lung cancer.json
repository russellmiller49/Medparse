The recommendations stress the value of assessing the probability of malignancy, the utility of imaging tests, the need to weigh the beneﬁts and harms of different management strategies (nonsurgical biopsy, surgical resection, and surveillance with chest CT imaging), and the importance of eliciting patient preferences.\nConclusions: Individuals with pulmonary nodules should be evaluated and managed by estimating the probability of malignancy, performing imaging tests to better characterize the lesions, evaluating the risks associated with various management alternatives, and eliciting their preferences for management.

All searches  were  performed  in  October  2011  and  subsequently updated through May 2012. We identifi  ed additional articles by searching our own personal fi  les and by reviewing reference lists of included studies. We included all randomized controlled trials, controlled observational studies, uncontrolled studies of diagnostic  accuracy,  and  cross-sectional  studies  that  examined relationships between nodule morphology and outcomes. A multidisciplinary writing committee comprising four pulmonologists, two thoracic surgeons, and one radiologist formulated questions (  Table S1  ), synthesized and reviewed available evidence, developed or revised recommendations, rated the quality of evidence, and graded the strength of the recommendations by using a standardized approach, as described by Lewis et al 1  in 'Methodology for Development of Guidelines for Lung Cancer' in the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) Lung Cancer Guidelines. The writing committee reviewed all recommendations and reached consensus by iterative discussion and debate. The manuscript was extensively revised, although some sections of text (including much of the section on solid nodules measuring ≤ 8 mm in diameter) were considered to be current and, therefore, retained from the previous version. The resulting guideline supersedes the previous version. The guideline was reviewed by all members of the ACCP Lung Cancer Guidelines Panel prior to approval by the Thoracic"

In an uncontrolled study of CT scan screening in New York, 30% of the participants with cancer identifi  ed during baseline (prevalence) screening had one or more additional nodules at the time of detection. 180  None of these were reported to be malignant after follow-up. 181  In the Mayo Clinic screening study, . 50% of the 31 participants with cancer had other nodules detected, and all but one (a  carcinoid tumor) were proven to be benign by absence of growth during follow-up. 182  In these studies, the majority of secondary nodules measured , 4 mm, which implies a very low risk of malignancy. Therefore, although the likelihood of fi  nding one or more additional nodules increases with the use of smaller slice thickness on CT scan, the majority of additional nodules will be benign."

Preoperative PET scanning may help in the decision of whether more than one nodule is likely malignant and guide further evaluation, although many of these nodules will be too small to be reliably characterized by PET scan. Above all, candidates for curative treatment with known or suspected malignant nodules who have one or more additional nodules present should not be denied curative therapy unless metastasis is confi  rmed by histopathology. A moredetailed discussion is provided by Kozower et al 183 in the in 'Special Treatment Issues in Non-small Cell Lung Cancer' article of the ACCP Lung Cancer Guidelines."

            "text": "The pulmonary nodule is increasingly common and remains a vexing problem. Individuals with solid nodules measuring . 8 mm should be managed by reviewing old imaging studies; estimating the probability of malignancy; performing imaging tests to better characterize the nodule; evaluating the risks associated with various management alternatives; and eliciting patient preferences for CT scan surveillance, nonsurgical biopsy, or surgical diagnosis. Solid nodules measuring ≤ 8 mm are infrequently malignant, diffi  cult to biopsy, risky to resect, and not reliably characterized by PET scan or other functional imaging tests, leaving CT scan surveillance as the most appropriate option. At this time, the frequency and duration of surveillance are guided by expert consensus-based recommendations from the Fleischner Society. Subsolid nodules often are premalignant or malignant and may require extended-duration surveillance for growth or development of a solid component. Further research is needed to weigh the benefi  ts and harms of alternative methods for evaluating both solid and subsolid nodules. Research priorities include developing and validating risk assessment models to estimate the probability of cancer among individuals with small nodules or subsolid nodules, performing studies that compare the benefi  ts and harms of alternative management strategies  among  individuals  stratifi  ed by cancer risk, determining the safety of CT scan surveillance by examining outcomes among individuals who choose this strategy, and developing and validating novel noninvasive biomarkers to facilitate diagnosis and determine prognosis."

The recommendations stress the value of assessing the probability of malignancy, the utility of imaging tests, the need to weigh the beneﬁts and harms of different management strategies (nonsurgical biopsy, surgical resection, and surveillance with chest CT imaging), and the importance of eliciting patient preferences.\nConclusions: Individuals with pulmonary nodules should be evaluated and managed by estimating the probability of malignancy, performing imaging tests to better characterize the lesions, evaluating the risks associated with various management alternatives, and eliciting their preferences for management.

This method may improve the accuracy of estimating the likelihood of malignancy for individual patients with solitary pulmonary nodules."

Two other radiologists evaluated the same nodules according to various radiographic and clinical findings. These findings were then used to estimate the probability of malignancy by using previously derived likelihood ratios and the Bayes theorem. The readers using Bayesian analysis performed significantly better than the expert readers (P &lt; .05) when individual radiographs were considered and when all radiologic studies were combined. In addition, the readers using Bayesian analysis misclassified fewer malignant nodules as benign (mean, 6.5) than did the expert readers (mean, 6.5) than did the expert readers (mean, 16.5). The authors conclude that Bayesian analysis may be a useful aid in the evaluation of solitary pulmonary nodules."

Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the relationship of clinical and radiographic variables to the etiology of PN in a retrospectively identified cohort of SOT recipients at a single transplant center. PNs in 55 SOT recipients (lung 15%, heart 22%, liver 42%, kidney 18% or kidney/pancreas 5%) were diagnosed at a mean of 1061 days post-transplant and were infectious in 31 of 55 (56%) (bacterial 22%, fungal 33%, viral 2%) and noninfectious in 24 of 55 (44%) [post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) 25%, carcinoma 18%]. Radiographic 'consolidation' was independently associated with an infectious etiology (OR, 20.2, p &lt; 0.01). Epstein-Barr virus seronegativity and lung transplant were each associated with PTLD (OR, 21.7, p &lt; 0.01) and (OR, 36.6, p &lt; 0.001), respectively. Diagnosis less than 90 days post-transplant was associated with Aspergillus infection (OR, 12.9, p = 0.007). Specific clinical and radiographic features are associated with specific etiologies of PNs in SOT recipients and might be useful for guiding empiric therapy while awaiting results of definitive diagnostic studies."

Benign nodules made up 44% of all SPNs and 58% of the 431 that were 2 cm or less in diameter. All malignant SPNs were assessed as indeterminate, and adenocarcinoma (42%) was the most common primary malignancy. A total of 176 (63% of benign SPNs) were correctly assessed as benign by CT. Ninety SPNs assessed as diffusely calcified were not so identified by conventional tomography at outside institutions. An SPN can be reliably assessed by CT as benign if it exhibits high attenuation values, exceeding a critical level and distributed diffusely throughout a CT section through the center of the lesion and a well-defined edge. Although 38 of 283 (13.4%) primary lung cancers contained localized calcification, there was no significant overlap with the diffuse calcification of benign lesions. Central carcinoid tumors may contain focal ossification, but such lesions may be recognized by noting the proximity of larger bronchi. Assessment of SPNs by CT is most effective for lesions 2.0 cm or less in diameter. For larger lesions, the frequency of benign disease was decreased (14.3% of 203), as was the percentage of benign SPNs correctly assessed as benign by CT (37.9%)."

A total of 384 nodules not considered calcified by conventional methods were examined; 118 (31%) proved to be benign, and in 65 of these (55%), unsuspected calcification was demonstrated. In 28 of the 65, definite calcification could be identified on thin-section CT scans by simple inspection of the scans at narrow windows. In the remaining 37, presence of calcification could not be clearly established without comparison with the reference CT number from the calibration phantom. CT was most effective in establishing the benignancy of nodules 3 cm or less in diameter and those with discrete or smooth margins. CT rarely yields a confident diagnosis of benign disease in larger nodules and in those with irregular or spiculated borders. After review of prior spot radiographs, low kilovolt peak spot radiographs, and conventional tomograms, the authors conclude that thin-section CT aided by a reference phantom in equivocal cases should be an integral part of the diagnostic approach to the pulmonary nodule."

Pleural tags were observed in three benign nodules (27%) and 49 malignant lesions (58%); pathologically, these represented fibrotic bands usually associated with juxta-cicatricial pleural retraction. Bubblelike areas of low attenuation within the nodule were observed in 21 malignant lesions (25%) and only one benign nodule (9%). They were observed most commonly in bronchioloalveolar carcinomas (seven of 14) and were due either to patent small bronchi or small, cystic spaces within neoplastic glands. Malignant nodules as a group were larger than benign lesions (P = .02) and more commonly demonstrated a spiculated contour (P less than .05), lobulation (P less than .001), and inhomogeneous attenuation (P less than .05)."

The imaging characteristics of 133 consecutive resolving pulmonary nodules detected in 56 subjects in a screening trial for early lung cancer with low-dose CT were retrospectively reviewed by two readers in consensus. Nodule size ranged from 2 to 28 mm, with a mean diameter of 5.9 mm. The maximum diameter of resolving nodules was &lt; or =5 mm in 71/133 (53%), 6-10 mm in 52/133 (39%), and &gt;10 mm in 10/133 (8%). Their location was mainly peripheral, with a mean distance to the costal pleura of 10 mm. There was no lobe predominance of nodules. In 85% (113/133) of cases the nodules were solid, 77% (103/133) were well-defined, and 73% (97/133) were non-lobulated. Eighty percent (107/133) resolved completely within 14-1,671 (mean 492) days, 20% (26/133) resolved incompletely with residual abnormalities within 51-1,777 (mean 613) days. Resolving pulmonary nodules were mostly &lt; or =10 mm, peripherally located, solid, well-defined, and non-lobulated. Most resolve completely within a variable interval ranging from several days to years."

Measurement of maximum nodule perimeter difference to the approximate oval was performed using volume-rendering images of three directions of each pulmonary nodule. The margin was then traced manually and our custom software delineated the approximate oval automatically. The maximum nodule perimeter difference was 26.5&#xb1;23.3 mm for malignant and 16.6&#xb1;16.9 mm for benign nodules, showing an almost statistically significant difference (P=.07). This study suggests that the maximum nodule perimeter difference to the approximate oval of the malignant nodules has a tendency to be longer than benign nodules."

Our institutional review board approved this retrospective study with a waiver of informed consent. We selected 100 patients (M:F=56:44, mean age; 58 years) with a pathologically proven solid or partly solid SPN. Three chest radiologists assessed the nodule characteristics independently and retrospectively. Diagnostic efficacies were compared for three different approaches: consideration of CT findings only, PET findings only, and both PET and CT findings. The McNemar test, kappa statistics, and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis were performed. Sixty patients had benign and 40 had malignant nodules. Overall sensitivity values for malignant SPNs for CT, PET and PET/CT were 82%, 88%, and 88%, respectively, whereas the specificity values were 66%, 71%, and 77%, respectively. PET/CT was significantly better in terms of specificity than the use of PET alone or CT alone (P&lt;.05). The areas under curve (Az) values for the ROC analyses of PET/CT and PET alone, respectively, were larger than that of CT alone (P&lt;.05). Interobserver agreement was moderate (kappa=0.46-0.56) for CT, good to excellent (kappa=0.78-0.90) for PET, and good for PET/CT (kappa=0.64-0.78). For the characterization of SPNs, integrated PET/CT provides significantly better specificity than CT alone or PET alone and both integrated PET/CT and PET alone allow more confidence than CT alone."

Using decision analysis, we compared the average life expectancy produced by alternative strategies for managing the patient with a solitary pulmonary nodule: thoracotomy for diagnosis and potential resection (IMMEDIATE SURGERY); needle aspiration biopsy or bronchoscopy (BIOPSY) followed by either thoracotomy or extended observation, depending on the results of the biopsy; and serial chest films with thoracotomy if the nodule grows at a potentially malignant rate (OBSERVATION). IMMEDIATE SURGERY produced a slightly longer average life expectancy when the probability of cancer was very high; BIOPSY had a narrow advantage when the probability of cancer was intermediate; and OBSERVATION produced slightly longer average life-expectancy when the probability of malignancy was very low. But the differences between strategies were so small that, in most circumstances, the decision was a \"close call.\" Therefore, when choosing between these management strategies, physicians should give greater weight to considerations besides life expectancy, and should encourage patients to actively participate in the decisions about how to manage their solitary pulmonary nodules."

        "abstract": "This article identifies the characteristics of patients and office visits associated with decreased mutual decision-making between physicians and patients. In the baseline cross-sectional survey of the Medical Outcomes Study we measured specific patient characteristics hypothesized to influence participatory decision-making (PDM) styles of physicians. We related these characteristics to the PDM style scores for their physicians. The study was conducted in solo practices, multi-specialty groups, and health maintenance organizations in Boston, Chicago, and Los Angeles. Over a 9-day period in 1986, 8,316 patients were sampled from the practices of 344 participating Medical Outcome Study physicians, representing general internal medicine, family practice, cardiology and endocrinology. Physicians' PDM style was measured using a 3-item scale included on the baseline questionnaire completed by patients after office visits to their Medical Outcome Study physicians. We found that the elderly (age 75 and older) and young adult (younger than age 30) patients, patients with high school education or less, minority patients, and male patients had the least participatory visits with their physicians. We also found that male patients seeing male physicians had the least participatory visits compared with male patients seeing female physicians, and compared with female patients seeing physicians of either gender. Our data indicated that PDM style increased as duration or tenure of the physician-patient relationship increased. Participatory decision-making style also increased with increasing length of office visits. The role of effective interpersonal care in optimizing patients' health outcomes may be underappreciated. We have identified seven patient and visit characteristics that maximize or compromise the effectiveness of interpersonal care. Recognizing those at risk for suboptimal interpersonal care may be a first step in improving the management of chronic disease. Key words: participatory decision-making style; interpersonal care; doctor-patient communication."

Thirty-seven pathologically proven lung cancers (range, 8-57 mm in diameter) were evaluated using incremental dynamic CT. Scans were obtained before and 30 seconds, 2 minutes, and 5 minutes after the onset of contrast material injection. Computed tomography numbers in circular regions of interest (60% of tumor diameter) were calculated, and the difference in CT number between nonenhanced and the scan showing maximum attenuation was determined. In cavitary necrotic carcinomas, regions of interest were established excluding areas of cavitation. Nine (24%) of 37 lung carcinomas had intratumoral necrosis; four (11%) had noncavitary necrosis, and five (14%) had cavitary necrosis. Maximum attenuation of four noncavitary necrotic carcinomas (mean 31 +/- standard deviation 25 HU; range, -3-56 HU) was lower than cavitary necrotic carcinomas (42 +/- 8 HU; range, 35-51 HU; p = 0.36) and non-necrotic carcinomas (48 +/- 17 HU; range, 25-91 HU; p = 0.07). All carcinomas showed maximum attenuation &gt; or = 25 HU except for one noncavitary necrotic carcinoma (maximum attenuation = -3 HU; 36 mm in diameter). Noncavitary necrosis was recognized as low attenuation on noncontrast scan in two of four cases and as an unenhanced area on enhanced scan in four of four cases. Although noncavitary necrotic lung carcinoma may rarely show maximum attenuation &lt; or = 15 HU, necrotic material is recognized as unenhanced area on enhanced scan."

Perfusion, peak enhancement intensity (PEI), time to peak (TTP) and blood volume (BV) were measured and statistically compared among different groups. Mean perfusion, PEI and BV for benign SPNs were significantly lower than those for malignant nodules (p&lt;0.05) and active infections (p&lt;0.05), but the differences were not statistically significant between malignant tumours and active infections (p&gt;0.05). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that SPNs with perfusion greater than 30.6 ml min(-1) ml(-1), PEI higher than 23.3 HU or BV larger than 12.2 ml per 100 g were more likely to be malignant. In conclusion, first-pass perfusion imaging with 64-detector row CT is a feasible way of assessing whole nodule perfusion and helpful in differentiating benign from malignant SPNs."

A total of 74 PPLs (69.2%) were diagnosed by TBB using EBUS-GS with X-ray fluoroscopy. Diagnostic yield by FDG-PET was 78.5% for the 107 PPLs examined. Diagnostic yield with the combination of TBB using EBUS-GS and FDG-PET (90.7%) was significantly higher compared with that for each procedure alone. A significant increment in diagnostic yield with this combination was seen for PPLs &gt;20mm and &lt; or = 30 mm and for malignant lesions. Combination of TBB using EBUS-GS and FDG-PET is useful for the diagnosis of small PPLs."

The sensitivities and specificities of these techniques for discriminating benign and malignant nodules were compared. The apparent diffusion coefficients of the pulmonary nodules on 1.5-T and 3-T imaging correlated significantly. The sensitivities and specificities for discriminating benign and malignant lesions were similar among the 3 imaging techniques: 1.5-T imaging, 0.91 and 0.90; 3-T imaging, 0.88 and 0.94; positron-emission tomography, 0.94 and 0.94. The apparent diffusion coefficient on 1.5-T imaging showed a significant reverse correlation with positron-emission tomography, and the correlation between 3-T imaging and positron-emission tomography was marginally significant. Both 1.5-T and 3-T diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging modalities are equally useful for assessing malignant pulmonary nodules."

This was the total number assessed as suitable for radical treatment by one consultant during 1999. At the time of assessment they had been newly diagnosed and staged with a computed tomographic (CT) scan of chest. They had a subsequent CT scan prior to starting treatment for the purpose of planning the radiation fields. We have now measured tumour size on the diagnostic scans and compared this with the size on the planning scans. We have documented the delay between diagnostic and planning CT scanning and the total time between first hospital visit and starting treatment. Two patients had progression of symptoms while on the waiting list, making them unfit for radical treatment, and another four had tumour progression on planning CT such that the tumour volume was too large for radical treatment. Therefore, 21% of potentially curable patients became incurable on the waiting list. The delay between diagnostic and planning CT scans ranged from 18 to 131 days (median 54), with increases in the cross-sectional tumour size over that period ranging zero to 373%. The delay between the first hospital visit and starting treatment was 35-187 days (median 94); between the date of the radiotherapy request and the starting date for treatment it was 23-61 days (median 44). Limited access to specialists is the reason most often advanced for the poor performance of the UK in treating lung cancer. This study demonstrates that, even for the select minority of patients who have specialist referral and are deemed suitable for potentially curative treatment, the outcome is prejudiced by waiting times that allow tumour progression."

Although there currently exists software for CT scan machines that automate nodule volume estimation, the imprecision associated with volume estimates is particularly poor for nodules &lt; or = 6 mm in diameter, with greater imprecision associated with increasing CT scan slice thickness. This study examined the effects of the volume estimation error associated with four CT scan slice thicknesses (0.625, 1.25, 2.50, and 5.00 mm) on estimates of volume doubling time (VDT) for solid nodules of various sizes."

Nodules were evaluated by size, location, surface contour, and the presence in cross-section of a bronchus leading to or contained within the nodule or mass, a \"positive bronchus sign.\" Thirty-five lesions were associated with a positive bronchus sign; 21 of 35 (60 percent) were diagnosed endoscopically, (p = .027); of 30 cases with a negative bronchus sign, only ten (30 percent) had a diagnosis made by FOB (p = .034). It is concluded that CT may be of use in the routine evaluation of pulmonary nodules, prior to bronchoscopy, especially in cases for which histologic evaluation is essential, especially to determine the presence or absence of a CT bronchus sign."

        "abstract": "Improved diagnostic sensitivity of bronchsocopy for the investigation of peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs) with the use of radial probe endobroncial ultrasound (EBUS) has been reported, although diagnostic performance varies considerably. A systematic review of published literature evaluating radial probe EBUS accuracy was performed to determine point sensitivity and specificity, and to construct a summary receiver-operating characteristic curve. Sub-group analysis and linear regression was used to identify possible sources of study heterogeneity. 16 studies with 1,420 patients fulfilled inclusion criteria. Significant inter-study variation in EBUS method was noted. EBUS had point specificity of 1.00 (95% CI 0.99-1.00) and point sensitivity of 0.73 (95% CI 0.70-0.76) for the detection of lung cancer, with a positive likelihood ratio of 26.84 (12.60-57.20) and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.28 (0.23-0.36). Significant inter-study heterogeneity for sensitivity was observed, with prevalence of malignancy, lesion size and reference standard used being possible sources. EBUS is a safe and relatively accurate tool in the investigation of PPLs. Diagnostic sensitivity of EBUS may be influenced by the prevalence of malignancy in the patient cohort being examined and lesion size. Further methodologically rigorous studies on well-defined patient populations are required to evaluate the generalisability of our results."

This has to be balanced against the potential benefits of detection of a malignant tumor with radiologic examinations. For comparison of radiation exposure levels from different sources, the concept of effective dose equivalent was developed, which is used to assess an individual's risk of developing malignancy. Effective dose equivalent ranges from 0.06 to 0.25 millisieverts (mSv) with chest radiography in 2 views, 3-27 mSv with computed tomography (CT) using conventional examination parameters, and 0.3-0.55 mSv using low dose CT settings. These values can be compared with radiation exposure levels from natural sources (on average 2.4 mSv per year in Germany). Based on considerations by the International Commission on Radiological Protection, it can be expected that radiation exposure with an effective dose equivalent of 1 mSv would lead to 5 additional malignancies in 100,000 individuals exposed."

        "abstract": "Between June 1991 and July 1992, 118 patients (57 men and 61 women) underwent video-assisted thoracoscopy for indeterminate pulmonary nodules. Median age was 64 years (range 30 to 85 years). Thoracotomy was performed in 33 patients (28.0%) after thoracoscopy only because the nodule could not be located in 17 patients, was too large to safely resect in 5, appeared malignant in 4, and for technical reasons in 7. Eighty-five patients underwent thoracoscopic wedge excision. Twenty-one (24.7%) of these 85 patients also had thoracotomy--15 to perform formal lung resection for bronchogenic carcinoma, 3 for nondiagnostic abnormalities, 2 to locate a second nodule, and 1 for stapler malfunction. The remaining 64 patients (54.2%) had only video-assisted thoracoscopic wedge excision. A single wedge excision was performed in 56 patients, two in 6, and three in 2. Pathologic examination of these 74 nodules revealed a granuloma in 30, metastatic cancer in 25, hamartoma in 7, lymphoma in 1, and other benign lesions in 11. There were no deaths and only 4 (6.3%) complications in these 64 patients. The 64 patients treated by thoracoscopy only were compared with a similar group of 64 patients who had wedge excision via thoracotomy without prior thoracoscopy. Postoperative analgesic requirements were less in the patients treated by thoracoscopy. Median hospitalization in the thoracoscopy group was 3 days compared with 6 days in the thoracotomy group (p &lt; 0.05). Median total charge for the thoracoscopy-only group was $12,898 as compared with $12,502 for patients undergoing wedge excision via thoracotomy. We conclude that thoracoscopic wedge excision is a safe and effective procedure in selected patients with an indeterminate pulmonary nodule. A significant number of patients (45.8%), however, required a thoracotomy to accomplish a safe operation or to ensure adequate staging and resection for malignancy. Although thoracoscopy reduces postoperative analgesia requirements and shortens hospital stay, total hospital charges were similar to charges for a wedge excision via thoracotomy."

        "abstract": "Traditional nonoperative diagnostic approaches to the indeterminate solitary pulmonary nodule include bronchoscopy and percutaneous needle biopsy. Although both methods are minimally invasive, the diagnosis of the small, peripheral nodule may remain elusive. Open thoracotomy is often required when these methods fail to obtain a diagnosis. Between January 1991 and June 1992, 242 patients with indeterminate solitary lung nodules underwent thoracoscopic excisional biopsy as the primary diagnostic method. Wedge excisions of the nodules were all performed by thoracoscopic techniques using an endoscopic stapler alone (72%), neodymium:yttrium-aluminum garnet laser (18%), or both (10%). A definite diagnosis was obtained in all patients. Two patients required conversion to thoracotomy to locate the nodule (both malignant). A benign diagnosis was obtained in 127 patients (52%) and a malignant diagnosis in 115 (48%). Of the malignant nodules, 51 (44%) were primary lung cancer and 64 (56%) were metastases. All patients diagnosed with primary lung cancer having adequate pulmonary reserve (n = 29) underwent formal open lung resection during the same procedure. There was no mortality, and significant morbidity was limited to atelectasis in 3 patients (1.2%), pneumonia in 2 patients (0.8%), and prolonged air leak more than 7 days in 4 patients (1.6%). Average hospital stay for patients having thoracoscopy only (n = 213) was 2.4 days (range, 1 to 12 days). Thoracoscopy offers a minimally invasive approach for the diagnosis of the indeterminate solitary nodule. It has advantages over traditional diagnostic methods of being virtually 100% sensitive and 100% specific with no mortality and minimal morbidity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

To evaluate low-radiation-dose spiral computed tomography and sputum cytology in screening for lung cancer, we enrolled 1,520 individuals aged 50 yr or older who had smoked 20 pack-years or more in a prospective cohort study. One year after baseline scanning, 2,244 uncalcified lung nodules were identified in 1,000 participants (66%). Twenty-five cases of lung cancer were diagnosed (22 prevalence, 3 incidence). Computed tomography alone detected 23 cases; sputum cytology alone detected 2 cases. Cell types were: squamous cell, 6; adenocarcinoma or bronchioalveolar, 15; large cell, 1; small cell, 3. Twenty-two patients underwent curative surgical resection. Seven benign nodules were resected. The mean size of the non-small cell cancers detected by computed tomography was 17 mm (median, 13 mm). The postsurgical stage was IA, 13; IB, 1; IIA, 5; IIB, 1; IIIA, 2; limited, 3. Twelve (57%) of the 21 non-small cell cancers detected by computed tomography were stage IA at diagnosis. Computed tomography can detect early-stage lung cancers. The rate of benign nodule detection is high."

The present retrospective study aimed to test the validity of a multistep approach to discriminate malignant from benign localised (focal) GGOs, identifies useful diagnostic features on computed tomography (CT), and suggests appropriate management guidelines. A stepwise approach, including oral antibiotics, follow-up high-resolution CT (HRCT) 40-60 days later and CT-guided core biopsy, was used. All cases with localised GGOs detected since 2001 were reviewed. CT features were described according to a structured scheme. In total, 40 patients were evaluated. Of these, 11 patients were diagnosed with benign GGOs, 19 patients had lung cancer and 10 were undetermined. Nonpolygonal shape, apparent radial growth and clear-cut margins were associated with a malignant histology. The specificity of CT findings was low. Diagnostic accuracy increased after oral antibiotics, follow-up HRCT and percutaneous core biopsy. Overall, 18 patients underwent surgery for lung cancer. In conclusion, malignant ground-glass opacities have a fairly typical appearance, but some benign lesions closely mimic their malignant counterparts. The stepwise approach adopted in the present study increased the diagnostic specificity and reduced time to definitive diagnosis. Segmentectomy might be the ideal resection volume for such tumours."

        "abstract": "CT has recently been used in mass screening for lung cancer. Small cancers have been identified but the growth characteristics of these lesions are not fully understood. We identified 82 primary cancers in our 3-year mass CT screening programme, of which 61 were examined in the present study. The volume doubling time (VDT) was calculated based on the exponential model using successive annual CT images or follow-up CT images. All cases were also examined in the hospital by high resolution CT (HRCT). Lesions were divided into three types based on HRCT characteristics: type G (n = 19), ground glass opacity (GGO); type GS (n = 19), focal GGO with a solid central component; and type S (n = 23), solid nodule. 18 (95%) lesions of type G, 18 (95%) of type GS and 7 (30%) of type S were invisible on conventional chest radiographs. The mean size of the tumour was 10 mm, 11 mm and 16 mm for type G, type GS and type S, respectively. Most tumours (80%) were adenocarcinomas; 78% of these were GGO (type G and GS). Mean VDT values were 813 days, 457 days and 149 days for type G, type GS and type S, respectively; these are significantly different from each other (p &lt; 0.05). Our results show that annual mass screening CT for 3 successive years resulted in the identification of a large number of slowly growing adenocarcinomas that were not visible on chest radiographs."

        "abstract": "Small lung cancers frequently have been detected in mass screening by computed tomography (CT) in recent years. Suitability of limited resection for these small lung cancers remains controversial. One hundred patients who underwent sublobular limited resection (wedge resection or segmentectomy) for lung cancer in our hospital from 1981 to 2002 were analyzed retrospectively. From CT findings, tumors were classified into two groups; pure ground-glass opacity (PGGO) and non-PGGO. Patients included 44 women and 56 men, and ages ranged from 40 to 92 years (mean, 71.0). Histologic types included 76 adenocarcinomas, 21 squamous cell carcinomas, and 3 large cell carcinomas. Clinical stages included 83 stage IA and 17 stage IB. By high-resolution CT, 27 tumors (27%) showed PGGO; at postoperative histopathologic examination, all of these were localized bronchioloalveolar carcinomas. Diameter of tumors showing PGGO was 9.3+/-mm (mean +/- S.D.); that of non-PGGO tumors was 21.2+/-13.7 mm. Overall and lung cancer-specific 5-year survival rates in all patients were 58.0 and 64.8%, respectively. Overall 5-year survival rate with small adenocarcinomas (&lt;or=20mm) was 93.7%, significantly better than 24.8% with larger adenocarcinomas ( P&lt;0.0001 ). No intrathoracic recurrence or distant metastasis has been observed in PGGO tumors. For peripheral localized bronchioloalveolar carcinoma showing PGGO, wedge resection appears to be the best operation. Definitive study of more patients with longer follow-up is needed."

        "abstract": "Pulmonary nodule characterization is currently being redefined as new clinical, radiologic, and pathologic data are reported, necessitating a reevaluation of the clinical management, especially of subsolid nodules. These are now known to frequently, although not invariably, fall into the spectrum of peripheral adenocarcinomas of the lung. Strong correlation between the Noguchi histologic classification and computed tomographic (CT) appearances of these lesions, in particular, has been reported. Serial CT findings have further documented that stepwise progression of lesions with ground-glass opacity, manifested as an increase in size or the appearance and/or subsequent increase of solid components, does occur in a select subset of patients. As a consequence, recognition of the potential association between subsolid nodules and peripheral adenocarcinomas requires a review of current guidelines for the management of these lesions, further necessitated by a differential diagnosis that includes benign lesions such as focal inflammation, focal fibrosis, and organizing pneumonia. Specific issues that need to be addressed are the need for consensus regarding an appropriate CT classification, methods for precise measurement of subsolid nodules, including the extent of both ground-glass and solid components, as well as accurate assessment of the growth rates as means for predicting malignancy and prognosis. It is anticipated that interim guidelines may serve to standardize our current management of these lesions, pending further clarification of their natural history."

Therefore, the accuracy of PET for diagnosing and staging of BAC was investigated. We studied 41 patients eventually found to have adenocarcinoma with a bronchioloalveolar growth pattern who were referred for characterization or staging of lung lesions with whole-body FDG-PET between January 1998 and March 2001: there were 11 males (27%) and 30 females (73%), with a mean age of 66.0+/-10.9 (range =44-84 years). Patients were imaged using ECAT EXACT or HR+ systems. All patients had non-attenuation-corrected scans, while transmission data for attenuation correction were also available for 12 patients (29%). PET correctly identified BAC in 41 of the 46 (89%) lesions and 39 of the 41 patients (95%). By pathology, 25 patients (61%) were found to have unifocal or nodular lesions; this pattern was correctly identified by PET in 20 patients (80%) and by CT in 18 (72%). PET correctly identified 7 (44%) of 16 patients (39%) who had multicentric or diffuse BAC, and CT identified 11 (69%). Of the 35 patients whose lymph node status was verified pathologically, PET was correct in 27 (77%) and CT in 24 (69%). PET missed 67% of the rare tumors that had a pure BAC pattern with no invasive component. It is concluded that the diagnostic performance of whole-body FDG-PET is similar in most patients with lesions with a BAC pattern and in other non-small cell lung cancer types. PET is less accurate in patients with rare BAC tumors that have no invasive component."

We then evaluated the usefulness of our classification on HRCT findings for predicting outcome and formulating a therapeutic strategy. Tumors were classified according to attenuation of on HRCT images as the 'air-containing type' or the 'solid-density type'. The air-containing type adenocarcinomas (n = 66) revealed no lymphnode involvement detected surgically or pathologically, and revealed minimal microscopic evidence of metastasis (pleural involvement, vascular invasion, or lymphatic permeation). Furthermore, the relapse-free and overall survival curves of the air-containing types revealed no relapses or deaths. Patients with solid-density type adenocarcinomas (n = 71), on the other hand, demonstrated a poor prognosis. Consequently, it seems likely that air-containing adenocarcinomas 20 mm or less in diameter on HRCT may be treated successfully by limited lung resection."
