Although silicone stenting of the collapsing airways is minimally invasive and usually effective, complications are common, and peak at the 3-week mark.

The protocols for both dynamic bronchoscopy and computed tomography scanning have been described in prior reports [2, 3, 8, 9]. We then analyzed all consecutive cases of TBP (surgical stabilization of the posterior membrane by prosthetic mesh splinting of the thoracic trachea and bronchi) performed during the study period.

The goal of the procedure is to stabilize the airway by suturing a knitted polypropylene mesh (ref. 0112670; C. R. Bard, Murray Hill, NJ) to the posterior membrane of the trachea and bilateral bronchi. We prefer 4.0 polypropylene sutures (30-inch, RB-1, catalog no. 8557H; Ethicon, Somerville, NJ) to secure the mesh, with each suture passed in partial thickness fashion so as not to enter the airway lumen. Although other groups have utilized absorbable sutures [6], we favor a permanent anchoring of the mesh with polypropylene, although admittedly, this is more preference than science (Fig 2). These anchoring sutures are placed in rows of four across the trachea and larger aspects of the bronchi; rows of three sutures are used in the smaller distal left mainstem bronchus and bronchus intermedius.

Splinting of the posterior airway membrane to reduce 'floppiness' of either the cartilaginous structure, membranous wall, or both, can be done with minimal mortality risk in patients with significant comorbidity utilizing the surgical technique of TBP we have presented. Active management of respiratory events in the postoperative period is important to help ensure good outcomes. It is an arduous operation and recuperation, with an average hospital stay of 8 days. Although nearly 75% of these patients were able to be discharged to their homes, nearly one quarter required a postoperative stint at a rehabilitation facility, which both underscores the magnitude of the recovery from TBP as well as reflects the comorbidities of the patients selected for this operation. A frank discussion of the risks and benefits of operation for this benign condition is imperative. We speculate that is possible that the decreased proportion of patients who respond to stenting and then proceed to tracheoplasty (94% in our earlier series [3]"

The mean reduction in tracheal expiratory cross-sectional area was nearly 55% in these study subjects despite the absence of signs or risk factors for TBM. This underscores the importance of careful case selection for TBP, as some degree of dynamic airway collapse can be a normal and expected finding. In our protocol for evaluation and treatment of TBM, only patients with severe cases of collapse (total or near-total) are considered for surgical correction. Moreover, performance of a stent trial before definitive surgical intervention provides an additional level of rigor to ensure that we attempt to operate on patients for whose symptoms their TBM is causative (or strongly contributory) and not simply correlative. One acknowledged shortcoming of this retrospective study is the inability to determine the exact cause of contraction from 99 patients who responded to the stent trial to 63 patients who eventually underwent surgery. It is likely that conservative surgical risk assessment as well as patient preference to avoid surgery account for this drop-off."

While anatomic evidence provided by postoperative bronchoscopy and dynamic computed tomography has shown striking improvement, amelioration of 'end-organ' effects such as decreased air trapping have not been demonstrated [16, 17]. With regard to dyspnea, the study did not show that FEV1 improved after TBP, as might have been expected from increased large airway conductance [18, 19]. Indeed, other investigators have reported improvement in FEV1 after surgical treatment of TBM in both the pediatric and adult populations [6, 20]. In close examination of these two reports, however, there are findings that might explain the discrepancy between our study and theirs. In the pediatric report, fewer than a third of the patients underwent FEV1 preoperative and postoperative testing [20]. In a group of children ranging in age from 3 weeks to 5 years, this type of testing might be difficult to obtain, and its validity questionable. The adult tracheobronchoplasty series included only 14 patients, and the mean improvement in FEV1 was greater than 200 mL in only 5 of these patients [6]. The lack of a clinically significant increase in FEV1 is consistent with our previous work examining both internal and external stabilization of the malacic airway [2, 3]. In addition, we have also shown that the degree of expiratory tracheal collapse does not correlate with airflow limitation in patients with TBM [8]."

For example, it has been shown that for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary rehabilitation alone may result in significant betterment of 6-minute walk distance, maximal work load, maximal oxygen uptake, and quality of life, but FEV1 is not increased, in keeping with our results [21]. Despite these concerns, we feel that the demonstrable improvement in anatomy contributes to the subjective improvement in dyspnea. Minimal increases in airflow may result in marked improvement in hyperinflation, dyspnea, and vital capacity, and it has been suggested that stabilization of the central airways might lead to more laminar flow accounting for this finding [18, 22]. This clearly deserves more extensive investigation going forward."

            "text": "The beneficial effects of this operation are not solely limited to airflow. However, it is difficult to measure objectively the beneficial effects of the operation on secretion retention or orthopnea. The prevalence of respiratory failure as a preoperative presentation of severe TBM is quite low, and therefore, is unlikely to provide much insight into the efficacy of the operation. Future work might be directed at obtaining the follow-up data in regard to cough and prevalence of respiratory infection after TBP. Unfortunately, these variables are prone to bias given their subjective nature. Recognition of other specific objective outcome measures might also improve the application of our institutional protocol, which calls for a stent trial before consideration of TBP. While the majority of patients have been shown to have dyspnea as a presenting symptom, cough and recurrent infections are prevalent as well [3]. These patients might not be expected to report marked subjective improvement after stent placement, and in fact, cough and secretion retention might be exacerbated by the stent, so that moving forward on the basis of a positive stent trial is not possible. More work remains to be done to identify more accurately which of these patients with cough or infection as primary complaints are most likely to benefit from TBP. Overall, our ability to accurately include all patients who are likely to benefit from TBP, and exclude those who will not, is still limited. This is suggested by the finding that both in our earlier work and in this study, the proportion of patients who are diagnosed with severe TBM and then respond positively to a stent trial remains at about 55%."

I think that is the obvious sticking point with this study and our previous studies with stent and surgical stabilization of the severely malacic airway-namely, that FEV1 is not seen to improve despite an intuitive expectation that it would. I don't pretend to be a respiratory physiologist, but one thing that has been pointed out to me is that the choke point, or the point where air flow is restricted, can actually occur in these patients before expiratory collapse. So there must be some function in that regard that would prevent FEV1 from being the perfect metric for improvement. There have been two studies looking at tracheoplasty or tracheobronchoplasty that actually have reported improvement in FEV1. One was in a pediatric population. The other was the series from the Massachusetts General Hospital of 14 adult patients. In neither of those studies is the improvement striking, meaning in the MGH series, only 5 of the 14 patients actually had an improvement greater than 200 mL of flow, and in the pediatric study, of 33 patients with a mean age of 1.2 years, only 8 patients were measured to have increased FEV1, while two thirds of the patients were not tested."

I think it is the type of operation that is best learned in a mentored setting. These operations span-and you can see the range-from 3 hours, but typically more like 6 to 8 hours, sometimes up to 10 hours in the operating room. The total number of sutures that we place in that back wall is usually"

Is it because you have been impressed with the other nonoperative interventions, such as stent development, or have you found that some of these patients can simply be treated well with a temporary stent?"

          {
            "text": "DR GANGADHARAN: I think the decreased proportion of patients who actually are operated on is explained by two things. The first is that I think we are applying our standards more rigorously to this population, and you can afford to do that if your referral base grows and you're seeing more and more of these patients. You can look at these patients as a whole and understand who really is not likely to benefit. So if somebody has an equivocal stent trial, meaning we placed a silicone Y-stent, and they say, 'You know, I feel a little bit better,' I push them and I say, 'Well, what does that mean? What can you do? Can you walk through the grocery store, can you check your mailbox where you hadn't been able to before, or are you just saying that you feel the air moving a little bit easier?' If it's only that they are feeling the air move a little bit easier, in a higher risk patient or somebody in whom the anatomy is not perfect, I'll typically sit back and make them prove that they will actually benefit. I think that's the first thing. You know, the bugaboo here is that dyspnea is easy to evaluate with a stent. If you place a stent and you prop the airway open and people feel better and they breathe better, that's a positive stent trial, but many of the patients are going to have intractable paroxysmal barking cough or recurrent infections as their main presenting complaint, and those patients obviously are not likely to have such a clear-cut benefit from stent trialing, and I think as we parse through these patients a little bit more carefully, that's why we have not offered it to as many of them."

With these large dissections, the presence of a foreign body, and extensive suturing of the airway, have these patients had problems with infection or airway ischemia?"

          {
            "text": "DR GANGADHARAN: Thank you for your questions. I will address them in order. In regard to the first question, whether we have seen improvement in the postoperative studies, we have previously reported the CT signs of improvement after intervention, and it's fairly striking that the patients had a recognizable change in their CT appearance. We also perform bronchoscopy on them, and although it's not reported here, the vast majority of the patients have bronchoscopic evidence of improvement. Now, I will say that that improvement can be mitigated by anatomic constraints. For example, some patients will have TBM beyond the level that is addressed with tracheobronchoplasty and beyond the level that is addressed with a silicone Y-stent, and so they will have persistent malacia in the smaller airways, in the lobar and segmental airways, but nonetheless, the reduction of turbulent flow in the central airways seems to still be beneficial."

            "text": "To answer your second question about the stenting, as you can see, there is a smaller cohort of patients who have chronic stents left in, and what that requires is very aggressive maintenance. We have also published our results with stents and found that when you leave a stent in for more than 2 weeks, those patients are going to have a complication in upward of 90% of the cases. So they are going to have a stent-related infection, they will plug, they have pneumonias or granulation tissue, and frank obstruction. So we tend not to recommend that in patients who otherwise are reasonable candidates, because surgery provides a better long-term functional result."

            "text": "In regard to the last question you had on ischemia, the dissection, as you allude to, does take into account that the blood supply is coming in laterally, so we try not to do any type of circumferential dissection. We stop at the cartilaginous-membranous junction just enough to be able to see that junction to place that stitch. With this approach, we have had only 1 patient who has had a stent erosion de novo. This patient was a vasculopathy, and I suspect that even a small amount of dissection was enough to create an ischemic airway. We had another patient who had had previous pediatric tracheal surgery for a TE fistula, and then had been reoperated on twice as an adult for malacia before our performing a tracheobronchoplasty. So that airway had been extensively dissected in the past, and the blood supply was quite tenuous, and that patient actually did have a membranous wall necrosis. But short of that, in most cases, adhering to the principle of staying on the back wall has avoided that type of complication."

            "text": "DR BRYAN F. MEYERS (St. Louis, MO): I must say I'm stuck at what you described as the 'sticking point,' which is the fact that there is really no measurable change in their exhaled pulmonary function that would serve as a solid objective measure. One of the problems with expanding this work is the very subjective nature of many steps in the evaluation. You do the bronchoscopy and you're looking at how the airway collapses, and maybe after you look at a bunch of them, you develop a sense of how it's collapsing. Then, whenyouinterview the patient after the stent was placed, you have a sense in talking to them about whether or not their stated improvement is enough or whether they use the right words to make you think that they are safe to go on to surgery. Afterward, they report improvements in subjective things, like quality of life, but don't have any measured improvement of airway function. If you look at the results on your FEV 1 , is there any heterogeneity in which there are some who have a great improvement and others who don't improve or actually are worse, or is everyone pretty much the same? I'm concerned that you might be just picking the most suggestible patients or the patients who are most eager to get better, and we have seen with valved airway stents for emphysema and with bronchial thermoplasty for asthma that things that look really good subjectively on a phase II study end up not showing as much promise when you randomize patients and have sham controls, which would be untenable in a 6-hour operation."
          },
          {
            "text": "DRGANGADHARAN: I think those are great points. I think the subjective nature of the observation is somewhat mitigated by the fact that we're not trying to gauge between 50% airway collapse-which is, as you know, the definition of tracheomalacia. We're not trying to differentiate between 50% and 75%. We're looking at 90%, 95%, 100% collapse. So that's a little bit more obvious to distinguish."
          },
          {
            "text": "Now, the subjective assessment of whether they had a stent response, you can make that same argument with patients who you are evaluating for a Nissen fundoplication. You talk to them and you say, 'Do you feel better when you get on proton pump inhibitors?' If they say yes, then you can talk to them a little bit about what the likelihood would be that they would benefit from an antireflux procedure. So that degree of subjectivity is very common to things that we do for functional benefit. In terms of the air flow itself, I think that we are still stuck looking for the correct outcome measure, because what you have suggested, that there is a placebo effect, that patients want to improve, is certainly one of the weaknesses. And while it's hard to understand that a placebo effect could persist through what is a fairly arduous perioperative course, it certainly could be the case. The other concern that we have is what if the adjunctive measures of postoperative recovery also are improving these patients, meaning we're focusing on getting their strength back, we're focusing on getting them physical therapy, we're focusing on working on their deep breathing, and all those things that actually in and of themselves could make somebody feel better. I think those are all very valid criticisms and certainly need to be addressed in further studies. As you suggest, a randomized trial of tracheobronchoplasty versus sham surgery is untenable, but it could be possible to randomize between rigid bronchoscopy and rigid bronchoscopy plus Y-stent placement. That could address some of the suggestibility and placebo concerns you raise."

Patients often have comorbidities, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and inappropriate treatment for these conditions may precede eventual recognition of TBM by months or years. Most of these patients have an acquired form of TBM in which the etiology in unknown. Diagnosis of TBM is made by airway computed tomography scan and flexible bronchoscopy with forced expiration. The prevailing definition of TBM as a 50% reduction in cross-sectional area is nonspecific, with a high proportion of healthy volunteers meeting this threshold. The clinically significant threshold is complete or near-complete collapse of the airway. Airway stenting may treat TBM, although complications resulting from indwelling prostheses often limit the durability of stents. Surgical stabilization of the airway by posterior splinting (tracheobronchoplasty) effectively and permanently corrects malacic airways. Proper surgical selection is facilitated by a short-term stent trial."

MATERIALS AND METHODS; Hospital records were reviewed to identify 10 consecutive patients with bronchoscopically proved TBM and 10 control subjects without TBM who underwent paired volumetric inspiratory and dynamic expiratory examinations with multisection CT. A low-dose (40-80 mA) technique was used for dynamic expiratory CT in 14 (70%) of the 20 subjects, and a standard dose (240-280 mA) was used in the remaining six (30%). All images were reviewed in a randomized, blinded fashion by two observers, who measured the tracheal lumen to determine the presence of TBM by consensus. The degree of confidence in measuring the tracheal lumen was graded on a four-point scale from 0(no confidence) to 3 (highest level of confidence), also by consensus of the two observers. Statistical analysis for differences in confidence level was performed with the Mann-Whitney U test. The image noise level was assessed by measuring the standard deviation of the presternal soft tissue, and statistical analysis for differences in noise level was performed with the t test."

The scores in both indexes depend on ratings for three different categories: functional impairment; magnitude of task, and magnitude of effort. At the baseline state, dyspnea was rated in five grades from 0 (severe) to 4 (unimpaired) for each category. The ratings for each of the three categories were added to form a baseline focal score (range, 0 to 12). At the transition period, changes in dyspnea were rated by seven grades, ranging from -3 (major deterioration), to +3 (major improvement). The ratings for each of the three categories were added to form a transition focal score (range, -9 to +9). In 38 patients tested with respiratory disease, interobserver agreement was highly satisfactory for both indexes. The baseline focal score had the highest correlation (r = 0.60; P less than 0.001) with the 12-minute walking distance (12 MW), while significant, but lower, correlations existed for lung function. For the transition focal score, there was a significant correlation only with the 12 MW (r = 0.33; p = 0.04). These results indicate that dyspnea can receive a direct clinical rating that provides important information not disclosed by customary physiologic tests."

        "abstract": "Functional status measurements are often difficult to interpret because small differences may be statistically significant but not clinically significant. How much does the Six Minute Walk test (6MW) need to differ to signify a noticeable difference in walking ability for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)? We studied individuals with stable COPD (n = 112, mean age = 67 yr, mean FEV1 = 975 ml) and estimated the smallest difference in 6MW distances that was associated with a noticeable difference in patients' subjective comparison ratings of their walking ability. We found that the 6MW was significantly correlated with patients' ratings of their walking ability relative to other patients (r = 0.59, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.54 to 0.63). Distances needed to differ by 54 m for the average patient to stop rating themselves as \"about the same\" and start rating themselves as either \"a little bit better\" or \"a little bit worse\" (95% CI: 37 to 71 m). We suggest that differences in functional status can be statistically significant but below the threshold at which patients notice a difference in themselves relative to others; an awareness of the smallest difference in walking distance that is noticeable to patients may help clinicians interpret the effectiveness of symptomatic treatments for COPD."

In contrast, 43 percent of the CAO patients demonstrated a curvilinear (C) pattern; the remainder (17 percent) were intermediate. Volume displacement plethysmography indicated that the airway collapse (AC) pattern was influenced by, but was not solely, a gas compression artifact. Airway collapse patients had more obstruction and hyperinflation than C patients and also had decreased diffusing capacity, absence of density dependence, reduced lung recoil, and no effort dependence of airflow. Bronchodilator administration in AC patients typically produced large reduction of residual volume and increase of vital capacity, with a smaller increase of airflow. These data suggest that AC patients have significant, partially reversible peripheral airways obstruction plus emphysema. Possible determinants of AC include reduced central airway support, increased peripheral resistance, loss of lung recoil, and increased pleural pressures during forced expiration. The MEFV contour appears to evolve from normal to curvilinear to the AC pattern as the severity of airflow obstruction worsens."

The pathogenetic features of this case were demonstrated immunohistopathologically using CD68, HLA-DR, UCHL1, L26 and Ki-67 antibodies. The principal features were (a) selective destruction of the cartilage with Ki-67 stainability from the trachea to the segmental bronchi with inflammatory infiltrations of predominant T lymphocytes (UCHL1-positive) and activated macrophages (CD68-positive with marked HLA class II antigen) and (b) replacement by collagen fibers through the affected lesion. The tissues, except for the cartilage in the airway tract, were preserved without marked change, including the membranous portion. The cartilage at organs other than the airway showed no changes. We first clarified the immunohistopathology of tracheobronchomalacia. We proposed that the characteristic cell-mediated immunity against cartilage with T lymphocytes and activated macrophages in the pathogenetic features may be related to a cancer-healing tendency."

Little is known about the aetiology of primary bronchomalacia, but this occurrence suggests that there may be a significant genetic component in some cases."

          "urement of improvement. While anatomic evidence provided by postoperative bronchoscopy and dynamic computed tomography has shown striking improvement, amelioration of 'end-organ' effects such as decreased air trapping have not been demonstrated [16, 17]. With regard to dyspnea, the study did not show that FEV1 improved after TBP, as might have been expected from increased large airway conductance [18, 19]. Indeed, other investigators have reported improvement in FEV1 after surgical treatment of TBM in both the pediatric and adult populations [6, 20]. In close examination of these two reports, however, there are findings that might explain the discrepancy between our study and theirs. In the pediatric report, fewer than a third of the patients underwent FEV1 preoperative and postoperative testing [20]. In a group of children ranging in age from 3 weeks to 5 years, this type of testing might be difficult to obtain, and its validity questionable. The adult tracheobronchoplasty series included only 14 patients, and the mean improvement in FEV1 was greater than 200 mL in only 5 of these patients [6]. The lack of a clinically significant increase in FEV1 is consistent with our previous work examining both internal and external stabilization of the malacic airway [2, 3]. In addition, we have also shown that the degree of expiratory tracheal collapse does not correlate with airflow limitation in patients with TBM [8].",
          "ver the subjective index reporting. There are possible confounding effects of the adjuncts to surgical recuperation (eg, a concentrated focus on ambulation and strength training, formal physical or respiratory therapy consultation, or stints in regular or pulmonary rehabilitation facilities) that in and of themselves could result in the improvements seen in this study, including both the subjective indices as well as exercise tolerance. For example, it has been shown that for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary rehabilitation alone may result in significant betterment of 6-minute walk distance, maximal work load, maximal oxygen uptake, and quality of life, but FEV1 is not increased, in keeping with our results [21]. Despite these concerns, we feel that the demonstrable improvement in anatomy contributes to the subjective improvement in dyspnea. Minimal increases in airflow may result in marked improvement in hyperinflation, dyspnea, and vital capacity, and it has been suggested that stabilization of the central airways might lead to more laminar flow accounting for this finding [18, 22]. This clearly deserves more extensive investigation going forward.",

With regard to dyspnea, the study did not show that FEV1 improved after TBP, as might have been expected from increased large airway conductance [18, 19]. Indeed, other investigators have reported improvement in FEV1 after surgical treatment of TBM in both the pediatric and adult populations [6, 20]. In close examination of these two reports, however, there are findings that might explain the discrepancy between our study and theirs. In the pediatric report, fewer than a third of the patients underwent FEV1 preoperative and postoperative testing [20]. In a group of children ranging in age from 3 weeks to 5 years, this type of testing might be difficult to obtain, and its validity questionable. The adult tracheobronchoplasty series included only 14 patients, and the mean improvement in FEV1 was greater than 200 mL in only 5 of these patients [6]. The lack of a clinically significant increase in FEV1 is consistent with our previous work examining both internal and external stabilization of the malacic airway [2, 3].

For example, it has been shown that for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary rehabilitation alone may result in significant betterment of 6-minute walk distance, maximal work load, maximal oxygen uptake, and quality of life, but FEV1 is not increased, in keeping with our results [21]. Despite these concerns, we feel that the demonstrable improvement in anatomy contributes to the subjective improvement in dyspnea.

          "urement of improvement. While anatomic evidence provided by postoperative bronchoscopy and dynamic computed tomography has shown striking improvement, amelioration of 'end-organ' effects such as decreased air trapping have not been demonstrated [16, 17]. With regard to dyspnea, the study did not show that FEV1 improved after TBP, as might have been expected from increased large airway conductance [18, 19]. Indeed, other investigators have reported improvement in FEV1 after surgical treatment of TBM in both the pediatric and adult populations [6, 20]. In close examination of these two reports, however, there are findings that might explain the discrepancy between our study and theirs. In the pediatric report, fewer than a third of the patients underwent FEV1 preoperative and postoperative testing [20]. In a group of children ranging in age from 3 weeks to 5 years, this type of testing might be difficult to obtain, and its validity questionable. The adult tracheobronchoplasty series included only 14 patients, and the mean improvement in FEV1 was greater than 200 mL in only 5 of these patients [6]. The lack of a clinically significant increase in FEV1 is consistent with our previous work examining both internal and external stabilization of the malacic airway [2, 3]. In addition, we have also shown that the degree of expiratory tracheal collapse does not correlate with airflow limitation in patients with TBM [8].",
          "ver the subjective index reporting. There are possible confounding effects of the adjuncts to surgical recuperation (eg, a concentrated focus on ambulation and strength training, formal physical or respiratory therapy consultation, or stints in regular or pulmonary rehabilitation facilities) that in and of themselves could result in the improvements seen in this study, including both the subjective indices as well as exercise tolerance. For example, it has been shown that for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary rehabilitation alone may result in significant betterment of 6-minute walk distance, maximal work load, maximal oxygen uptake, and quality of life, but FEV1 is not increased, in keeping with our results [21]. Despite these concerns, we feel that the demonstrable improvement in anatomy contributes to the subjective improvement in dyspnea. Minimal increases in airflow may result in marked improvement in hyperinflation, dyspnea, and vital capacity, and it has been suggested that stabilization of the central airways might lead to more laminar flow accounting for this finding [18, 22]. This clearly deserves more extensive investigation going forward.",
