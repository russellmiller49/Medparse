    "abstract": "Airway stents improve pulmonary function and quality of life in patients suffering from airway obstruction. The aim of this study was to compare main types of stents (silicone, balloon-dilated metal, self-expanding metal, and covered self-expanding metal) in terms of their mechanical properties and the radial forces they exert on the trachea. Mechanical measurements were carried out using a force gauge and specially designed adaptors fabricated in our lab. Numerical simulations were performed for eight different stent geometries, inserted into trachea models. The results show a clear correlation between stent diameter (oversizing) and the levels of stress it exerts on the trachea. Compared with uncovered metal stents, metal stents that are covered with less stiff material exert signiﬁcantly less stress on the trachea while still maintaining strong contact with it. The use of such stents may reduce formation of mucosa necrosis and ﬁstulas while still preventing stent migration. Silicone stents produce the lowest levels of stress, which may be due to weak contact between the stent and the trachea and can explain their propensity for migration. Unexpectedly, stents made of the same materials exerted different stresses due to differences in their structure. Stenosis signiﬁcantly increases stress levels in all stents.",

The aim of this study was to compare main types of stents (silicone, balloon-dilated metal, self-expanding metal, and covered self-expanding metal) in terms of their mechanical properties and the radial forces they exert on the trachea. Mechanical measurements were carried out using a force gauge and specially designed adaptors fabricated in our lab. Numerical simulations were performed for eight different stent geometries, inserted into trachea models. The results show a clear correlation between stent diameter (oversizing) and the levels of stress it exerts on the trachea. Compared with uncovered metal stents, metal stents that are covered with less stiff material exert significantly less stress on the trachea while still maintaining strong contact with it. The use of such stents may reduce formation of mucosa necrosis and fistulas while still preventing stent migration. Silicone stents produce the lowest levels of stress, which may be due to weak contact between the stent and the trachea and can explain their propensity for migration. Unexpectedly, stents made of the same materials exerted different stresses due to differences in their structure. Stenosis significantly increases stress levels in all stents."

Silicone stents can be easily removed and replaced as needed [4,5]. However, they have several major drawbacks, including a high migration rate, a low lumen-to-wall thickness ratio, difficulty in clearing secretions, and the need to carry out rigid bronchoscopy for their apposition [5-8]. Metallic stents, usually made of steel or nitinol, can be placed via flexible bronchoscopy,"

These stents lack the capacity for elastic re-expansion and therefore risk being crushed or becoming deformed with coughing; thus, they are not recommended for use in the central airways. However, they are often used in children, since they are available in sizes suitable for pediatric application [9]. Self-expanding metal stents have a shape memory that enables them to be restored to a predetermined configuration when released from a constraining delivery catheter [6]. These stents can be made of steel or nitinol and can either be uncovered or covered with thin polyurethane membranes. They are associated with lower likelihood of migration and less interface with cilia, and their walls are thinner, so their inner diameter is wider. However, they are difficult to remove due to the growth of airway epithelium around them, they can impair mucociliary clearance, are associated with recurrent lumen obstruction, with greater bacterial colonization and are also susceptible to metal fatigue and fracture over time [6,10,11]. Covered self-expanding metal stents are associated with a lower risk of tumor in-growth and granulation tissue formation. A disadvantage of this type of stent is that radial forces acting on the stent may cause necrosis of mucosa and fistula formation. These stents even collapse if the external force is too high, and granulation tissue at the uncovered ends may block the bronchus [10,3]."

During coughing these maximal and minimal values increase to 6 kPa and 7.25 kPa, respectively [12]. In the same study, stent-trachea models, silicone (Dumon) and metallic (Ultraflex), revealed that the presence of a stent prevents tracheal muscle deflections, especially during coughing. In addition, compared with the metallic stent-model, the silicone stent-model was shown to contain larger regions that are predisposed to sliding, leading to the conclusion that stent type selection plays an important role in improving clinical outcomes. Several numerical studies examined changes in airway flow and pressure during airway obstruction [13,14] and after stent placement [15]. Other studies employed finite element analysis to evaluate flow pattern, wall stress and deformation in healthy and stenosis trachea [16], to evaluate the influence of silicon stent-model on the trachea wall during inspiration and expiration [17] and to examine the influence of the same silicone stent-model on the trachea movement during swallowing [18]."

For each type of airway stent tested herein, the radial stress increased significantly with diameter. Although, stress level at 10% oversizing was the lowest observed in all stent types, the stress level is sufficient to ensure their apposition. Theseresults are comparable with blood vessel stent studies, in which there is a tendency to select stents that are oversized by 10% in order to ensure apposition without creating substantial wall stress [21]."

Previous studies, which investigated the influence of dumon silicon stent on the trachea wall during inspiration and expiration and during swallowing, found similar maximal stresses at peak flow [17,18]. Studies on blood vessel stents obtained similar results, showing that less-stiff stents exert less stress on artery walls [22]. Additionally, the relatively low stress levels observed in silicone airway stents may indicate weak contact with the trachea and can explain these stents' known propensity for migration along the airway paths. This proposition is supported by studies on arterial stents, which claimed that compliant stents may not provide adequate support and might be more susceptible to migration [23].",

A continuous geometric structure, type D (wallstent), was associated with lower stress levels compared with type C stents (zigzag; Fig. 7a and b) and types G and H stents (both square and triangle) even though all these stents were composed of the same stent material. An opposite phenomenon was observed in the case of covered metal stents: the stresses exerted on healthy trachea were significantly lower for the internally-covered metal stent (triangle, A) than for the externally-covered metal stent (wallstent, B). This unexpected outcome probably resulted from the positioning of the cover, which affects the stiffness of the stent. The externally-covered metal stent has a smoother surface and thus fewer areas of concentrated stress, however, it is denser and therefore stiffer, which increases the stress on the trachea. Nevertheless, this type of stent is still more recommended for use, since its contact with the trachea is uniform, and contact stresses are evenly distributed. The even distributions of the contacts and the stresses eliminate localized stresses, which may promote tissue growth around the stent [24].",

However, since the stents under evaluation either contain voids or are covered by silicone, their mechanical properties are affected not only by the stent material, but also by the voids and, in the covered stents, by the covering material. The combined effect makes the stents less stiff and with lower Young's moduli compared with the metal itself. Similarly, the results of the experiment clearly showed that elastic moduli were higher in covered metal stents than in uncovered metal stents; this finding can also be explained by the difference between the contribution of the voids to the stiffness when the voids are left empty and when they are filled by the covering material (silicone or PTFE). Accordingly, the covered stents are stiffer and have higher Young's modulus values. The silicone stent was distorted due to the radial forces; thus, a sharp reduction in stress was measured at the end of the stent's linear range (Fig. 4b and c).",

The aim of this study was to compare main types of stents (silicone, balloon-dilated metal, self-expanding metal, and covered self-expanding metal) in terms of their mechanical properties and the radial forces they exert on the trachea. Mechanical measurements were carried out using a force gauge and specially designed adaptors fabricated in our lab. Numerical simulations were performed for eight different stent geometries, inserted into trachea models. The results show a clear correlation between stent diameter (oversizing) and the levels of stress it exerts on the trachea. Compared with uncovered metal stents, metal stents that are covered with less stiff material exert signiﬁcantly less stress on the trachea while still maintaining strong contact with it. The use of such stents may reduce formation of mucosa necrosis and ﬁstulas while still preventing stent migration. Silicone stents produce the lowest levels of stress, which may be due to weak contact between the stent and the trachea and can explain their propensity for migration. Unexpectedly, stents made of the same materials exerted different stresses due to differences in their structure. Stenosis signiﬁcantly increases stress levels in all stents.",

        "abstract": "Endobronchial interventions including the deployment of endobronchial stents have a clear role in the management of central airway problems. The use of endobronchial stents has rapidly increased since the first airway stent was developed in the 1960s and with the subsequent manufacture of improved silicone and metallic stents. They provide effective relief for symptoms of intrinsic and extrinsic airway obstruction secondary to a wide range of pathologies including lung cancer, lymphoma, thyroid carcinoma and benign disease such as tracheal strictures and tracheobronchomalacia. Endobronchial stents can also seal defects within the airway including malignant broncho-oesophageal fistulae and posterior wall tracheal tears. They can be placed safely under conscious sedation at flexible bronchoscopy or under general anaesthetic at rigid bronchoscopy. Rigid bronchoscopy under general anaesthesia provided by a multidisciplinary team is safe with few contraindications. Complications of endobronchial stents include infection, granulation tissue formation and metallic stent fracture sometimes requiring removal, although serious life-threatening complications are very rare. Increasing numbers of patients are being referred to specialist centres for airway intervention. This article reviews the history of endobronchial stents, the different stents available, and the indications, outcomes and complications involved in deploying endobronchial stents."

Fistulas between trachea or bronchi and the esophagus and dehiscence of pneumonectomy stump can be protected with covered stents. Choice of stent depends on careful patient selection, characteristics of airway stenosis, physician's expertise, and availability of equipment.

Tracheobronchial disorders can be caused by malignant or benign tumors, extrinsic compression, postintubation tracheal injuries, tracheobronchomalacia, or sequelae after tracheostomy. Tracheobronchial prostheses, known as airway stents, are used to palliate the effects of large airway obstruction. Specially designed stents are being used increasingly, not only in the airways, but also in the biliary tree, esophagus, urinary tract, and vascular system. There are two main types of airway stents currently available; tube stents made of silicone, and expandable metallic stents. Silicone stents are usually placed with the aid of a rigid bronchoscope while the patient is under general anesthesia. Unlike silicone stents, metal stents can be placed with a flexible bronchoscope. We examine the advantages and disadvantages of currently available stents and present our thoughts on the future development of airway stenting."

        "abstract": "Airway obstruction in children is a rare, but difficult clinical problem, with no clear agreement on optimal therapeutic approach. Stenting of the airway has been used successfully in adults, and is an attractive alternative in children. Fundamental differences of pediatric compared to adult use include the benign nature of most stenoses, the narrow and soft airways of children, the required long-term tolerance and adaptation to growth. These differences may significantly alter the therapeutic balance, calling into question the precise role stents play in the treatment of airway obstruction in children. Stent placement can be technically demanding but is not exceedingly difficult. Experience is necessary to select the proper size and type of stent. Metal stents usually achieve airway patency and clinical improvement in the majority of cases, while this is less frequently the case with silicone stents. Some complications such as granulation and secretion retention seem to occur in most children after stent implantation. Unfortunately, severe complications including death have been reported in a significant proportion of children. Stent related mortality can be estimated at 12.9% from published data, but these include complication centered reports. The initial euphoria for airway stents in children has largely abated and most authors agree that they should only be employed in circumstances with no good alternatives. It is crucial that all surgical and medical alternatives are considered and the decision to place a stent is not made because other options are overlooked or not available locally. Stent use in a palliative setting has also been reported and is probably reasonable. Stents will only allow limited adaptation for the growth of pediatric airways by balloon dilatation. All metal stents should be considered as potentially permanent, and removal sometimes may only be possible through a surgical and sometimes risky approach."

        "abstract": "Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis was used to model the effect of airway geometry on internal pressure in the upper airway of three children with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), and three controls. Model geometry was reconstructed from magnetic resonance images obtained during quiet tidal breathing, meshed with an unstructured grid, and solved at normative peak resting flow. The unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations were solved with steady flow boundary conditions in inspiration and expiration, using a two-equation low-Reynolds number turbulence model. Model results were validated using an in-vitro scale model, unsteady flow simulation, and reported nasal resistance measurements in children. Pharynx pressure drop strongly correlated to airway area restriction. Inspiratory pressure drop was primarily proportional to the square of flow, consistent with pressure losses due to convective acceleration caused by area restriction. On inspiration, in OSAS pressure drop occurred primarily between the choanae and the region where the adenoids overlap the tonsils (overlap region) due to airway narrowing, rather than in the nasal passages; in controls the majority of pressure drop was in the nasal passages. On expiration, in OSAS the majority of pressure drop occurred between the oropharynx (posterior to the tongue) and overlap region, and local minimum pressure in the overlap region was near atmospheric due to pressure recovery in the anterior nasopharynx. The results suggest that pharyngeal airway shape in children with OSAS significantly affects internal pressure distribution compared to nasal resistance. The model may also help explain regional dynamic airway narrowing during expiration."

An endotracheal stent is the common treatment for tracheal diseases such as stenosis, chronic cough, or dispnoea episodes. Medical treatment and surgical techniques are still challenging due to the difficulties in overcoming potential complications after prosthesis implantation. A finite element model of a diseased and stented trachea was developed starting from a patient specific computerized tomography (CT) scan. The tracheal wall was modeled as a fiber reinforced hyperelastic material in which we modeled the anisotropy due to the orientation of the collagen fibers. Deformations of the tracheal cartilage rings and of the muscular membrane, as well as the maximum principal stresses, are analyzed using a fluid solid interaction (FSI) approach. For this reason, as boundary conditions, impedance-based pressure waveforms were computed modeling the nonreconstructed vessels as a binary fractal network. The results showed that the presence of the stent prevents tracheal muscle deflections and indicated a local recirculatory flow on the stent top surface which may play a role in the process of mucous accumulation. The present work gives new insight into clinical procedures, predicting their mechanical consequences. This tool could be used in the future as preoperative planning software to help the thoracic surgeons in deciding the optimal prosthesis type as well as its size and positioning."

        "abstract": "Stent sizing and apposition have been shown to be important determinants of clinical outcome. This study evaluates the mechanical effects of undersizing and oversizing of stents on endothelial wall shear stress (WSS) and vessel wall stress to determine a possible biomechanical mechanism of in-stent restenosis and thrombosis. Three-dimensional computational models of stents, artery, and internal fluid were created in a computer-assisted design package, meshed, and solved in finite element and computational fluid dynamic packages. The simulation results show that the effects of various degrees of undersizing on WSS, WSS gradient, and oscillatory shear index were highly nonlinear. As the degree of undersizing increased, the heterogeneity of WSS became smaller. The WSS distribution for the 20% undersizing was smooth and uniform, whereas the 5% case was very heterogeneous. The combination of lower WSS and higher WSS gradient and oscillatory shear index in the 5% undersized case may induce neointimal hyperplasia or thrombosis. Additionally, the oversizing simulation results show that the maximum intramural wall stress of the 20% oversizing case is significantly larger than the maximum stress for the 10% and zero oversizing cases. Edge stress concentration was observed, consistent with the restenosis typically observed in this region. This study demonstrates that proper sizing of stent is important for reducing the hemodynamic and mechanical disturbances to the vessel wall. Furthermore, the present findings may be used to improve stent design to reduce endothelial flow disturbances and intramural wall stress concentrations."

        "abstract": "The biomechanical interaction of stents and the arteries into which they are deployed is a potentially important consideration for long-term success. Adverse arterial reactions to excessive stress and the resulting damage have been linked to the development of restenosis. Complex geometric features often encountered in these procedures can confound treatment. In some cases, it is desirable to deploy a stent across a region in which the diameter decreases significantly over the length of the stent. This study aimed to assess the final arterial diameter and circumferential stress in tapered arteries into which two different stents were deployed (one stiff and one less stiff). The artery wall was assumed to be made of a strain stiffening material subjected to large deformations, with a 10% decrease in diameter over the length of the stent. A commercially available finite element code was employed to solve the contact problem between the two elastic bodies. The stiffer stent dominated over arterial taper, resulting in a nearly constant final diameter along the length of the stent, and very high stresses, particularly at the distal end. The less stiff stent followed more closely the tapered contour of the artery, resulting in lower artery wall stresses. More compliant stents should be considered for tapered artery applications, perhaps even to the exclusion of tapered stents."

Technical issues, such as open versus closed cells, scaffolding, trackability, foreshortening, and changes in local geometry and hemodynamics, affect stent performance. Previous clinical and experimental studies have evaluated current stent models while proposing and testing novel stent designs. This review focuses on the technical aspects of carotid stent design and the clinical significance of key design parameters identified via computational and experimental modeling."

They are associated with lower likelihood of migration and less interface with cilia, and their walls are thinner, so their inner diameter is wider. However, they are difficult to remove due to the growth of airway epithelium around them, they can impair mucociliary clearance, are associated with recurrent lumen obstruction, with greater bacterial colonization and are also susceptible to metal fatigue and fracture over time [6,10,11]. Covered self-expanding metal stents are associated with a lower risk of tumor in-growth and granulation tissue formation. A disadvantage of this type of stent is that radial forces acting on the stent may cause necrosis of mucosa and fistula formation.

These stents lack the capacity for elastic re-expansion and therefore risk being crushed or becoming deformed with coughing; thus, they are not recommended for use in the central airways. However, they are often used in children, since they are available in sizes suitable for pediatric application [9].

          "rachea has shown that the trachea wall is subjected to maximal stress levels of 3.3 kPa in tension (inspiration) and 5.25 kPa in compression (expiration). During coughing these maximal and minimal values increase to 6 kPa and 7.25 kPa, respectively [12]. In the same study, stent-trachea models, silicone (Dumon) and metallic (Ultraflex), revealed that the presence of a stent prevents tracheal muscle deflections, especially during coughing. In addition, compared with the metallic stent-model, the silicone stent-model was shown to contain larger regions that are predisposed to sliding, leading to the conclusion that stent type selection plays an important role in improving clinical outcomes. Several numerical studies examined changes in airway flow and pressure during airway obstruction [13,14] and after stent placement [15]. Other studies employed finite element analysis to evaluate flow pattern, wall stress and deformation in healthy and stenosis trachea [16], to evaluate the influence of silicon stent-model on the trachea wall during inspiration and expiration [17] and to examine the influence of the same silicone stent-model on the trachea movement during swallowing [18].",

In both categories of stents, stents composed of stiffer silicone exerted higher stress levels ( E = 160 GPa and E = 1 MPa, respectively). The stress levels exerted by the covered stents (Fig. 7e) were lower than those of the uncovered stents.

The airway stents simulated in the present study were oversized by 10-12% in the healthy trachea and by 15-17% in the stenotic tracheas. For each type of airway stent tested herein, the radial stress increased significantly with diameter. Although, stress level at 10% oversizing was the lowest observed in all stent types, the stress level is sufficient to ensure their apposition. Theseresults are comparable with blood vessel stent studies, in which there is a tendency to select stents that are oversized by 10% in order to ensure apposition without creating substantial wall stress [21].",

The fact that the stress levels under symmetric stenosis did not differ significantly from those under non-symmetric stenosis (Fig. 4) may be due to the relatively low percentage of stenosis modeled in the present study.

Self-expanding metal stents have a shape memory that enables them to be restored to a predetermined configuration when released from a constraining delivery catheter [6]. These stents can be made of steel or nitinol and can either be uncovered or covered with thin polyurethane membranes. They are associated with lower likelihood of migration and less interface with cilia, and their walls are thinner, so their inner diameter is wider. However, they are difficult to remove due to the growth of airway epithelium around them, they can impair mucociliary clearance, are associated with recurrent lumen obstruction, with greater bacterial colonization and are also susceptible to metal fatigue and fracture over time [6,10,11]. Covered self-expanding metal stents are associated with a lower risk of tumor in-growth and granulation tissue formation. A disadvantage of this type of stent is that radial forces acting on the stent may cause necrosis of mucosa and fistula formation. These stents even collapse if the external force is too high, and granulation tissue at the uncovered ends may block the bronchus [10,3]."

These stents lack the capacity for elastic re-expansion and therefore risk being crushed or becoming deformed with coughing; thus, they are not recommended for use in the central airways. However, they are often used in children, since they are available in sizes suitable for pediatric application [9].

          "rachea has shown that the trachea wall is subjected to maximal stress levels of 3.3 kPa in tension (inspiration) and 5.25 kPa in compression (expiration).

Self-expanding metal stents have a shape memory that enables them to be restored to a predetermined configuration when released from a constraining delivery catheter [6].

These stents lack the capacity for elastic re-expansion and therefore risk being crushed or becoming deformed with coughing; thus, they are not recommended for use in the central airways. However, they are often used in children, since they are available in sizes suitable for pediatric application [9]. Self-expanding metal stents have a shape memory that enables them to be restored to a predetermined configuration when released from a constraining delivery catheter [6]. These stents can be made of steel or nitinol and can either be uncovered or covered with thin polyurethane membranes. They are associated with lower likelihood of migration and less interface with cilia, and their walls are thinner, so their inner diameter is wider. However, they are difficult to remove due to the growth of airway epithelium around them, they can impair mucociliary clearance, are associated with recurrent lumen obstruction, with greater bacterial colonization and are also susceptible to metal fatigue and fracture over time [6,10,11]. Covered self-expanding metal stents are associated with a lower risk of tumor in-growth and granulation tissue formation. A disadvantage of this type of stent is that radial forces acting on the stent may cause necrosis of mucosa and fistula formation. These stents even collapse if the external force is too high, and granulation tissue at the uncovered ends may block the bronchus [10,3].",

These stents lack the capacity for elastic re-expansion and therefore risk being crushed or becoming deformed with coughing; thus, they are not recommended for use in the central airways. However, they are often used in children, since they are available in sizes suitable for pediatric application [9]. Self-expanding metal stents have a shape memory that enables them to be restored to a predetermined configuration when released from a constraining delivery catheter [6]. These stents can be made of steel or nitinol and can either be uncovered or covered with thin polyurethane membranes. They are associated with lower likelihood of migration and less interface with cilia, and their walls are thinner, so their inner diameter is wider. However, they are difficult to remove due to the growth of airway epithelium around them, they can impair mucociliary clearance, are associated with recurrent lumen obstruction, with greater bacterial colonization and are also susceptible to metal fatigue and fracture over time [6,10,11]. Covered self-expanding metal stents are associated with a lower risk of tumor in-growth and granulation tissue formation. A disadvantage of this type of stent is that radial forces acting on the stent may cause necrosis of mucosa and fistula formation. These stents even collapse if the external force is too high, and granulation tissue at the uncovered ends may block the bronchus [10,3].",

During coughing these maximal and minimal values increase to 6 kPa and 7.25 kPa, respectively [12]. In the same study, stent-trachea models, silicone (Dumon) and metallic (Ultraflex), revealed that the presence of a stent prevents tracheal muscle deflections, especially during coughing. In addition, compared with the metallic stent-model, the silicone stent-model was shown to contain larger regions that are predisposed to sliding, leading to the conclusion that stent type selection plays an important role in improving clinical outcomes. Several numerical studies examined changes in airway flow and pressure during airway obstruction [13,14] and after stent placement [15].

These stents lack the capacity for elastic re-expansion and therefore risk being crushed or becoming deformed with coughing; thus, they are not recommended for use in the central airways. However, they are often used in children, since they are available in sizes suitable for pediatric application [9]. Self-expanding metal stents have a shape memory that enables them to be restored to a predetermined configuration when released from a constraining delivery catheter [6]. These stents can be made of steel or nitinol and can either be uncovered or covered with thin polyurethane membranes. They are associated with lower likelihood of migration and less interface with cilia, and their walls are thinner, so their inner diameter is wider. However, they are difficult to remove due to the growth of airway epithelium around them, they can impair mucociliary clearance, are associated with recurrent lumen obstruction, with greater bacterial colonization and are also susceptible to metal fatigue and fracture over time [6,10,11]. Covered self-expanding metal stents are associated with a lower risk of tumor in-growth and granulation tissue formation. A disadvantage of this type of stent is that radial forces acting on the stent may cause necrosis of mucosa and fistula formation. These stents even collapse if the external force is too high, and granulation tissue at the uncovered ends may block the bronchus [10,3].",

A stress-strain curve was obtained for each stent under evaluation, under a range of radially applied forces. Specifically, each of the tested stents was placed with its adaptor in the force gauge, and a gradually increasing radial force was applied to the stent until the adaptor tore. The measured parameters were vertical forces and vertical displacements. The radial stress σ was calculated based on the force data as follows:"

These stents lack the capacity for elastic re-expansion and therefore risk being crushed or becoming deformed with coughing; thus, they are not recommended for use in the central airways. However, they are often used in children, since they are available in sizes suitable for pediatric application [9]. Self-expanding metal stents have a shape memory that enables them to be restored to a predetermined configuration when released from a constraining delivery catheter [6]. These stents can be made of steel or nitinol and can either be uncovered or covered with thin polyurethane membranes. They are associated with lower likelihood of migration and less interface with cilia, and their walls are thinner, so their inner diameter is wider. However, they are difficult to remove due to the growth of airway epithelium around them, they can impair mucociliary clearance, are associated with recurrent lumen obstruction, with greater bacterial colonization and are also susceptible to metal fatigue and fracture over time [6,10,11]. Covered self-expanding metal stents are associated with a lower risk of tumor in-growth and granulation tissue formation. A disadvantage of this type of stent is that radial forces acting on the stent may cause necrosis of mucosa and fistula formation. These stents even collapse if the external force is too high, and granulation tissue at the uncovered ends may block the bronchus [10,3].",
          "rachea has shown that the trachea wall is subjected to maximal stress levels of 3.3 kPa in tension (inspiration) and 5.25 kPa in compression (expiration). During coughing these maximal and minimal values increase to 6 kPa and 7.25 kPa, respectively [12]. In the same study, stent-trachea models, silicone (Dumon) and metallic (Ultraflex), revealed that the presence of a stent prevents tracheal muscle deflections, especially during coughing. In addition, compared with the metallic stent-model, the silicone stent-model was shown to contain larger regions that are predisposed to sliding, leading to the conclusion that stent type selection plays an important role in improving clinical outcomes. Several numerical studies examined changes in airway flow and pressure during airway obstruction [13,14] and after stent placement [15]. Other studies employed finite element analysis to evaluate flow pattern, wall stress and deformation in healthy and stenosis trachea [16], to evaluate the influence of silicon stent-model on the trachea wall during inspiration and expiration [17] and to examine the influence of the same silicone stent-model on the trachea movement during swallowing [18].",

These stents lack the capacity for elastic re-expansion and therefore risk being crushed or becoming deformed with coughing; thus, they are not recommended for use in the central airways. However, they are often used in children, since they are available in sizes suitable for pediatric application [9]. Self-expanding metal stents have a shape memory that enables them to be restored to a predetermined configuration when released from a constraining delivery catheter [6]. These stents can be made of steel or nitinol and can either be uncovered or covered with thin polyurethane membranes. They are associated with lower likelihood of migration and less interface with cilia, and their walls are thinner, so their inner diameter is wider. However, they are difficult to remove due to the growth of airway epithelium around them, they can impair mucociliary clearance, are associated with recurrent lumen obstruction, with greater bacterial colonization and are also susceptible to metal fatigue and fracture over time [6,10,11]. Covered self-expanding metal stents are associated with a lower risk of tumor in-growth and granulation tissue formation. A disadvantage of this type of stent is that radial forces acting on the stent may cause necrosis of mucosa and fistula formation. These stents even collapse if the external force is too high, and granulation tissue at the uncovered ends may block the bronchus [10,3].",

During coughing these maximal and minimal values increase to 6 kPa and 7.25 kPa, respectively [12]. In the same study, stent-trachea models, silicone (Dumon) and metallic (Ultraflex), revealed that the presence of a stent prevents tracheal muscle deflections, especially during coughing. In addition, compared with the metallic stent-model, the silicone stent-model was shown to contain larger regions that are predisposed to sliding, leading to the conclusion that stent type selection plays an important role in improving clinical outcomes. Several numerical studies examined changes in airway flow and pressure during airway obstruction [13,14] and after stent placement [15]. Other studies employed finite element analysis to evaluate flow pattern, wall stress and deformation in healthy and stenosis trachea [16], to evaluate the influence of silicon stent-model on the trachea wall during inspiration and expiration [17] and to examine the influence of the same silicone stent-model on the trachea movement during swallowing [18].",

Both the studded silicone and the smooth silicone stents exerted lower stress levels compared to the metal stents (Fig. 7c and d). In both categories of stents, stents composed of stiffer silicone exerted higher stress levels ( E = 160 GPa and E = 1 MPa, respectively). The stress levels exerted by the covered stents (Fig. 7e) were lower than those of the uncovered stents. Stents covered with PTFE exerted higher stress levels than did those with a silicone cover ( E = 410 MPa and E = 2.5 MPa, respectively).",

The airway stents simulated in the present study were oversized by 10-12% in the healthy trachea and by 15-17% in the stenotic tracheas. For each type of airway stent tested herein, the radial stress increased significantly with diameter. Although, stress level at 10% oversizing was the lowest observed in all stent types, the stress level is sufficient to ensure their apposition. Theseresults are comparable with blood vessel stent studies, in which there is a tendency to select stents that are oversized by 10% in order to ensure apposition without creating substantial wall stress [21].",

The fact that the stress levels under symmetric stenosis did not differ significantly from those under non-symmetric stenosis (Fig. 4) may be due to the relatively low percentage of stenosis modeled in the present study. A higher percentage of stenosis would most likely increase the differences in stress levels between the symmetric and asymmetric cases [25]."
