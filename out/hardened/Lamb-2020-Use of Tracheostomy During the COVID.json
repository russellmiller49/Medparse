    "abstract": "This consensus statement on tracheostomy is intended to offer guidance in the decision-making, preparation, timing, techniques, and postprocedural care of patients with COVID-19-related respiratory failure. We think we addressed the most common questions being faced by physicians during this pandemic pertinent to the practice of tracheostomy. One of the strengths of this expert panel report is that it represents the opinions and perspectives of intensive care and interventional pulmonary experts from 10 states with the highest burden of COVID-19 in the United States. The recommendations presented may change as more experience and data are collected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of the urgency of this situation, information needs to be made available to provide physicians general recommendations based on limited published data and panel ' s expertise. This statement should be considered a living document that could be updated in the future in a timely manner as new evidence becomes available.

There is little we can infer from case series published during the 2003 SARS outbreak because the timing of the procedure was not documented. 6 The initial experience from New York University Langone Health suggests the feasibility and safety of a modi /uniFB01 ed bedside PDT performed at a mean of 10 days from intubation in patients with con /uniFB01 rmed COVID-19. After a mean follow-up posttracheostomy of 11 days, 33% of patients were liberated from mechanical ventilation. 7 Early tracheostomy in carefully selected patients with COVID19 may optimize ICU resources in a system that is experiencing an escalating number of critically ill patients. Faster liberation from mechanical ventilation and discharge from the ICU along with decreased use of neuromuscular blocking agents and sedatives may be helpful in circumstances where there are critical resource constraints. In addition, because viral clearance is slower in critically ill patients, the risk of transmission of infection to HCWs should not be the main basis for deciding between early or late tracheostomy. 3,10,12 In a study of hospitalized patients, median duration of viral shedding, as detected in upper respiratory specimens,"

In these position or perspective papers, PDT is considered a procedure that involves more extensive airway manipulation because it uses bronchoscopy and dilation of the tracheal intercartilaginous space. These factors may indeed result in an increased aerosolization risk and exposure to the operators and ancillary personnel. 6 On the other hand, PDT is a procedure that offers the ease of performing it in the ICU in a negative pressure (NP) room, minimizing the risk associated with transporting a patient with COVID-19 to the operating room. PDT generally results in less bleeding and therefore less need for cautery (often needed with OST), which itself carries a risk of aerosolizing particles. 42 PDT typically may require fewer HCWs involved in the procedure when compared with OST. Finally, the role of ultrasonography has been highlighted as a tool during PDT in patients with COVID-19, thereby reducing the need for bronchoscopic guidance with its potential risk of aerosolization. In fact, three pre-COVID-19 studies demonstrated shorter procedure duration and lower hemorrhage using ultrasound compared with bronchoscopic guidance during PDT. 36-39",

This measure minimizes the concentration of aerosol inside the room, which leads to less exposure of the operators and less aerosol dissemination outside the room when the door is opened.
