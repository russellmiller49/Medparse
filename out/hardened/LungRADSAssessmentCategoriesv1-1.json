The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated a 20% reduction in lung-cancer-related mortality with the use of lowdose lung cancer screening (LCS) CT in high-risk patients [1,2]. More recent data from the randomized controlled Dutch-Belgian Randomized Lung Cancer Screening Trial (NELSON) and Multicentric Italian Lung Detection trial reaf /uniFB01 rm the utility of LCS CT, reporting lung-cancerspeci /uniFB01 c mortality reductions of up to 26% and 39%, respectively [3,4]. In conjunction with the CMS approval for coverage of LCS CT in eligible patients, the ACR released the Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) v1.0 in 2014 to standardize LCS CT reporting, provide consistent management guidance, and facilitate outcomes monitoring [5]."

There has been widespread adoption of Lung-RADS for LCS CT reporting throughout the United States as the only CMS-approved reporting and classi /uniFB01 cation system for LCS.

In evaluating International Early Lung Cancer Action Program data, Farooqi et al found that of 706 patients with lung cancers, 3.6% were associated with cysts at either baseline or follow-up LCS [21]. A study of 441 patients diagnosed with primary lung cancer found that 9.3% were associated with cystic components at initial CT imaging [22]. Furthermore, cancers associated with cysts are more likely to be missed at initial screening than those presenting as isolated nodules. In a NELSON analysis, 22% of missed cancers at initial screening were associated with cystic spaces [23]."

Such nodules are considered benign and likely to represent intrapulmonary lymph nodes with several studies indicating a 0% incidence of malignancy [28,29]. New studies indicate that up to 32% of solid nodules 6 to 10 mm in mean diameter are juxtapleural (peri /uniFB01 ssural, costal pleural, perimediastinal, or peridiaphragmatic) and that no juxtapleural nodules were malignant when applying similar size and morphologic criteria as those used for peri /uniFB01 ssural nodules [30-32]. Of note, some of the analyses used a 10mm mean diameter (average of longand short-axis diameters) rather than a single maximum diameter threshold; Lung-RADS v2022 criteria have been updated accordingly. Available data indicate that expanding peri /uniFB01 ssural classi /uniFB01 -cation and management recommendations to all juxtapleural nodules, regardless of location, reduces false-positive rates and increases Lung-RADS speci /uniFB01 city without a decrease in sensitivity (Fig. 5).",

Likewise, slowgrowing nodules that increase in size < 1.5 mm each year may be missed by prior Lung-RADS criteria. However, using a /uniFB01 xed dimension and time interval for assessing growth is not without limitations. For example, an increase of > 1.5 mm can represent a more signi /uniFB01 cant increase in size and volume in a small nodule than for similar growth in a large nodule; notwithstanding, growing small nodules are often still typically below the size threshold for biopsy or PET/CT characterization and may be safely managed by current Lung-RADS criteria.

A previous Cochrane Review found limited evidence for the effectiveness of lung cancer screening with chest radiography (CXR) or sputum cytology in reducing lung cancer-related mortality, however there has been increasing evidence supporting screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT).&#xa0; OBJECTIVES: To determine whether screening for lung cancer using LDCT of the chest reduces lung cancer-related mortality and to evaluate the possible harms of LDCT screening."

        "abstract": "Background The American College of Radiology updated Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) version 1.0 to version 1.1 in May 2019, with the two key changes involving perifissural nodules (PFNs) and ground-glass nodules (GGNs) now designated as a negative screening result. This study examines the effects of these changes using National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) data. Purpose To determine the frequency of PFNs and GGNs reclassified from category 3 or 4A to the more benign category 2 in the updated Lung-RADS version 1.1, as compared with Lung-RADS version 1.0, using CT scans from the NLST. Materials and Methods In this secondary analysis of the NLST, the authors studied all noncalcified nodules (NCNs) found on the incident scan. Nodules were evaluated using criteria from both Lung-RADS version 1.0 and version 1.1, which were compared to determine changes in the number of nodules deemed benign. A McNemar test was used to assess statistical significance. Results A total of 2813 patients (mean age &#xb1; standard deviation, 62 years &#xb1; 5; 1717 men) with 4408 NCNs were studied. Of the largest 1092 solid NCNs measuring at least 6 mm but less than 10 mm, 216 (19.8%) were deemed PFNs (category 2) using Lung-RADS version 1.1. Eleven of the 1092 solid NCNs (1.0%) were malignant, but none were PFNs. Of 161 GGNs, three (1.9%) were category 3 according to Lung-RADS version 1.0, of which two (66.7%) were down-classified to category 2 with version 1.1. One of the three down-categorized GGNs (version 1.1) proved to be malignant (false-negative finding). Statistically significant improvement for Lung-RADS version 1.1 was found for total nodules (<i>P</i> &lt; .01) and PFNs (<i>P</i> &lt; .01), but not GGNs (<i>P</i> = .48). Conclusion This secondary analysis of National Lung Screening Trial data shows that Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System version 1.1 decreased the number of false-positive results. This was related to the down-classification of perifissural nodules in the range of 6 up to 10 mm. The increase in allowable nodule size for ground-glass nodules in category 2 from 20 mm (version 1.0) to 30 mm (version 1.1) showed no benefit. &#xa9; RSNA, 2021 See also the editorial by Mayo and Lam in this issue."

        "abstract": "<b>BACKGROUND.</b> Lung cancer (LC) associated with cystic airspaces is an uncommon presentation that is underrecognized on imaging. Additionally, understanding of its underlying pathology and risk factors is limited, which can contribute to delays in diagnosis. <b>OBJECTIVE.</b> The purpose of this analysis was to systematically review, analyze, and synthesize the medical literature to determine the imaging features of LC associated with cystic airspaces. <b>EVIDENCE ACQUISITION.</b> In accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we included published research reporting the clinical, pathologic, and imaging features of LC associated with cystic airspaces. We then performed a pooled analysis of continuous and categoric data with respect to patient clinical characteristics, tumor pathologic features, underlying driver mutation, CT features, and evolution of these features over time. <b>EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS.</b> The analysis included eight original observational studies with a combined total of 341 patients with LC associated with cystic airspaces (weighted mean age, 61.8 years; range, 30-87 years; 135 women and 206 men). Most patients were current or previous smokers (127/192 [66.1%]). The most common histologic finding was adenocarcinoma (289/328 [88.1%]) followed by squamous cell carcinoma (30/328 [9.1%]). The most common driver mutations were <i>EGFR</i> (46/122 [37.7%]) and <i>KRAS</i> (21/122 [17.2%]). The cysts in LC associated with cystic airspaces commonly had nonuniform (104/114 [91.2%]) and thick (83/222 [37.4%]) walls, irregular margins (53/142 [37.3%]), and were unilocular (173/272 [63.6%]). Most cysts had a nodular component (210/328 [64.0%]). Over time, most cysts showed development or enlargement of the nodular component (61/89 [68.5%]), approximately half showed wall thickening (43/89 [48.3%]), and a minority evolved into completely solid lesions (11/89 [12.4%]). The size of the cystic component increased in 36 of 89 patients (40.4%), decreased in 28 (31.5%), and remained stable in 24 (27.0%). <b>CONCLUSION.</b> LC associated with cystic airspaces occurs most commonly as adeno-carcinoma and is seen in both smokers and nonsmokers. The cysts associated with LC show wall thickening and mural nodularity, which may evolve over time. LC associated with cystic airspaces can be indolent, and long-term surveillance with imaging should be considered if cysts are not resected. <b>CLINICAL IMPACT.</b> Familiarity with the imaging features and temporal evolution of LC associated with cystic airspaces can minimize delays in LC diagnosis. Future management guidelines should include protocols for follow-up and management of cystic lung lesions identified during diagnostic and LC screening CT."

        "abstract": "Early lung cancers associated with cystic airspaces are increasingly being recognized as a cause of delayed diagnoses-owing to data gathered from screening trials and encounters in routine clinical practice as more patients undergo serial imaging. Several morphologic subtypes of cancers associated with cystic airspaces exist and can exhibit variable patterns of progression as the solid elements of the tumor grow. Current understanding of the pathogenesis of these malignancies is limited, and the numbers of cases reported in the literature are small. However, several tumor cell types are represented in these lesions, with adenocarcinoma predominating. The features of cystic airspaces differ among cases and include emphysematous bullae, congenital or fibrotic cysts, subpleural blebs, bronchiectatic airways, and distended distal airspaces. Once identified, these cystic lesions pose management challenges to radiologists in terms of distinguishing them from benign mimics of cancer that are commonly seen in patients who also are at increased risk of lung cancer. Rendering a definitive tissue-based diagnosis can be difficult when the lesions are small, and affected patients tend to be in groups that are at higher risk of requiring biopsy or resection. In addition, the decision to monitor these cases can add to patient anxiety and cause the additional burden of strained departmental resources. The authors have drawn from their experience, emerging evidence from international lung cancer screening trials, and large databases of lung cancer cases from other groups to analyze the prevalence and evolution of lung cancers associated with cystic airspaces and provide guidance for managing these lesions. Although there are insufficient data to support specific management guidelines similar to those for managing small solid and ground-glass lung nodules, these data and guidelines should be the direction for ongoing research on early detection of lung cancer. <sup>&#xa9;</sup>RSNA, 2018."

Lung-RADS v1.1 also classifies solid intermediate-size (6 to &lt; 10 mm) nodules as category 2 if they are perifissural and have a triangular, polygonal, or ovoid shape (indicative of intrapulmonary lymph nodes). Additional category 2 criteria could reduce false-positive results of screening examinations. <b>OBJECTIVE.</b> The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of proposed strategies for reducing false-positive results for intermediate-size nodules on lung cancer screening CT evaluated using Lung-RADS v1.1. <b>METHODS.</b> This retrospective study entailed secondary analysis of National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) data. Of 1387 solid nodules measuring 6.0-9.5 mm on baseline screening CT examinations in the NLST, all 38 nodules in patients who developed cancer and a random sample of 200 nodules in patients who did not develop cancer were selected for further evaluation. Cancers were required to correspond with the baseline nodule on manual review. After exclusions, the sample included 223 patients (median age, 62 years; 143 men, 80 women; 196 benign nodules, 27 malignant nodules). Two thoracic radiologists independently reviewed baseline examinations to record nodule diameter and volume using semiautomated software and to determine whether nodules had perifissural location; other subpleural location; and triangular, polygonal, or ovoid shape. Different schemes for category 2 assignment were compared. <b>RESULTS.</b> Across readers, standard Lung-RADS v1.1 had sensitivity of 89-93% and specificity of 26-31%. A modification assigning nodules less than 10 mm with triangular, polygonal, or ovoid shape in other subpleural locations (vs only perifissural location) as category 2 had sensitivity of 85-93% and specificity of 47-51%. Lung-RADS v1.1 using volume cutoffs had sensitivity of 89-93% and specificity of 37% (both readers). The sensitivity of both modified Lung-RADS v1.1 and Lung-RADS v1.1 with volume cutoffs was not significantly different from standard Lung-RADS v1.1 (all <i>p</i> &gt; .05). However, both schemes' specificity was significantly better than standard Lung-RADS v1.1 (all <i>p</i> &lt; .05). Combining the two strategies yielded sensitivity of 85-93% and specificity of 58-59%. <b>CONCLUSION.</b> Classifying intermediate-size nodules with triangular, polygonal, or ovoid shape in any subpleural (not just perifissural) location as category 2 and using volume- rather than diameter-based measurements improves Lung-RADS specificity without decreased sensitivity. <b>CLINICAL IMPACT.</b> The findings can help reduce false-positive results, decreasing 6-month follow-up examinations for benign findings."

        "abstract": "Background Solid costal pleura-attached noncalcified nodules (CP-NCNs) less than 10.0 mm with lentiform, oval, or semicircular (LOS) or triangular shapes and smooth margins on baseline low-dose CT scans from the Mount Sinai Early Lung and Cardiac Action Program (MS-ELCAP) were reviewed, and it was determined that they can be followed up at the first annual screening rather than having a shorter-term work-up. Purpose To determine whether the same criteria could be used for solid CP-NCNs newly identified at annual screening examinations. Materials and Methods With use of the same MS-ELCAP database, all new solid CP-NCNs measuring 30.0 mm or less were identified at 4425 annual screening examinations between 2010 and 2019. In addition, to ensure that no malignant CP-NCNs met the criteria, all solid malignant CP-NCNs of 30.0 mm or less in the International Early Lung Cancer Action Program, or I-ELCAP, database of 111&#x2009;102 annual screening examinations from the 76 participating institutions between 1992 and 2019 were identified; Mount Sinai is one of these institutions. All identified solid CP-NCNs were reviewed-with the radiologists blinded to diagnosis-for shape (triangular, LOS, polygonal, round, or irregular), margin (smooth or nonsmooth), pleural attachment (broad or narrow), and the presence of emphysema and/or fibrosis within 10.0 mm of each CP-NCN. Intra- and interreader readings were performed, and agreements were determined by using the B-statistic. Results Of the 76 new solid CP-NCNs, 21 were lung cancers. Benign CP-NCNs were smaller than malignant ones (median diameter, 4.2 mm vs 11 mm; <i>P</i> &lt; .001), had a different shape distributions, more frequently had smooth margins (67% vs 14%; <i>P</i> &lt; .001), and less frequently had emphysema (38% vs 81%; <i>P</i> = .003) or fibrosis (3.6% vs 19%; <i>P</i> = .045) within a 10.0 mm radius. All 22 solid CP-NCNs less than 10.0 mm in average diameter with triangular or LOS shapes and smooth margins were benign, and none of the 21 solid malignant CP-NCNs had these characteristics. Intra- and interobserver agreement for triangular or LOS-shaped CP-NCNs with smooth margins was almost perfect (0.77 and 0.69, respectively). Conclusion The same follow-up recommendation developed for baseline costal pleura-attached noncalcified nodules (CP-NCNs) can be used for CP-NCNs newly identified at annual screening rounds. &#xa9; RSNA, 2021."

        "abstract": "<b>BACKGROUND.</b> Incidental findings are frequently encountered during lung cancer screening (LCS). Limited data describe the prevalence of suspected acute infectious and inflammatory lung processes on LCS and how they should be managed. <b>OBJECTIVE.</b> The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence, radiologic reporting and management, and outcome of suspected infectious and inflammatory lung processes identified incidentally during LCS and to propose a management algorithm. <b>METHODS.</b> This retrospective study included 6314 low-dose CT (LDCT) examinations performed between June 2014 and April 2019 in 3800 patients as part of an established LCS program. Radiology reports were reviewed, and patients with potentially infectious or inflammatory lung abnormalities were identified and analyzed for descriptors of imaging findings, Lung-RADS designation, recommendations, and clinical outcomes. Using the descriptors, outcomes, and a greater than 2% threshold risk of malignancy, a follow-up algorithm was developed to decrease additional imaging without affecting cancer detection. <b>RESULTS.</b> A total of 331/3800 (8.7%) patients (178 men, 153 women; mean age [range], 66 [53-87] years) undergoing LCS had lung findings that were attributed to infection or inflammation. These abnormalities were reported as potentially significant findings using the S modifier in 149/331 (45.0%) and as the dominant nodule used to determine the Lung-RADS category in 96/331 (29.0%). Abnormalities were multiple or multifocal in 260/331 (78.5%). Common descriptors were ground-glass (155/331; 46.8%), tree-in-bud (56/331; 16.9%), consolidation (41/331; 12.4%), and clustered (67/331; 20.2%) opacities. A follow-up chest CT outside of screening was performed within 12 months or less in 264/331 (79.8%) and within 6 months or less in 186/331 (56.2%). A total of 260/331 (78.5%) opacities resolved on follow-up imaging. Two malignancies (2/331; 0.6%) were associated with these abnormalities and both had consolidations. Theoretic adoption of a proposed management algorithm for suspected infectious and inflammatory findings reduced unnecessary follow-up imaging by 82.6% without missing a single malignancy. <b>CONCLUSION.</b> Presumed acute infectious or inflammatory lung abnormalities are frequently encountered in the setting of LCS. These opacities are commonly multifocal and resolve on follow-up. Less than 1% are associated with malignancy. <b>CLINICAL IMPACT.</b> Adoption of a conservative management algorithm can standardize recommendations and reduce unnecessary imaging without increasing the risk of missing a malignancy."

Most nodules appear to be secretions, but pathological lesions may show similar findings. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommends repeating LDCT after 1&#x2005;month and proceeding to bronchoscopy if the nodules persist. However, no reports exist about incidentally detected airway nodules. We investigated the significance of airway nodules detected by LDCT screening.We screened patients with incidental airway nodules detected by LDCT in the Seoul National University Hospital group. The characteristics of computed tomography, bronchoscopy, pathology and clinical findings were analysed.Among 53&#x200a;036 individuals who underwent LDCT screening, 313 (0.6%) had airway nodules. Of these, 186 (59.4%) were followed-up with chest computed tomography and/or bronchoscopy. Seven (3.8%) cases had significant lesions, including leiomyoma (n=2), endobronchial tuberculosis (n=2), chronic inflammation (n=1), hamartoma (n=1) and benign granuloma (n=1). The remaining 179 lesions were transient, suggesting that they were secretions.The use of LDCT for lung cancer screening demonstrated the low incidence of airway lesions. Most lesions were transient secretions. True pathological lesions were rare, and no malignant lesion was found. The current recommendation of the NCCN guideline is a reasonable approach that can avoid unnecessary bronchoscopy."

The cancer frequency among such nodules is estimated in the Lung-RADS recommendations and has been investigated primarily by means of retrospectively assigned Lung-RADS classifications. <b>OBJECTIVE.</b> The purpose of this study was to assess the frequency of cancer among lung nodules assigned Lung-RADS category 3 or 4 at lung cancer screening (LCS) in clinical practice and to evaluate factors that affect the cancer frequency within each category. <b>METHODS.</b> This retrospective study was based on review of clinical radiology reports of 9148 consecutive low-dose CT LCS examinations performed for 4798 patients between June 2014 and January 2021 as part of an established LCS program. Unique nodules assigned Lung-RADS category 3 or 4 (4A, 4B, or 4X) that were clinically categorized as benign or malignant in a multidisciplinary conference that considered histologic analysis and follow-up imaging were selected for further analysis. Benign diagnoses based on stability required at least 12 months of follow-up imaging. Indeterminate nodules were excluded. Cancer frequencies were evaluated. <b>RESULTS.</b> Of the 9148 LCS examinations, 857 (9.4%) were assigned Lung-RADS category 3, and 721 (7.9%) were assigned category 4. The final analysis included 1297 unique nodules in 1139 patients (598 men, 541 women; mean age, 66.0 &#xb1; 6.3 years). A total of 1108 of 1297 (85.4%) nodules were deemed benign, and 189 of 1297 (14.6%) were deemed malignant. The frequencies of malignancy of category 3, 4A, 4B, and 4X nodules were 3.9%, 15.5%, 36.3%, and 76.8%. A total of 45 of 46 (97.8%) endobronchial nodules (all category 4A) were deemed benign on the basis of resolution. Cancer frequency was 13.1% for solid, 24.4% for part-solid, and 13.5% for ground-glass nodules. <b>CONCLUSION.</b> In the application of Lung-RADS to LCS clinical practice, the frequency of Lung-RADS category 3 and 4 nodules and the cancer frequency in these categories were higher than the prevalence and cancer risk estimated for category 3 and 4 nodules in the Lung-RADS recommendations and those reported in earlier studies in which category assignments were retrospective. Nearly all endobronchial category 4A nodules were benign. <b>CLINICAL IMPACT.</b> Future Lung-RADS iterations should consider the findings of this study from real-world practice to improve the clinical utility of the system."

        "abstract": "Several medical associations recommended lung cancer screening by low-dose computed tomography scanning for high-risk groups. Counselling of the candidates on the potential harms and benefits and their lung cancer risk is a prerequisite for screening. In the NELSON trial, screenings are considered positive for (part) solid lung nodules with a volume &gt;500 mm3 and for (part) solid or nonsolid nodules with a volume-doubling time &lt;400 days. For this study, the performance of the NELSON strategy in three screening rounds was evaluated and risk calculations were made for a follow-up period of 5.5 years. 458 (6%) of the 7582 participants screened had a positive screen result and 200 (2.6%) were diagnosed with lung cancer. The positive screenings had a predictive value of 40.6% and only 1.2% of all scan results were false-positive. In a period of 5.5 years, the risk of screen-detected lung cancer strongly depends on the result of the first scan: 1.0% after a negative baseline result, 5.7% after an indeterminate baseline and 48.3% after a positive baseline. The screening strategy yielded few positive and false-positive scans with a reasonable positive predictive value. The 5.5-year lung cancer risk calculations aid clinicians in counselling candidates for lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography."

Using mean or maximum axial diameter to assess nodule volume led to a substantial mean overestimation of nodule volume of 47.2% and 85.1%, respectively, compared to semi-automated volume.

        "abstract": "Currently, lung cancer screening by low-dose chest CT is implemented in the United States for high-risk persons. A disadvantage of lung cancer screening is the large number of small-to-intermediate sized lung nodules, detected in around 50% of all participants, the large majority being benign. Accurate estimation of nodule size and growth is essential in the classification of lung nodules. Currently, manual diameter measurements are the standard for lung cancer screening programs and routine clinical care. However, European screening studies using semi-automated volume measurements have shown higher accuracy and reproducibility compared to diameter measurements. In addition to this, with the optimization of CT scan techniques and reconstruction parameters, as well as advances in segmentation software, the accuracy of nodule volume measurement can be improved even further. The positive results of previous studies on volume and diameter measurements of lung nodules suggest that manual measurements of nodule diameter may be replaced by semi-automated volume measurements in the (near) future."

Diameter-based Lung-RADS and volume-based NELSON (Nederlands-Leuvens Longkanker Screenings ONderzoek trial) categories have shown variable performance in nodule risk assessment. <b>OBJECTIVE.</b> The purpose of this study was to assess Lung-RADS and NELSON classifications of nodules detected on follow-up lung cancer screening CT examinations. <b>METHODS.</b> This retrospective study included 185 patients (100 women and 85 men; median age, 66 years) who underwent a lung cancer screening CT examination for which a prior CT examination was available. Stratified random sampling was performed to enrich the sample with suspicious nodules, yielding 50, 45, 47, 30, and 13 nodules with Lung-RADS categories 2, 3, 4A, 4B, and 4X, respectively. Lung-RADS categories were recorded from clinical reports. The linear measurements of the nodules were extracted from clinical reports to generate Lung-RADS categories by use of strict criteria from Lung-RADS version 1.1. Two radiologists used a semiautomated tool to obtain nodule volumes, which were used to generate NELSON categories. Lung cancer risk was assessed. ROC analysis was performed. Percentages and AUCs were weighted on the basis of Lung-RADS category frequencies in the underlying screening cohort. <b>RESULTS.</b> Twenty-nine cancers were diagnosed. The weighted cancer risk was 5% for new nodules, 1% for stable existing nodules, and 44% for growing existing nodules. None of the clinical Lung-RADS category 2 nodules were cancer. With use of strict Lung-RADS version 1.1 criteria, 34 nodules, including seven cancers, were downgraded to category 2. The AUC for cancer was 0.96 for clinical Lung-RADS, 0.81 for strict Lung-RADS, 0.71-0.84 for the NELSON algorithm (two readers), and 0.89 for nodule diameter measurement. Clinical Lung-RADS achieved weighted sensitivity and specificity, respectively, of 100% and 85% for the entire sample, 100% and 41% for new nodules, and 100% and 94% for existing nodules. The optimal diameter threshold was 8 mm for existing nodules versus 6 mm for new nodules. <b>CONCLUSION.</b> Lung-RADS, as applied by radiologists in clinical practice, achieved excellent performance on follow-up screening examinations. Strict Lung-RADS resulted in the downgrading of some cancers to category 2. Volumetric assessments had weaker performance than clinical Lung-RADS. New nodules warrant smaller size thresholds than existing nodules. <b>CLINICAL IMPACT.</b> The findings of the present study provide insight into radiologists' management of nodules detected on follow-up screening examinations."

In this paper, the screening regimen and the classification and management of the screen-detected nodules at baseline and incidence screening is presented. This is the first large lung cancer screening trial in which the nodule management protocol is based on volumetric nodule assessment and the presence or absence of growth. Furthermore, the quality assurance measures and the NELSON management system (NMS) are presented."

        "abstract": "We learned many unanticipated and valuable lessons since we started planning our study of low-dose computed tomography (CT) screening for lung cancer in 1991. The publication of the baseline results of the Early Lung Cancer Action Project (ELCAP) in Lancet 1999 showed that CT screening could identify a high proportion of early, curable lung cancers. This stimulated large national screening studies to be quickly started. The ELCAP design, which provided evidence about screening in the context of a clinical program, was able to rapidly expand to a 12-institution study in New York State (NY-ELCAP) and to many international institutions (International-ELCAP), ultimately working with 82 institutions, all using the common I-ELCAP protocol. This expansion was possible because the investigators had developed the ELCAP Management System for screening, capturing data and CT images, and providing for quality assurance. This advanced registry and its rapid accumulation of data and images allowed continual assessment and updating of the regimen of screening as advances in knowledge and new technology emerged. For example, in the initial ELCAP study, introduction of helical CT scanners had allowed imaging of the entire lungs in a single breath, but the images were obtained in 10&#x2009;mm increments resulting in about 30 images per person. Today, images are obtained in submillimeter slice thickness, resulting in around 700 images per person, which are viewed on high-resolution monitors. The regimen provides the imaging acquisition parameters, imaging interpretation, definition of positive result, and the recommendations for further workup, which now include identification of emphysema and coronary artery calcifications. Continual updating is critical to maximize the benefit of screening and to minimize potential harms. Insights were gained about the natural history of lung cancers, identification and management of nodule subtypes, increased understanding of nodule imaging and pathologic features, and measurement variability inherent in CT scanners. The registry also provides the foundation for assessment of new statistical techniques, including artificial intelligence, and integration of effective genomic and blood-based biomarkers, as they are developed."

Standardization of reporting of positive findings identified on screening low-dose CT (LDCT) scans, specifically lung nodules, is a key element of high-quality lung cancer screening. The American College of Radiology developed the Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) system for this purpose. In addition to detailed categorization of lung nodules, Lung-RADS identifies category S for other incidental findings identified on screening LDCT scans. In contrast to the highly structured reporting for nodules, category S findings are reported at the discretion of individual readers, with the potential for high variability of reporting. Incidental findings on lung cancer screening studies are common, may trigger unwarranted evaluation with potential harm and cost, and may precipitate patient distress. In response to these concerns, our multidisciplinary lung cancer screening program developed a structured system for standardized reporting of category S findings based on recommendations of the American College of Radiology and relevant specialty societies."

          "riginal intent was for annual LCS to be performed 12 months from the date of the baseline examination, as the NLST validated this protocol in reducing lung cancer mortality with LCS CT [1]. With this approach, a baseline Lung-RADS 3 nodule stable at 6-month followup is reclassi /uniFB01 ed to category 2 with a return to annual screening in 6 months from the current examination (12 months from the baseline study). In practice, targeting follow-up recommendations from the baseline or annual screening examination can be problematic. Patients may not always comply with follow-up recommendations, and some were being imaged at later time points, such as 9 months from baseline. In such a case, a patient reclassi /uniFB01 ed as LungRADS 2 would be expected to return in 3 months for annual LCS. Similar dif /uniFB01 culties were encountered in managing category 4A (suspicious) nodules stable at 3-month follow-up CT. Such nodules were reclassi /uniFB01 ed as category 2, and patients would not return to imaging for 9 months -a longer follow-up interval than that recommended for stable probably benign category 3 nodules (return to imaging at 6 months), which was paradoxical.",

At least two studies have been performed evaluating the Lung-RADS management follow-up intervals for 4A nodules /uniFB01 nding the initial 3-month recommendation is optimal, but downgrading stable 4A nodules to Lung-RADS 2 is potentially problematic, as previously discussed [14,57].

Likewise, category 4B lesions that are proven benign after diagnostic evaluation can be reclassi /uniFB01 ed as category 1 or 2 depending on the presence of other stable nodules. As LCS and followup examinations are classi /uniFB01 ed in Lung-RADS according to the most concerning /uniFB01 nding, new or growing nodules supersede this approach.

          "riginal intent was for annual LCS to be performed 12 months from the date of the baseline examination, as the NLST validated this protocol in reducing lung cancer mortality with LCS CT [1]. With this approach, a baseline Lung-RADS 3 nodule stable at 6-month followup is reclassi /uniFB01 ed to category 2 with a return to annual screening in 6 months from the current examination (12 months from the baseline study). In practice, targeting follow-up recommendations from the baseline or annual screening examination can be problematic. Patients may not always comply with follow-up recommendations, and some were being imaged at later time points, such as 9 months from baseline. In such a case, a patient reclassi /uniFB01 ed as LungRADS 2 would be expected to return in 3 months for annual LCS. Similar dif /uniFB01 culties were encountered in managing category 4A (suspicious) nodules stable at 3-month follow-up CT. Such nodules were reclassi /uniFB01 ed as category 2, and patients would not return to imaging for 9 months -a longer follow-up interval than that recommended for stable probably benign category 3 nodules (return to imaging at 6 months), which was paradoxical.",

At least two studies have been performed evaluating the Lung-RADS management follow-up intervals for 4A nodules /uniFB01 nding the initial 3-month recommendation is optimal, but downgrading stable 4A nodules to Lung-RADS 2 is potentially problematic, as previously discussed [14,57].

Likewise, category 4B lesions that are proven benign after diagnostic evaluation can be reclassi /uniFB01 ed as category 1 or 2 depending on the presence of other stable nodules. As LCS and followup examinations are classi /uniFB01 ed in Lung-RADS according to the most concerning /uniFB01 nding, new or growing nodules supersede this approach.

          "riginal intent was for annual LCS to be performed 12 months from the date of the baseline examination, as the NLST validated this protocol in reducing lung cancer mortality with LCS CT [1]. With this approach, a baseline Lung-RADS 3 nodule stable at 6-month followup is reclassi /uniFB01 ed to category 2 with a return to annual screening in 6 months from the current examination (12 months from the baseline study). In practice, targeting follow-up recommendations from the baseline or annual screening examination can be problematic. Patients may not always comply with follow-up recommendations, and some were being imaged at later time points, such as 9 months from baseline. In such a case, a patient reclassi /uniFB01 ed as LungRADS 2 would be expected to return in 3 months for annual LCS. Similar dif /uniFB01 culties were encountered in managing category 4A (suspicious) nodules stable at 3-month follow-up CT. Such nodules were reclassi /uniFB01 ed as category 2, and patients would not return to imaging for 9 months -a longer follow-up interval than that recommended for stable probably benign category 3 nodules (return to imaging at 6 months), which was paradoxical.",

At least two studies have been performed evaluating the Lung-RADS management follow-up intervals for 4A nodules /uniFB01 nding the initial 3-month recommendation is optimal, but downgrading stable 4A nodules to Lung-RADS 2 is potentially problematic, as previously discussed [14,57].

Likewise, category 4B lesions that are proven benign after diagnostic evaluation can be reclassi /uniFB01 ed as category 1 or 2 depending on the presence of other stable nodules. As LCS and followup examinations are classi /uniFB01 ed in Lung-RADS according to the most concerning /uniFB01 nding, new or growing nodules supersede this approach.

Such /uniFB01 ndings may be classi /uniFB01 ed as Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) 0 based on clinical suspicion of an infectious or in /uniFB02 ammatory process with a recommendation for follow-up low-dose CT (LDCT) in 1 to 3 months to ensure resolution.

(B) A 55-year-old patient had a baseline LCS CT classi /uniFB01 ed as Lung-RADS 3 (not shown) and presents for 6month follow-up LDCT. There is a new lobular 28-mm mean diameter soft tissue nodule in the left lower lobe (B1, arrow). Given the size and lack of an abnormality in this area on the prior examination, the study was classi /uniFB01 ed as Lung-RADS 0 for a likely infectious process. The patient returned for follow-up LDCT at 3 months, which showed a marked decrease in size but not complete resolution (B2, arrow). No new /uniFB01 ndings were identi /uniFB01 ed, and other nodules were stable. The examination was reclassi /uniFB01 ed as Lung-RADS 2 with a management recommendation of a 12-month LCS CT from the date of the current study. Had the nodule remained stable, increased, or only slightly decreased in size, an infectious or in /uniFB02 ammatory process would be less likely; the examination would be reclassi /uniFB01 ed as Lung-RADS 4B based on size and composition with a recommendation for diagnostic evaluation. (C) A 61-year-old patient presenting for annual LCS CT is found to have multiple new tree-in-bud nodules bilaterally with a basilar predominance (C2) relative to the prior annual LCS examination (C1). Although an infectious process is most likely, a Lung-RADS 0 classi /uniFB01 cation with 1- to 3-month follow-up LDCT is unnecessary.

The study is then reclassi /uniFB01 ed at follow-up according to the most concerning /uniFB01 nding. (B) A 55-year-old patient had a baseline LCS CT classi /uniFB01 ed as Lung-RADS 3 (not shown) and presents for 6month follow-up LDCT. There is a new lobular 28-mm mean diameter soft tissue nodule in the left lower lobe (B1, arrow). Given the size and lack of an abnormality in this area on the prior examination, the study was classi /uniFB01 ed as Lung-RADS 0 for a likely infectious process. The patient returned for follow-up LDCT at 3 months, which showed a marked decrease in size but not complete resolution (B2, arrow). No new /uniFB01 ndings were identi /uniFB01 ed, and other nodules were stable. The examination was reclassi /uniFB01 ed as Lung-RADS 2 with a management recommendation of a 12-month LCS CT from the date of the current study. Had the nodule remained stable, increased, or only slightly decreased in size, an infectious or in /uniFB02 ammatory process would be less likely; the examination would be reclassi /uniFB01 ed as Lung-RADS 4B based on size and composition with a recommendation for diagnostic evaluation. (C) A 61-year-old patient presenting for annual LCS CT is found to have multiple new tree-in-bud nodules bilaterally with a basilar predominance (C2) relative to the prior annual LCS examination (C1). Although an infectious process is most likely, a Lung-RADS 0 classi /uniFB01 cation with 1- to 3-month follow-up LDCT is unnecessary. In this case, the examination may be classi /uniFB01 ed based on the size and composition of the new nodules (solid, < 4 mm), corresponding to Lung-RADS 2."

Such /uniFB01 ndings may be classi /uniFB01 ed as Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) 0 based on clinical suspicion of an infectious or in /uniFB02 ammatory process with a recommendation for follow-up low-dose CT (LDCT) in 1 to 3 months to ensure resolution. The study is then reclassi /uniFB01 ed at follow-up according to the most concerning /uniFB01 nding. (B) A 55-year-old patient had a baseline LCS CT classi /uniFB01 ed as Lung-RADS 3 (not shown) and presents for 6month follow-up LDCT. There is a new lobular 28-mm mean diameter soft tissue nodule in the left lower lobe (B1, arrow). Given the size and lack of an abnormality in this area on the prior examination, the study was classi /uniFB01 ed as Lung-RADS 0 for a likely infectious process. The patient returned for follow-up LDCT at 3 months, which showed a marked decrease in size but not complete resolution (B2, arrow). No new /uniFB01 ndings were identi /uniFB01 ed, and other nodules were stable. The examination was reclassi /uniFB01 ed as Lung-RADS 2 with a management recommendation of a 12-month LCS CT from the date of the current study. Had the nodule remained stable, increased, or only slightly decreased in size, an infectious or in /uniFB02 ammatory process would be less likely; the examination would be reclassi /uniFB01 ed as Lung-RADS 4B based on size and composition with a recommendation for diagnostic evaluation. (C) A 61-year-old patient presenting for annual LCS CT is found to have multiple new tree-in-bud nodules bilaterally with a basilar predominance (C2) relative to the prior annual LCS examination (C1). Although an infectious process is most likely, a Lung-RADS 0 classi /uniFB01 cation with 1- to 3-month follow-up LDCT is unnecessary.

Such /uniFB01 ndings may be classi /uniFB01 ed as Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) 0 based on clinical suspicion of an infectious or in /uniFB02 ammatory process with a recommendation for follow-up low-dose CT (LDCT) in 1 to 3 months to ensure resolution.

(B) A 55-year-old patient had a baseline LCS CT classi /uniFB01 ed as Lung-RADS 3 (not shown) and presents for 6month follow-up LDCT. There is a new lobular 28-mm mean diameter soft tissue nodule in the left lower lobe (B1, arrow). Given the size and lack of an abnormality in this area on the prior examination, the study was classi /uniFB01 ed as Lung-RADS 0 for a likely infectious process. The patient returned for follow-up LDCT at 3 months, which showed a marked decrease in size but not complete resolution (B2, arrow). No new /uniFB01 ndings were identi /uniFB01 ed, and other nodules were stable. The examination was reclassi /uniFB01 ed as Lung-RADS 2 with a management recommendation of a 12-month LCS CT from the date of the current study. Had the nodule remained stable, increased, or only slightly decreased in size, an infectious or in /uniFB02 ammatory process would be less likely; the examination would be reclassi /uniFB01 ed as Lung-RADS 4B based on size and composition with a recommendation for diagnostic evaluation. (C) A 61-year-old patient presenting for annual LCS CT is found to have multiple new tree-in-bud nodules bilaterally with a basilar predominance (C2) relative to the prior annual LCS examination (C1). Although an infectious process is most likely, a Lung-RADS 0 classi /uniFB01 cation with 1- to 3-month follow-up LDCT is unnecessary. In this case, the examination may be classi /uniFB01 ed based on the size and composition of the new nodules (solid, < 4 mm), corresponding to Lung-RADS 2."

In practice, targeting follow-up recommendations from the baseline or annual screening examination can be problematic. Patients may not always comply with follow-up recommendations, and some were being imaged at later time points, such as 9 months from baseline. In such a case, a patient reclassi /uniFB01 ed as LungRADS 2 would be expected to return in 3 months for annual LCS. Similar dif /uniFB01 culties were encountered in managing category 4A (suspicious) nodules stable at 3-month follow-up CT. Such nodules were reclassi /uniFB01 ed as category 2, and patients would not return to imaging for 9 months -a longer follow-up interval than that recommended for stable probably benign category 3 nodules (return to imaging at 6 months), which was paradoxical.",
