            "text": "Advanced Diagnostic Bronchoscopy is a relatively new term that describes several new bronchoscopic techniques. Over the last decade advancements in the optical capabilities of the flexible bronchoscope and adjunctive catheterbased imaging tools have created new windows into the lung. Autofluorescence, Narrow-Band imaging (NBI), probe-based confocal light endomicroscopy (pCLE) are in various levels of clinical utility and investigation. Endobronchial Ultrasound (Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)) is now replacing mediastinoscopy and combined with conventional or navigational bronchoscopy is now the preferred route for diagnosis and staging lung cancer [1-3]. Navigational Bronchoscopy is a group of similar technologies that incorporate additional image guidance. These can be in the form of virtual bronchoscopy, real-time CT guidance, and adjunctive peripheral endobronchial ultrasound. Electromagnetic guidance is combined with specific catheters and probes to reach peripheral lung lesions. While many studies regarding these technologies have used what is described as ''moderate sedation'', the evolving practice of multimodality bronchoscopy favors the use of general anesthesia [4,5]. This is because these techniques often require a longer duration than simple diagnostic bronchoscopy, precise positioning, and often a large diameter bronchoscope with complex instrumentation. We describe some of these advanced diagnostic procedures in more detail along with their anesthetic considerations and management."

Central airway obstruction can result from relatively benign conditions like Wegner's granulomatosis (now known as granulomatosis with polyangiitis), a complication of tracheostomy or tracheal intubation related trauma, or as a result of a malignant process. However, the principles of management are somewhat similar; thus for the sake of simplicity we will focus on discussing malignant central airway obstruction to demonstrate principles of therapeutic interventional bronchoscopy and the anesthetic management."

The original description of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) involved catheter-based ultrasonography with a balloon used for assessing anatomic structures surrounding central airways. This device was also adopted for assessing airway wall structures for mucosal invasion of malignancy. Since then, a linear convex probe ultrasonography bronchoscope was developed specifically for transbronchial needle aspiration of mediastinal adenopathy. At present, the most common use of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) is sampling mediastinal masses, specifically in staging non-small cell lung cancer [2]. There is also now peripheral lung sampling using catheter-based ultrasonography for localizing peripheral lung lesions. Each of these techniques has been performed using either moderate sedation or general anesthesia and each requires a specific set of equipment and expertise, and has related risks to the patients."

This technique involves placing a balloon catheter with an embedded ultrasonography probe over suspicious areas and images are recorded. In general, this technique requires that clinicians only have to achieve tissue contact as shown in Fig. 1 but care must be maintained to avoid airway occlusion. Peripheral radial Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) has been used to help localize, and in some cases detect, malignancy. There are several different probes made for this purpose and most of them are directed via guide sheath or some other catheter-based system. For radial Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), risks are associated with the biopsy and are not specifically associated with the imaging technique. The most common risk is pneumothorax, which theoretically may be accentuated with use of positive pressure ventilation; however, this has not definitely been proven [14]. Linear convex probe Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) is a very specific procedure requiring a dedicated bronchoscope. The Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscope is slightly larger than the standard therapeutic bronchoscope. The distal tip has a 6.9-mm outer diameter, a 30 /C14 angle of vision, and slightly limited range of motion. Significant skills are required to perform this procedure beyond those required for standard conventional bronchoscopy [15]. There are 2 separate",

In known or suspected non-small cell lung cancer each of these nodal stations are sampled with multiple needle passes [1,2]. Procedure duration can be 120 minutes or longer depending on the complexity and number of nodal stations that require biopsy. This procedure is traditionally performed either via a large endotracheal tube (ideally 8.5 mm ID or larger) or via a supraglottic airway (SGA) under general anesthesia. It has also been described as being performed transorally with moderate sedation. This procedure is rapidly replacing mediastinoscopy as the primary modality of diagnosing and staging advanced-stage lung cancer. Overall this is a safe procedure in which the risks are mainly the same as those associated with other biopsy techniques or damage to the instruments [14,16]."

The flexible bronchoscope is used as a conduit to direct the catheter-based probe, which interacts with the electromagnetic field and generates real-time, directional information to the operator to direct the catheter toward a target [17,18]. This information allows additional confirmation with techniques like fluoroscopy or radial probe Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) to facilitate transbronchial lung tissue acquisition. There are also established techniques for placing fiducial implants, directing high-dose radiation brachytherapy catheters, and placing dye marking on the pleural surface for assisting in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)."

In contrast, if the tumor is obstructing the airway because of mass effect and there is no endoluminal component, it is called extrinsic compression (extraluminal). Most central airway obstructions are in the final mixed category, in which there are elements of both intrinsic and extrinsic involvement. The tumor often originates adjacent to the airway and erodes through the airway wall, invading the lumen. This classification system provides the best therapeutic approach that can be used [23]."

Direct visualization identifies the location of the lesion, the extent of airway involvement, and the vascularity and fragility of the lesion. However, bronchoscopy in these patients has risks. There is potential for patients to develop complete airway obstruction caused by the presence of the bronchoscope in a critically narrowed central airway. In addition, local bleeding and mucosal trauma during bronchoscopy may further compromise the airway lumen. Therefore, it is essential that the procedure is performed with the utmost care.

In most instances, a combination of several interventional procedures is needed for best results."

Special attention is needed during airway evaluation, symptoms of compromise, and review of the pulmonologist's evaluation regarding the size of the lesion or tumor and its location within the bronchial tree and the degree of impact on ventilation, as discussed earlier for central airway obstruction. The incidence of the so-called difficult airway, which is a term used to identify difficulty to mask ventilate, intubate the trachea, difficulty with ventilation using a supraglottic airway, and/or difficulty with surgical airway [30], may not be any higher than the general surgical population. However, lower airway-related difficulties can be encountered, such as airway bleeding, obstruction, and loss of airway integrity from lesions such as fistulas. However, because of an aging population and advances in treatment, the authors have encountered many patients who survived their head and neck cancers after undergoing a resection, a flap reconstruction, and/or neck radiation. These patients lived long enough to develop lung cancer and related lower airway stenosis/obstruction, and thus had upper and lower airway challenges and required some modifications and custom management that are beyond the scope of this article. Note that judicious use of premedication sedatives and anxiolytics is advised in this patient population because many of them have limited respiratory reserve [31]."

When general anesthesia is used, a total intravenous anesthetic technique (TIVA), usually an infusion of propofol, is preferred rather than an inhalational anesthetic technique. Compared with an inhalational anesthetic technique, TIVA ensures continuous delivery of the anesthetic and prevents the pollution of the operating room by inhalational anesthetic that can be caused by circuit leaks because of the nature of the procedure [26]. Sarkiss and colleagues [32], also reported observing more bleeding at the needle biopsy site when inhalation anesthetics were used compared with the TIVA technique, presumably because of the vascular dilatory effects of inhalational anesthetics. Inhalational anesthetics may have some advantages in certain situations. We previously described our anesthetic technique [33] for the management of mediastinal mass, when inhalational anesthetics were used to augment the amnestic properties of dexmedetomidine while still maintaining spontaneous ventilation. The potent bronchodilating effect of inhalational anesthetics can be helpful in overcoming the severe bronchospasm often encountered in the third session of thermoplasty for endobronchial treatment of severe asthma, as discussed earlier [5]."

They facilitate ETT insertion and/or SGA placement and improve overall lung compliance by eliminating the chest wall component and thus making positive pressure ventilation easier and more effective. Moreover, when an SGA is used (vs ETT) paralyzed vocal cords in an abducted position are potentially exposed to less trauma caused by the large-diameter operating bronchoscope. In addition, they provide a motionless patient, which is advantageous because unexpected patient movement can have serious consequences [35]. An example of such a situation is when trying to sample a node that is very close to the great vessels adjacent to hilar area. Irritation of the tracheobronchial tree during needle insertion for biopsy in a nonparalyzed patient may result in patient movement, which may lead to missing the target, especially if it is a small node, requiring the process to be repeated, multiplied by the number of attempts at each location, which can considerably prolong the procedure time. However, avoiding muscle relaxation and maintaining spontaneous ventilation may have some advantages in managing patients with very large mediastinal masses [33], as well as in avoiding positive pressure ventilation in cases associated with loss of airway integrity; for example, tracheoesophageal fistula, and post-lung transplant main stem dehiscence."

        "abstract": "Various techniques, including standard bronchoscopy, transthoracic needle aspiration and mediastinoscopy, are used for diagnosis and staging of lung cancer. Minimizing the number of invasive procedures for lung cancer diagnosis and staging is preferred, however, and a growing number of bronchoscopic techniques are being used. Currently available techniques for the initial diagnosis of lung cancer include electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy with computed tomography mapping and sample collection, endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) using radial or convex probe tips, and the combination of the two approaches. EBUS with transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is highly specific and sensitive for the examination of mediastinal lymph nodes. Several studies have demonstrated the utility of this approach for less invasive lung cancer mediastinal staging. EBUS-TBNA has also been used in the collection of tissue samples for the analysis of tumor biomarkers that significantly influence the selection of cancer treatment strategies. Evidence suggests that EBUS-TBNA may be less useful for restaging patients with lung cancer after cytotoxic therapy."

        "abstract": "Real-time endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is an established technique for invasive mediastinal staging of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Needle-based techniques are now recommended as a first-line diagnostic modality for mediastinal staging. Accurate performance of systematic staging with EBUS-TBNA requires a detailed knowledge of mediastinal anatomy. This examination begins at the N3 lymph nodes, progressing through the N2 and N1 lymph node stations, unless a higher station lymph node is positive for malignant cells by rapid on-site cytologic examination. Objective methods of identifying EBUS-TBNA targets include sampling any lymph node station with a visible lymph node or with a lymph node greater than 5 mm in short axis. Three passes per station or the use of rapid on-site cytologic examination with identification of diagnostic material (tumor or lymphocytes) up to five passes are well-established techniques. Obtaining sufficient tissue for molecular profiling may require performing more than three passes. The operating characteristics of EBUS-TBNA are similar to mediastinoscopy. However, mediastinoscopy should be considered in the setting of a negative EBUS-TBNA and a high posterior probability of N2 or N3 involvement."

These factors and an airway shared with the pulmonologist present a clear challenge to anesthesiologists. The key to success lies in the understanding of both the underlying pathology and procedure being performed combined with frequent two-way communication between the anesthesiologist and the pulmonologist. Above all, vigilance and preparedness are paramount. Topics discussed in this review include anesthesia for advanced diagnostic procedures as well as for interventional/ therapeutic procedures. The latter includes bronchoscopic tracheal balloon dilation, tracheobronchial stenting, endobronchial electrocautery, bronchoscopic cryotherapy and other techniques. Special situations, such as tracheoesophageal fistula and mediastinal masses, are also considered."

        "abstract": "The role of advanced brochoscopic diagnostic techniques in detection and staging of lung cancer has steeply increased in recent years. Bronchoscopic imaging techniques became widely available and easy to use. Technical improvement led to merging in technologies making autofluorescence or narrow band imaging incorporated into one bronchoscope. New tools, such as autofluorescence imagining (AFI), narrow band imaging (NBI) or fuji intelligent chromo endoscopy (FICE), found their place in respiratory endoscopy suites. Development of endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) improved minimally invasive mediastinal staging and diagnosis of peripheral lung lesions. Linear EBUS proven to be complementary to mediastinoscopy. This technique is now available in almost all high volume centers performing bronchoscopy. Radial EBUS with mini-probes and guiding sheaths provides accurate diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary lesions. Combining EBUS guided procedures with rapid on site cytology (ROSE) increases diagnostic yield even more. Electromagnetic navigation technology (EMN) is also widely used for diagnosis of peripheral lesions. Future development will certainly lead to new improvements in technology and creation of new sophisticated tools for research in respiratory endoscopy. Broncho-microscopy, alveoloscopy, optical coherence tomography are some of the new research techniques emerging for rapid technological development."

The primary aim of this study was to evaluate relation between vascular patterns visualized by NBI and histology of lung cancer. We prospectively evaluated 65 patients with suspected lung cancer scheduled for bronchoscopy. NBI followed conventional WL videobronchoscopy. After identification of endoscopically visible tumor, NBI was used to determine predominant type of pathological vascular pattern (dotted, tortuous, abrupt-ending blood vessels-Shibuya descriptors). All the lesions were biopsied and histologically confirmed. There were 81.5 % male and 18.5 % female patients evaluated in the study. Lung cancer was confirmed in all patients; 63.1 % were diagnosed with squamous cell lung cancer (SCC), 24.6 % had adenocarcinoma, 9.2 % had small-cell (SCLC) and 3.1 % large-cell lung cancer (LC). Dotted blood vessels were significantly (p &lt; 0.000) associated with adenocarcinoma, identified in 68.4 % adenocarcinoma and 31.6 % SCC. Tortuous blood vessels were identified in 72 % SCC, 8 % adenocarcinoma, 12 % SCLC and 8 % of LC. Tortuous blood vessels were significantly (p &lt; 0.000) associated with SCC. Abrupt-ending vessels were identified in 81 % SCC, 14.3 % SCLC and 4.8 % adenocarcinoma and were significantly associated (p &lt; 0.000) with SCC. Dotted visual pattern of blood vessels identified during NBI videobronchoscopy is highly suggesting adenocarcinoma histology of lung cancer. Tortuous and abrupt-ending blood vessels visualized under NBI videobronchoscopy significantly suggest squamous cell histology of lung cancer. Large-scale studies should be designed in order to determine true relation between visual appearance and histology in lung cancer."

        "abstract": "Although the treatment of choice for stage I lung cancer patients is surgery, a lot of patients have a high comorbidity and are medically inoperable. Bronchoscopy, as a central technique in diagnosing lung cancer, has the potency to apply endoscopic therapy to small lung lesions in a minimally invasive way in patients with high risk for surgery. Unfortunately, bronchoscopy cannot always reach lesions in the peripheral lung, in particular the smaller lesions. Therefore, new guidance techniques like virtual bronchoscopy and electromagnetic navigation are now available and instead of using the systems as a diagnostic tool, these techniques may provide an option for therapeutic interventions to inoperable lung tumor patients. With endoscopic fiducial marker placement for robotic radiosurgery and endoluminal high-dose brachytherapy, local radiotherapy of peripheral lung tumors becomes feasible, reducing radiotherapy-induced toxicity. Radiofrequency tissue ablation through the working channel of a flexible bronchoscope may be a chance of making a diagnosis and a curative treatment in one endoscopic session. However, technical improvements of the ablation probes are currently necessary to expand the sizes of ablated areas. Even though the technologies are very attractive and pilot data are extremely encouraging, more studies establishing selection criteria and best utility are needed."

The incidence of this disorder appears to be rising because of the epidemic of lung cancer; however, benign causes of central airway obstruction are being seen more frequently as well. The morbidity is significant and if left untreated, death from suffocation is a frequent outcome. Management of these patients is difficult, but therapeutic and diagnostic tools are now available that are beneficial to most patients and almost all airway obstruction can be relieved expeditiously. This review examines current approaches in the workup and treatment of patients suffering from airway impairment. Although large, randomized, comparative studies are not available, data show significant improvement in patient outcomes and quality of life with treatment of central airway obstruction. Clearly, more studies assessing the relative utility of specific airway interventions and their impact on morbidity and mortality are needed. Currently, the most comprehensive approach can be offered at centers with expertise in the management of complex airway disorders and availability of all endoscopic and surgical options."

Palliation of malignant tracheobronchial obstruction by LPR, stents, brachytherapy, PDT, or a combination thereof results in relief of dyspnea, hemoptysis, and postobstructive pneumonia. Importantly, it avoids intubation in patients with respiratory distress and facilitates the weaning of patients from MV. In the exciting field of lung cancer screening and treatment of early lung cancer, PDT, brachytherapy, EC, and LPR may represent treatment alternatives to surgical resection, especially in a select group of patients with high surgical risk or favorable endobronchial lesions. Clinicians await the results of future studies, which will (1) better define the impact of each treatment modality on patient care in terms of cost, survival, and improvement in quality of life, and (2) determine the optimal combination therapy relative to bronchoscopic and conventional treatment for effective palliation and cure of lung cancer."

When complications occur, it may be necessary to remove the device. Removal of a SEMS is usually performed during general anesthesia with muscle relaxation and positive pressure ventilation, often using total intravenous anesthesia. Airway management depends on stent type and location. Intubating patients' tracheas with a tracheal stent requires special caution, as it risks damaging tissue and dislodging the stent distally. Potential complications with removal include tracheal disruption, retained stent pieces, mucosal tears, re-obstruction requiring new stent placement, the need for postoperative ventilation, pneumothorax, damage to the pulmonary artery, and death."

We describe the successful anesthetic management of two patients with AMM in which dexmedetomidine was used at supra-sedative doses. Our first case was a 41-year-old man who presented with a 10 x 9 x 11 cm AMM, a pericardial effusion, compression of the right atrium, and superior vena cava syndrome. He had severe obstruction of the right mainstem bronchus, distal trachea with tumor compression, and endobronchial tumor invasion. Our second case was a 62-year-old man with tracheal and bronchial obstruction secondary to a recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer mediastinal mass. Both patients were scheduled for laser tumor debulking and treatment of the tracheal compression with a Y-stent placed through a rigid bronchoscope. Both patients were fiberoptically intubated awake under sedation using a dexmedetomidine infusion, followed by general anesthesia (mainly using higher doses of dexmedetomidine), thus maintaining spontaneous ventilation and avoiding muscle relaxation during a very stimulating procedure. The amnestic and analgesic properties of dexmedetomidine were particularly helpful. Maintaining spontaneous ventilation with dexmedetomidine as almost the sole anesthetic could be very advantageous and may reduce the risk of complete airway obstruction in the anesthetic management of AMMs."

In this trial, we sought to determine whether a BIS-based protocol is better than a protocol based on a measurement of end-tidal anesthetic gas (ETAG) for decreasing anesthesia awareness in patients at high risk for this complication."

Twenty-three patients were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to one of the three groups. Each patient received one preoperative infusion and three postoperative infusions every 6 hours. Seven patients served as controls and received placebos for all infusions. Eight patients received dexamethasone, 16 mg preoperatively and three placebo postoperative doses. Eight patients received dexamethasone, 16 mg preoperatively and three 8-mg postoperative doses. Facial edema was quantified by computer scanning of standardized photographs. The underlying inflammatory process also was measured using C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and complete blood counts. Five sets of photographic and laboratory data were obtained for each patient: preoperative, day of surgery, and postoperative days 1, 2, and 3. Patients receiving dexamethasone demonstrated significantly less postoperative edema only on postoperative day 1 (P &lt; .05) when measured photographically. C-reactive protein was significantly reduced on postoperative days 1, 2, and 3 (P &lt; .05) in both dexamethasone groups. No significant difference was found between the two dexamethasone groups. Measurement of C-reactive protein seems to be the most sensitive method for comparing the effect of dexamethasone on postoperative inflammation. Preoperative intravenous dexamethasone significantly reduced postoperative inflammation and its associated edema after orthognathic surgery."

        "abstract": "Perioperative use of corticosteroids has been advocated for reduction of pain, edema, and trismus following oral surgical procedures. Clinical trials involving the use of corticosteroids in oral surgery are reviewed with emphasis on the following points: 1) the type of procedure; 2) the specific regimen and its relative potency; and 3) the methods used to determine results. The potential for complications induced by perioperative corticosteroid use, such as adrenal suppression and delayed wound healing, are also discussed. Initial trials subjectively demonstrated that corticosteroids reduced the amount of inflammation associated with oral surgery, especially edema. Subsequent objective evaluation of corticosteroid use has shown consistent reductions in edema. Corticosteroid doses ranged from 80 to 625 mg hydrocortisone equivalent anti-inflammatory dosage. No significant adverse reactions were noted. Based on these studies, the use of perioperative corticosteroids appears to be a safe and rational method of reducing postoperative complications following the removal of impacted third molars. Conclusions about corticosteroid use in other oral surgical procedures cannot be reached until more research is conducted."

The design was a randomized, prospective, double-blind controlled trial. Thirty-eight patients undergoing elective carotid endarterectomy (17 patients were in the steroid-treated group and 21 in the control group) were administered either 16 mg of dexamethasone or saline placebo prior to surgery. Computed tomograms (CT) scans of the neck were performed on the patients preoperatively and 24 h postoperatively. Measurements were taken from the CT scans of the airway transverse and anterior-posterior diameters at the levels of the hyoid bone, arytenoid cartilage, and cricoid cartilage. No postoperative neck hematomas were seen on the CT scans. Although neck edema was observed postoperatively, the upper airway dimensions were not statistically significantly different between the steroid and the control groups. We conclude that steroid administration immediately preoperatively has no clinical effect in reducing edema formation in the upper airway postcarotid endarterectomy."

The panel members critically and systematically evaluated the current medical literature on PONV to provide an evidence-based reference tool for the management of adults and children who are undergoing surgery and are at increased risk for PONV. These guidelines identify patients at risk for PONV in adults and children; recommend approaches for reducing baseline risks for PONV; identify the most effective antiemetic single therapy and combination therapy regimens for PONV prophylaxis, including nonpharmacologic approaches; recommend strategies for treatment of PONV when it occurs; provide an algorithm for the management of individuals at increased risk for PONV as well as steps to ensure PONV prevention and treatment are implemented in the clinical setting."

Therefore, we designed a study to evaluate if the routine use of dexamethasone would facilitate the early recovery process after anorectal surgery. A secondary aim of the study was to determine if dexamethasone would increase the incidence of postoperative wound complications. Eighty adult outpatients undergoing anorectal surgery with a standardized monitored anesthesia care technique were randomly assigned to receive either dexamethasone 4 mg IV or an equal volume of saline before the start of surgery. All patients were premedicated with midazolam 2 mg IV and received ketorolac 30 mg IV as a preemptive analgesic. A propofol infusion, 50 microg. kg(-1). min(-1) IV, was initiated and subsequently titrated to maintain an observer's assessment of alertness/sedation score of 2 or 3 (with 5 = awake/alert to 1 = asleep). Fentanyl 25 microg IV was administered 3-5 min before infiltrating the surgical field with a 30-mL local anesthetic mixture containing 15 mL of lidocaine 1% and 15 mL of bupivacaine 0.25% (with epinephrine 1:200,000 and sodium bicarbonate 3 mL). All patients were fast-tracked directly from the operating room to the step-down recovery area. Even though the incidences of postoperative pain and postoperative nausea and vomiting were small in both treatment groups, the time to \"home readiness\" was significantly shorter in the dexamethasone group. Importantly, there was no increase in the incidence of wound infections (8% vs 12%) or hematoma formation (3% vs 5%) in the dexamethasone (versus saline) group. We conclude that the administration of dexamethasone, 4 mg IV, shortened the time to home readiness without increasing the incidence of postoperative wound infections in a high-risk outpatient population undergoing anorectal surgery."

Depending on the indication, the procedure may be significantly longer in the case of systematic mediastinal staging (distinct nodal stations are identified and targeted for lymph nodes >5 mm). In known or suspected non-small cell lung cancer each of these nodal stations are sampled with multiple needle passes [1,2]. Procedure duration can be 120 minutes or longer depending on the complexity and number of nodal stations that require biopsy. This procedure is traditionally performed either via a large endotracheal tube (ideally 8.5 mm ID or larger) or via a supraglottic airway (SGA) under general anesthesia. It has also been described as being performed transorally with moderate sedation. This procedure is rapidly replacing mediastinoscopy as the primary modality of diagnosing and staging advanced-stage lung cancer.

When general anesthesia is used, a total intravenous anesthetic technique (TIVA), usually an infusion of propofol, is preferred rather than an inhalational anesthetic technique. Compared with an inhalational anesthetic technique, TIVA ensures continuous delivery of the anesthetic and prevents the pollution of the operating room by inhalational anesthetic that can be caused by circuit leaks because of the nature of the procedure [26]. Sarkiss and colleagues [32], also reported observing more bleeding at the needle biopsy site when inhalation anesthetics were used compared with the TIVA technique, presumably because of the vascular dilatory effects of inhalational anesthetics. Inhalational anesthetics may have some advantages in certain situations. We previously described our anesthetic technique [33] for the management of mediastinal mass, when inhalational anesthetics were used to augment the amnestic properties of dexmedetomidine while still maintaining spontaneous ventilation. The potent bronchodilating effect of inhalational anesthetics can be helpful in overcoming the severe bronchospasm often encountered in the third session of thermoplasty for endobronchial treatment of severe asthma, as discussed earlier [5].",

Reducing FiO 2 should also be achieved while maintaining a high fresh gas flow rate. An example of flow rate used at the authors' institution is 12 L/min of air mixed with 1.5 L/min of oxygen, resulting in an FiO 2 around 32%.

There are several different probes made for this purpose and most of them are directed via guide sheath or some other catheter-based system. For radial Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS), risks are associated with the biopsy and are not specifically associated with the imaging technique. The most common risk is pneumothorax, which theoretically may be accentuated with use of positive pressure ventilation; however, this has not definitely been proven [14]. Linear convex probe Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) is a very specific procedure requiring a dedicated bronchoscope. The Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscope is slightly larger than the standard therapeutic bronchoscope. The distal tip has a 6.9-mm outer diameter, a 30 /C14 angle of vision, and slightly limited range of motion. Significant skills are required to perform this procedure beyond those required for standard conventional bronchoscopy [15]. There are 2 separate"

Depending on the indication, the procedure may be significantly longer in the case of systematic mediastinal staging (distinct nodal stations are identified and targeted for lymph nodes >5 mm). In known or suspected non-small cell lung cancer each of these nodal stations are sampled with multiple needle passes [1,2]. Procedure duration can be 120 minutes or longer depending on the complexity and number of nodal stations that require biopsy. This procedure is traditionally performed either via a large endotracheal tube (ideally 8.5 mm ID or larger) or via a supraglottic airway (SGA) under general anesthesia. It has also been described as being performed transorally with moderate sedation. This procedure is rapidly replacing mediastinoscopy as the primary modality of diagnosing and staging advanced-stage lung cancer. Overall this is a safe procedure in which the risks are mainly the same as those associated with other biopsy techniques or damage to the instruments [14,16].",

When general anesthesia is used, a total intravenous anesthetic technique (TIVA), usually an infusion of propofol, is preferred rather than an inhalational anesthetic technique. Compared with an inhalational anesthetic technique, TIVA ensures continuous delivery of the anesthetic and prevents the pollution of the operating room by inhalational anesthetic that can be caused by circuit leaks because of the nature of the procedure [26]. Sarkiss and colleagues [32], also reported observing more bleeding at the needle biopsy site when inhalation anesthetics were used compared with the TIVA technique, presumably because of the vascular dilatory effects of inhalational anesthetics. Inhalational anesthetics may have some advantages in certain situations. We previously described our anesthetic technique [33] for the management of mediastinal mass, when inhalational anesthetics were used to augment the amnestic properties of dexmedetomidine while still maintaining spontaneous ventilation. The potent bronchodilating effect of inhalational anesthetics can be helpful in overcoming the severe bronchospasm often encountered in the third session of thermoplasty for endobronchial treatment of severe asthma, as discussed earlier [5].",

This high FiO 2 needs to be titrated down to less than 40%, preferably around 30% if tolerated, when using laser energy in the airway, and/or electrocautery. Reducing FiO 2 should also be achieved while maintaining a high fresh gas flow rate. An example of flow rate used at the authors' institution is 12 L/min of air mixed with 1.5 L/min of oxygen, resulting in an FiO 2 around 32%. In patients who do not tolerate such a low FiO 2, an alternative treatment strategy should be considered, like the use of cryoablation when FiO2 of 1.0 can be maintained.",
