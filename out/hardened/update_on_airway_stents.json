The patients that benefit the most are those with worse baseline dyspnea, higher American Society of Anesthesiology score, poorer functional status, and central obstruction (rather than lobar). Early complications are relatively rare with stent placement, whereas late complications are not. Stents are a risk factor for lower respiratory tract infection, which, in turn, is a negative prognostic factor in terms of survival. Recent research has seen the development of personalized stents via three-dimensional printing, mini stents for more distal airways, and stents with drug-eluting and biodegradable properties."

Additionally, loss of airway wall strength, such as in tracheobronchomalacia, can lead to airway collapse and obstruction of the lumen. Pure extrinsic compression and wall collapse are treated with stenting if severe enough. Pure intrinsic obstruction can often be dealt with by endoluminal ablative and debulking approaches"

These include infection, formation of granulation tissue, and stent migration - any of which may require repeat bronchoscopy in already debilitated patients (see below for a detailed description of complications based on recent data). Similar consideration must also be given to the fact that stent placement often requires general anesthesia. Importantly, patients with malignant CAO have limited life expectancy and may have specific goals of care that need to be heeded. This is not to suggest that stent placement is a poor choice in someone with a poor prognosis. There can be a definite palliative benefit of stents for dyspneic patients with malignant CAO at the end of life [5]. Finally, from a technical standpoint, there must be patent airways distal to the area of obstruction for stent placement to be successful; if distal patency is not present, stenting will be of no benefit. This can be determined by preprocedural imaging in some circumstances, although often this cannot be known with certainty until the time of bronchoscopy. All of these factors must be considered to make an individualized decision for each patient."

Six patients (0.5%) died due to procedural complications. Risk factors for complications included urgent and emergent procedures, ASA score above 3, redo therapeutic bronchoscopy, and moderate sedation. Unexpected escalation of care occurred in 4.4% of patients, with 1.3% developing unexpected respiratory failure and 0.5% having bleeding requiring intervention.

Death within 30 days of procedure was associated with stent placement, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score above 1, ASA above 3, andintrinsic or mixed obstruction.

One hundred and twenty-two stents were placed in 38 patients, half of whom had malignant lobar airway obstruction.Ninety-fivepercentofpatientshadsymptomatic improvement based on questioning during follow-up.Fifteenof16patientswithpulmonaryfunction testing before and after stent placement had an average increase of 12.3% in forced expiratory volume in 1 second. Overall, complications occurred in 20%, and included migration (10%), granulation tissue formation (5%), deployment malfunction (2%), and stent dislodgement immediately after deployment (2%). Of note, no infections were detected, and the authors theorized that this was due to the small size of the stent, thereby minimizing impairment of mucociliary clearance and expectoration."

Ninety-five per cent of stents were placed in lobar airways; 72% of patients had malignant stenosis. There was a statistically significant improvement in dyspnea as measured by modified Medical Research Council score, from a median of 3 to 2 after stent placement. Complications included migration (9.5%), granulation tissue (9.5%), mucus plugging (4.8%), and stent crush (4.8%); five stents had to be removed due to complications. Seven stents were removed with patency maintained over a median of 170 days, but how many of these were for malignant versus benign disease was not specified."

Whether treatment of small airway stenosis is beneficial and worth the risk is still unknown, because only preliminary data are available. For the standard and widely used stents, the advances have been with regard to understanding their complications,success rates, andutility. As both cancer life expectancy and technology increase over time, the incidence of malignant CAO and the tools available for treatment will likelygrow aswell. Airway stents are well seated to bridge these together."

        "abstract": "Stent placement has been established as a standard procedure for treating airway obstructions. Other indications are localized malacias and fistulas. Though many different stents with various diameters and lengths are available, the shapes are hardly ever ideal because of the distorted anatomy in patients with diseased airways. There are technical and legal limitations for customizing purchased airway stents. Individually tailored stents would be preferable. New techniques of additive manufacturing such as 3D printing make it possible to produce optimized stents for a particular patient. Using CT data and bronchoscopic images, stents can be constructed that match a particular anatomical situation and apply the optimized expansion force. We give an overview of the currently available manufacturing techniques for polymeric stents and report about our own experience. Direct on-site printing of polyurethane stents in a hospital and printing individual extrusion molds for silicone stents in a certified cleanroom are both feasible. Furthermore, there are promising attempts of combining mechanically customized stents with surface modifications, drug-eluting features, biodegradability, and time-dependent adaptation (4D printing). Truly optimized airway stents with the potential of solving the well-known stent problems such as granulation tissue formation, remodeling, mucostasis, and infections are in reach. The technical hurdles are probably easier to overcome than the legal constraints. The legal situations are discussed from a physician's and a manufacturer's perspective."

The advent of 3D-printable biomaterials has created the potential for device control in the fourth dimension: 3D-printed objects that exhibit a designed shape change under tissue growth and resorption conditions over time. Tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) is a condition of excessive collapse of the airways during respiration that can lead to life-threatening cardiopulmonary arrests. We demonstrate the successful application of 3D printing technology to produce a personalized medical device for treatment of TBM, designed to accommodate airway growth while preventing external compression over a predetermined time period before bioresorption. We implanted patient-specific 3D-printed external airway splints in three infants with severe TBM. At the time of publication, these infants no longer exhibited life-threatening airway disease and had demonstrated resolution of both pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications of their TBM. Long-term data show continued growth of the primary airways. This process has broad application for medical manufacturing of patient-specific 3D-printed devices that adjust to tissue growth through designed mechanical and degradation behaviors over time."

Despite the increased adoption of rapid prototyping and additive manufacturing techniques in the health-care field, many physicians lack the technical skill set to use this exciting and useful technology. Additionally, the growth in the 3D printing sector brings an ever-increasing number of 3D printers and printable materials. Therefore, it is important for clinicians to keep abreast of this rapidly developing field in order to benefit. In this Ahead of the Curve, we review the history of 3D printing from its inception to the most recent biomedical applications. Additionally, we will address some of the major barriers to wider adoption of the technology in the medical field. Finally, we will provide an initial guide to 3D modeling and printing by demonstrating how to design a personalized airway prosthesis via 3D Slicer. We hope this information will reduce the barriers to use and increase clinician participation in the 3D printing health-care sector."

Novel targeted therapies are already on the market and several others are under investigation. However non-specific cytotoxic agents still remain the cornerstone of treatment for many patients. Central airways stenosis or obstruction may often complicate and decrease quality of life and survival of these patients. Interventional pulmonology modalities (mainly debulking and stent placement) can alleviate symptoms related to airways stenosis and improve the quality of life of patients. Mitomycin C and sirolimus have been observed to assist a successful stent placement by reducing granuloma tissue formation. Additionally, these drugs enhance the normal tissue ability against cancer cell infiltration. In this mini review we will concentrate on mitomycin C and sirolimus and their use in stent placement."

Historically, distal bronchial stenting within lobar and segmental bronchi has not been amenable to stenting. In addition, there are questionable benefits to stenting small airways. The Atrium iCast stent is a polytetrafluoroethylene covered stainless steel balloon deployed stent which can be deployed through a flexible bronchoscope under direct visualization. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility, complications, and long-term impact of using this stent in patients with lobar bronchial stenosis either secondary to malignancy or benign etiologies."

In terms of overall survival, silicone stents and tracheal stents were associated with decreased mortality, whereas LRTI and prestent radiation therapy were associated with the converse. Possibly, there was some degree of selection bias associated with silicone stent placement, as these may have been placed in healthier patients who are thereby better able to tolerate the more technically difficult placement of these stents compared with metal stents. Silicone stents are also easier to remove. There may have been a bias toward placing these in patients whose disease burden was expected to improve, thereby allowing stent removal later.",

[11] created 3D airway splints that were surgically placed around main stem bronchi in three infants with tracheobronchomalacia. Two were eventually able to be liberated from mechanical ventilation completely. A feasibility study is currently under way to test this approach in a series of patients [12].",

Additionally, in lung cancer patients after lung resection, losing a single lobe would be losing a larger percentage of gas exchange area than if they had two full lungs. This same reasoning can be applied for single lung transplant patients who are living with a single functional lung. Therefore, preserving function of a single lobe may be quite beneficial.",
