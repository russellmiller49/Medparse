    "abstract": "Percutaneous tracheostomy is a commonly performed procedure for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) and offers many benefits, including decreasing ICU length of stay and need for sedation while improving patient comfort, effective communication, and airway clearance. However, there is no consensus on the optimal timing of tracheostomy in ICU patients. Ultrasound (US) and bronchoscopy are useful adjunct tools to optimize procedural performance. US can be used pre-procedurally to identify vascular structures and to select the optimal puncture site, intra-procedurally to assist with accurate placement of the introducer needle, and post-procedurally to evaluate for a pneumothorax. Bronchoscopy provides real-time visual guidance from within the tracheal lumen and can reduce complications, such as paratracheal puncture and injury to the posterior tracheal wall. A step-by-step detailed procedural guide, including preparation and procedural technique, is provided with a team-based approach. Technical aspects, such as recommended equipment and selection of appropriate tracheostomy tube type and size, are discussed. Certain procedural considerations to minimize the risk of complications should be given in circumstances of patient obesity, coagulopathy, or neurologic illness. Herein, we provide a practical state of the art review of percutaneous tracheostomy in ICU patients. Specifically, we will address pre-procedural preparation, procedural technique, and post-tracheostomy management.",

It also shortens the ICU length of stay and provides physiologic benefits by decreasing the work of breathing compared to endotracheal tubes (ETTs). The resistance to laminar gas flow through a tube is represented by Poiseuille's equation, R α (viscosity × length)/r 4 .  Tracheostomy tubes are shorter in length than ETTs, thus decreasing airway resistance. A variety of tracheostomy tubes are available, and those with a longer radius of curvature and smoother inner surface contribute to lower flow resistance (6). They are also more rigid and less likely to be kinked (7). A higher tracheostomy tube diameter also decreases the work of breathing (8) ."

Other studies have demonstrated no mortality benefit of early tracheostomy (17-21). A metaanalysis of 13 trials (2,434 patients) demonstrated that allcause mortality was not significantly lower in patients with an early ( ≤ 7 days of mechanical ventilation) versus late (>7 days) tracheostomy (17)."

Thus, it is understandable why the timing of tracheostomy significantly varies in practice (24).

This can be overcome with appropriate ventilator setting changes, the use of a smaller diameter bronchoscope, minimizing suctioning during bronchoscopy, and shortening the length of time the bronchoscope is in the ETT (47). Although transient hypercarbia is usually tolerable, special attention needs to be given to patients with intracranial injury/surgery, in which this acidosis can lead to elevated intracranial pressure and decreased cerebral perfusion pressure (44,47). For patients with an unstable neurological condition or significant hypoxia with high FiO2 and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) requirements, end-tidal CO 2 monitoring and short bronchoscopy cycles are essential. In addition, the needle entry could be performed with US-guidance, then subsequently confirmed with bronchoscopy to mitigate risks of hypercarbia. Otherwise, we recommend the use of bronchoscopy-guidance when possible. Ensuring that the inside diameter of the ETT is ≥ 2.0 mm larger than the outside diameter of the bronchoscope will help to maintain delivery of tidal volume and minimize the development of auto-PEEP (48)."

Tracheostomy tube dimensions to consider include inner diameter (ID), outer diameter (OD), length, and curvature. The published ID of the tube is the functional ID, so it includes the inner canula if it is required for connection to the ventilator. If the ID is too small, then airway clearance may be impaired, and a higher cuff pressure may be required to create a seal in the trachea.

Prophylactic low-dose heparin does not increase the risk of bleeding; however, therapeutic heparin should be held prior to the planned procedure (77,78). Uremia can cause platelet dysfunction, which could increase the risk of perioperative bleeding; thus, patients with endstage kidney disease should undergo dialysis as close as possible prior to the scheduled procedure time. One dose of desmopressin may be given one hour prior to the procedure to decrease the risk of uremic bleeding (82,83)."

A systematic review of 7 studies that included 1,271 cases evaluated the outcomes of  post-percutaneous tracheostomy chest X-rays in adults.  Forty  cases  (3.2%)  developed  complications detected on chest X-ray, which included atelectasis (n=24), pneumothorax (n=6), subcutaneous emphysema (n=6), pneumomediastinum (n=3), and tracheostomy tube malposition (n=1). However, only 22 patients (1.8%) required intervention. A significant number of patients that developed post-procedure complications had signs and symptoms, and a significantly lower complication rate was reported in PDT performed with bronchoscopic guidance (1.6% vs. 9.3%). Thus, obtaining a routine X-ray post-tracheostomy has low impact on clinical management, especially if the procedure was under bronchoscopic guidance. It may be considered for highrisk patients or those who had a difficult or emergent tracheostomy (84)."

They shortened the duration of sutures from 7-10 to 7 days and enforced keeping the neck in a neutral position with frequent skin assessment performed by the nursing staff. Their protocol led to a decrease in  the  incidence of TRAPUs from 10.9% (20/183) to 1.3% (2/155). Similar results were replicated by Dixon et  al. They implemented a protocol for both surgical and percutaneous tracheostomy care and shortened the duration of sutures to 5 days. An 80% decline in TRAPUs was observed. A loose suturing technique by tightening square knots down onto the short dilator or the mosquito clamps has also been used (86)."

Quality improvement projects including these components have been shown to reduce adverse events and improve patient safety (88). The use of a post-tracheostomy care bundle in a study of 393 patients significantly improved rates of decannulation and tolerance of an oral diet. The bundle included (I) an electronic postoperative tracheostomy order set (including automatic respiratory therapy and speech consultations; tracheostomy care; team contact information), (II) tracking and following system, (III) decannulation protocol that empowers RT and SLP, and (IV) tracheostomy rounds (89). A meta-analysis of 7 studies evaluating multidisciplinary tracheostomy teams identified a reduction in the total tracheostomy time with a mean difference of 8 days (90). Similarly, the time to decannulation after ICU discharge decreased from an average of 14 to 7 days in a study of an intensivist-led tracheostomy team in a study of 280 patients (91)."

US can be used to assist with accurate placement of the introducer needle while avoiding vascular structures but does not allow for identification of the posterior membrane. Thus, bronchoscopy provides real-time visual guidance from within the tracheal lumen to decrease the risk of posterior membrane injury. The selection of appropriate tracheostomy type and size can minimize complications. Certain additional procedural considerations should be given in circumstances of patient obesity, coagulopathy, or neurologic illness to mitigate risks. A multidisciplinary team-based approach to posttracheostomy care decreases the time to decannulation."

        "to": "Percutaneous tracheostomy is a commonly performed procedure for patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) and offers many benefits, including decreasing ICU length of stay and need for sedation while improving patient comfort, effective communication, and airway clearance. However, there is no consensus on the optimal timing of tracheostomy in ICU patients. Ultrasound (US) and bronchoscopy are useful adjunct tools to optimize procedural performance. US can be used pre-procedurally to identify vascular structures and to select the optimal puncture site, intra-procedurally to assist with accurate placement of the introducer needle, and post-procedurally to evaluate for a pneumothorax. Bronchoscopy provides real-time visual guidance from within the tracheal lumen and can reduce complications, such as paratracheal puncture and injury to the posterior tracheal wall. A step-by-step detailed procedural guide, including preparation and procedural technique, is provided with a team-based approach. Technical aspects, such as recommended equipment and selection of appropriate tracheostomy tube type and size, are discussed. Certain procedural considerations to minimize the risk of complications should be given in circumstances of patient obesity, coagulopathy, or neurologic illness. Herein, we provide a practical state of the art review of percutaneous tracheostomy in ICU patients. Specifically, we will address pre-procedural preparation, procedural technique, and post-tracheostomy management.",

Four of the 5 cases of accidental decannulation occurred in the obese group, thus highlighting another post-operative risk in this patient population (39). Similarly, in a comparative study of ST in 89 morbidly obese patients (BMI ≥ 40), complication rates were higher in the obese group (25% vs. 14%; P=0.03). Morbid obesity was found to be an independent variable associated with increased risk of tracheostomy-related complications (71). However, other studies deemed PDT safe in obese patients (72-74).",

There was no significant difference in the complication rates between the two groups (6.5% in each group) with no reported deaths (73). PDT in obese patients may carry a higher risk than nonobese patients given the large neck circumference and short suprasternal part of the trachea; however, studies evaluating this are limited to retrospective studies. The adjunct use of bronchoscopy and proper sizing of the tracheostomy tube, such as extra length tubes, when indicated can help",

The number of sutures to be placed and the timing of suture removal are not well studied, and surgeons have anecdotally adopted the 4-quadrant technique (2 sutures on each side) to secure the tracheostomy tube and prevent its dislodgment (86).",
