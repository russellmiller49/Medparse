Limitations in existing guided bronchoscopy platforms has led to developments in robotic assisted technologies. These devices may allow the bronchoscopist to more precisely maneuver the scope and instruments into the periphery of the lungs under direct visualization while also ensuring stability during sampling of the target lesions. These devices have the potential to improve the diagnostic yield in sampling peripheral lung lesions and may play a role in the treatment of non-operable or oligometastatic peripheral tumors using bronchoscopic ablative therapies. In this article, we review the existing robotic bronchoscopy technologies and summarize the available pre-clinical and clinical data supporting their use.",

An estimated 1.6 million new pulmonary nodules are predicted to be detected every year in the USA (1). These statistics present a new challenge for physicians caring for these patients. The National Lung Screening and NELSON trials both showed that a significant number of patients had a positive screen, and majority of these nodules (~80%) were located in the periphery of the lung (2-4). The American College of Chest Physicians and National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines recommend diagnosis of the primary lesion, staging and obtaining tissue for genomic alterations and PD-L1 status using the least invasive modality and ideally in a single procedure (5,6).

Limitations in existing guided bronchoscopy platforms has led to developments in robotic assisted technologies. These devices may allow the bronchoscopist to more precisely maneuver the scope and instruments into the periphery of the lungs under direct visualization while also ensuring stability during sampling of the target lesions. These devices have the potential to improve the diagnostic yield in sampling peripheral lung lesions and may play a role in the treatment of non-operable or oligometastatic peripheral tumors using bronchoscopic ablative therapies. In this article, we review the existing robotic bronchoscopy technologies and summarize the available pre-clinical and clinical data supporting their use."

EMN was thus introduced to guide navigation to these peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs) but lacked direct visualization of the airways. The use of EMN has been combined with r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) to increase diagnostic yield but continues to be limited by respiratory motion and CT-to-body divergence. These limitations in guided bronchoscopy led to the introduction of the robotic assisted bronchoscopy (RAB) systems that allows the operator to navigate through smaller airways under direct visualization while continuing to offer either EMN guidance  (Monarch TM platform by Auris Health Inc.) or Shape Sensing Technology (Ion TM Endoluminal System by Intuitive Surgical) to find target airways and provide stability during sampling of the target lesion."

In the 1990's, the AESOP (Automated Endoscopic System for Optimal Positioning) robotic platform became the first system approved by the FDA for its use during endoscopic surgical procedures. In 2000, the Da Vinci Surgery System was approved by the FDA for general laparoscopic surgery (10). Since then, the use robotics has expanded from the field of general surgery, to gynecologic surgery and urological surgery as well as cardiac and thoracic surgery and has become an integral part of surgical procedures in the United States. The first robotic system to be introduced in the field of bronchoscopy was the Monarch TM platform by Auris Health and received FDA approval in March 2018. Subsequently another robotic bronchoscopy platform, Ion TM Endoluminal System developed by Intuitive Surgical received FDA approval in February 2019. The introduction of robotic bronchoscopy to the field of Interventional Pulmonology has been a source of great excitement in the era of lung cancer screening."

The first study of the Monarch TM platform was performed on cadavers to assess the reach of the RAB platform compared to a conventional thin bronchoscope with a similar outer diameter (4.2 mm). A guidewire was inserted into each segmental bronchi till  it  reached  the  pleura as noted on fluoroscopy. The conventional thin bronchoscope was then advanced over the guidewire as far as possible. The bronchoscope was then removed and the Monarch TM RAB system was advanced over the guidewire to its maximum extent. In each of the segments, the Monarch TM RAB platform had farther access to the periphery of the lung compared to the bronchoscope (9 th vs. 6 th airway generations). This was likely due to the structural support provided by the RAB system while the inner scope was advanced. In comparison, the conventional bronchoscope was noted to prolapse in the trachea when trying to be advanced to the apical segments. Another reason was likely the ability of the RAB system to negotiate subtle turns and bifurcations in the distal airways allowing for further maneuverability (11).",

Majority (80%) of the nodules were placed in the periphery with the mean size of 16.5 mm (±1.5 mm) and 50% of the nodules had a positive bronchus sign. Nodule localization was achieved in 100% cases with the RAB platform vs 85% with EMN guidance and 65% with the use of UTBrEBUS. Once the biopsy was performed using a needle, the relationship of the needle to the lesion was studied using cone beam CT. Successful puncture of the nodule (defined as the needle in the nodule or going through the nodule) was noted in 80% cases with the Ion TM RAB platform compared to 45% with EMN (P=0.022) and 25% with the use of UTB-rEBUS (P<0.001). Even in the lesions that were missed, the median needle to miss distance was noted to be 4 mm (3-5 mm) in the RAB platform compared to 7 mm (4-9 mm) with EMN guidance and 13 mm (6-28 mm) with the use of UTB-rEBUS. The authors stated that the Ion TM RAB platform increased the ability to localize and precisely puncture peripheral nodules (22). The study has several limitations. There is no evidence to suggest that implanted lesions mimic real lung tumors, therefore the generalizability of this study's findings is highly questionable. In addition, there are concerns about the validity of the EMN testing, as it appears that industry's standard operating procedures (in regards to room mapping, etc.) were not followed in this study."

The small OD of bronchoscope also helps the scope to be wedged and locked in the target segment, which can allow for tamponade and containment of the bleeding.

RAB platforms may increase the accuracy in guiding the catheters to peripheral lesions and provide a stable platform to deliver ablative therapies (4,27).

Limitations in existing guided bronchoscopy platforms has led to developments in robotic assisted technologies. These devices may allow the bronchoscopist to more precisely maneuver the scope and instruments into the periphery of the lungs under direct visualization while also ensuring stability during sampling of the target lesions. These devices have the potential to improve the diagnostic yield in sampling peripheral lung lesions and may play a role in the treatment of non-operable or oligometastatic peripheral tumors using bronchoscopic ablative therapies. In this article, we review the existing robotic bronchoscopy technologies and summarize the available pre-clinical and clinical data supporting their use.",

The first study of the Monarch TM platform was performed on cadavers to assess the reach of the RAB platform compared to a conventional thin bronchoscope with a similar outer diameter (4.2 mm). A guidewire was inserted into each segmental bronchi till  it  reached  the  pleura as noted on fluoroscopy. The conventional thin bronchoscope was then advanced over the guidewire as far as possible. The bronchoscope was then removed and the Monarch TM RAB system was advanced over the guidewire to its maximum extent. In each of the segments, the Monarch TM RAB platform had farther access to the periphery of the lung compared to the bronchoscope (9 th vs. 6 th airway generations). This was likely due to the structural support provided by the RAB system while the inner scope was advanced. In comparison, the conventional bronchoscope was noted to prolapse in the trachea when trying to be advanced to the apical segments. Another reason was likely the ability of the RAB system to negotiate subtle turns and bifurcations in the distal airways allowing for further maneuverability (11).",

The overall diagnostic yield was 79.3% with a diagnostic yield for malignancy of 88% (21). The high yield, especially for cases with an eccentric r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) view was attributed to the ability to visualize peripheral airways and the ability to deploy the TBNA needle perpendicular to the airway/bronchus, towards the lesion.",

The platforms also allow for direct visualization of the peripheral airways, and with one system, direct visualization of the biopsy tools as they are advanced outside the working channel. This can ensure that the bronchoscopist continues to remain in the target airway and also enables the bronchoscopist to steer the tools towards the target ( Figure 1 ). This is relevant for practice as studies to date have shown that the ability to maneuver the scope and precisely guide the instruments can help increase the yield in targets with an eccentric r-Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) view.  The small OD of bronchoscope also helps the scope to be wedged and locked in the target segment, which can allow for tamponade and containment of the bleeding. The published evidence, system specifications, accessory tools as well as the potential advantages and disadvantages of both RAB systems currently available commercially are summarized in Table 1 .",

A guidewire was inserted into each segmental bronchi till  it  reached  the  pleura as noted on fluoroscopy. The conventional thin bronchoscope was then advanced over the guidewire as far as possible. The bronchoscope was then removed and the Monarch TM RAB system was advanced over the guidewire to its maximum extent. In each of the segments, the Monarch TM RAB platform had farther access to the periphery of the lung compared to the bronchoscope (9 th vs. 6 th airway generations). This was likely due to the structural support provided by the RAB system while the inner scope was advanced. In comparison, the conventional bronchoscope was noted to prolapse in the trachea when trying to be advanced to the apical segments.
