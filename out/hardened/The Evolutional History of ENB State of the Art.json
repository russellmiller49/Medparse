With the mechanical tracking system, it was the angulation of the joint that located the proximal end; with the optical system, it was where the re /uniFB02 ectors were located on the surgical instrument.

To track the position of the sensor probe, one must /uniFB01 rst understand the geometry of the electromagnetic /uniFB01 eld. This was made possible by André-Marie Ampère (1820), who described the electromagnetic effect as the force that one current exerts upon another. Biot and Savart further de /uniFB01 ned this effect in 1824 by mathematically modeling the magnetic /uniFB01 eld generated by an electric current. 22 Also, once the reference /uniFB01 eld is known, one must be able to detect it via the sensor probe through magnetic induction. It was Michael Faraday in 1831 who proved empirically that a changing magnetic /uniFB01 eld induces an electric current inside a coil that can be detected. 22 In 1832, Joseph Henry further developed the practical application of Faraday ' s work. 22"

        "abstract": "Cancer is the leading cause of death among Hispanics/Latinos, who represent the largest racial/ethnic minority group in the United States, accounting for 17.8% (57.5 million) of the total population in the continental United States and Hawaii in 2016. In addition, more than 3 million Hispanic Americans live in the US territory of Puerto Rico. Every 3 years, the American Cancer Society reports on cancer occurrence, risk factors, and screening for Hispanics in the United States based on data from the National Cancer Institute, the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For the first time, contemporary incidence and mortality rates for Puerto Rico, which has a 99% Hispanic population, are also presented. An estimated 149,100 new cancer cases and 42,700 cancer deaths will occur among Hispanics in the continental United States and Hawaii in 2018. For all cancers combined, Hispanics have 25% lower incidence and 30% lower mortality compared with non-Hispanic whites, although rates of infection-related cancers, such as liver, are up to twice as high in Hispanics. However, these aggregated data mask substantial heterogeneity within the Hispanic population because of variable cancer risk, as exemplified by the substantial differences in the cancer burden between island Puerto Ricans and other US Hispanics. For example, during 2011 to 2015, prostate cancer incidence rates in Puerto Rico (146.6 per 100,000) were 60% higher than those in other US Hispanics combined (91.6 per 100,000) and 44% higher than those in non-Hispanic whites (101.7 per 100,000). Prostate cancer is also the leading cause of cancer death among men in Puerto Rico, accounting for nearly 1 in 6 cancer deaths during 2011-2015, whereas lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among other US Hispanic men combined. Variations in cancer risk are driven by differences in exposure to cancer-causing infectious agents and behavioral risk factors as well as the prevalence of screening. Strategies for reducing cancer risk in Hispanic populations include targeted, culturally appropriate interventions for increasing the uptake of preventive services and reducing cancer risk factor prevalence, as well as additional funding for Puerto Rico-specific and subgroup-specific cancer research and surveillance."

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy and efficacy of the Radionics Operating Arm System (OAS; Radionics Applications Software, Burlington, MA) in a routine clinical setup. The OAS is a frameless stereotactic articulated arm that can be used in conjunction with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to provide image-based intraoperative navigation. The system was used in 130 consecutive cases. It failed or was considered unreliable in 4.6% of patients. Among the remaining patients, 103 had OAS-guided craniotomies, 11 had frameless stereotactic biopsies, and 10 had OAS-guided anterior cervical surgery. Patients were imaged 3-12 hours prior to surgery. Skin markers were used in all cases. The OAS accuracy was evaluated by measuring the difference between the actual probe position and its analogous position on the images. Frameless stereotactic biopsies were performed using the OAS, a modified probe, and a twist-drill. Anterior cervical surgery was performed using the OAS, MRI images, and a rigid cervical collar. The duration of the procedure was recorded for the first 50 patients, and the value of the OAS in localizing the site of craniotomy, the margin of the lesion, and the extent of the resection was also recorded. The system was associated with insignificant prolongation of procedure setup and was sufficiently reliable and achieved a useful registration in 124 (95.4%) patients. The mean accuracy of the system, using skin markers, was 2.5 mm. The OAS was also adaptable for performing other tasks, such as an interactive needle biopsy without a frame. Its use in conjunction with a hollow probe, to perform biopsy or aspiration of 11 brain lesions, produced 100% positive results. Its use in conjunction with MRI and a cervical collar fiducial system, to perform anterior cervical surgery in 10 patients, localized the level in all patients. Overall, the Radionics OAS was sufficiently reliable and accurate in a wide range of routine neurosurgical procedures. Therefore, we integrated it into our routine neurosurgical practice."

Recent advances in computer technology are making it possible for surgeons to interact with three-dimensional CT and MR images. Initial interactive navigation systems tracked the position of surgical instruments on previously acquired images using optical, ultrasonic, or electromagnetic devices. More recently, real-time imaging and instrument tracking have become possible, such as with the open interventional MR scanners. The problems created by patient motion and tissue deformation during manipulation may thereby be overcome."

        "abstract": "Endoscopic treatment of diseases of the paranasal sinuses provides excellent visualization for minimally invasive surgery, and has evolved into a high-volume procedure with documented navigational risks to surrounding vital structures. Image-guidance systems use the data acquired during CT studies of the sinuses, which is processed through a workstation. Following a registration procedure, the coordinates of the tip of the surgical instrument being used are tracked and displayed in three views. The surgeon is then able to monitor the endoscopic work being done in the operative field and simultaneously document the precise location of the tip of the tracked instrument. Ideally, these systems will allow surgeons to accurately perform surgery with increased safety and improve long-term outcomes. Although the accuracies of these systems have been studied and reported [23,37], further large studies are needed to prove or disprove the impact of navigational systems on reducing surgical risk and improving surgical outcomes.Image-guidance systems employing optical and electromagnetic technologies have been clinically available for nearly 10 years, available during a time when there is an increased awareness of the risks of medical treatment and an emphasis on reducing errors. There is a need to prove that this technology, despite its added costs [39], ultimately improves safety and lowers the surgical risk of endoscopic sinus surgery. Only at that juncture can a mandate be made for including these systems in all procedures. There is universal agreement, however, that the use of this equipment can never bea substitute for surgical skill, training, or judgment."

        "abstract": "Object tracking is a key enabling technology in the context of computer-assisted medical interventions. Allowing the continuous localization of medical instruments and patient anatomy, it is a prerequisite for providing instrument guidance to subsurface anatomical structures. The only widely used technique that enables real-time tracking of small objects without line-of-sight restrictions is electromagnetic (EM) tracking. While EM tracking has been the subject of many research efforts, clinical applications have been slow to emerge. The aim of this review paper is therefore to provide insight into the future potential and limitations of EM tracking for medical use. We describe the basic working principles of EM tracking systems, list the main sources of error, and summarize the published studies on tracking accuracy, precision and robustness along with the corresponding validation protocols proposed. State-of-the-art approaches to error compensation are also reviewed in depth. Finally, an overview of the clinical applications addressed with EM tracking is given. Throughout the paper, we report not only on scientific progress, but also provide a review on commercial systems. Given the continuous debate on the applicability of EM tracking in medicine, this paper provides a timely overview of the state-of-the-art in the field."

With recent data revealing mortality benefits with lung cancer screening via low-dose computed tomography, now more than ever, clinicians will be challenged with the task of providing the means to provide a safe and minimally invasive method of obtaining accurate tissue diagnostics for the pulmonary nodule. In this review, we present available technologies to aid clinicians in attempts at minimally invasive techniques and the data supporting their use. In addition, we review novel tools under investigation that may further increase yield and provide additional benefit in obtaining an early diagnosis of lung cancer."

Navigation is performed in a magnetic field and, therefore, has been considered relatively contraindicated in patients with pacemakers and automated implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (AICDs). Potential risks include altering the function and shutting off the device, device damage, lead displacement, and potential overheating. Over the past decade, there has been extensive literature about the safety of pacemakers in either the 1.5-T or 3-T magnetic fields used in current MRI scanners. Although the magnetic field used in ENB is significantly weaker, 0.0001 T or approximately equal to the earth's gravity, its safety in patients with pacemakers is yet to be elucidated. We present our initial experience with ENB in patients with cardiac implanted electrical devices."

The study was conducted in a tertiary medical centre on 40 consecutive patients considered unsuitable for straightforward surgery or computed tomography (CT)-guided transthoracic needle aspiration biopsy, due to comorbidities. The lung lesion diameter was mean+/-sem 23.5+/-1.5 mm and the depth from the visceral-costal pleura was 14.9+/-2 mm. Navigation was facilitated by an electromagnetic tracking system which could detect a position sensor incorporated into a flexible catheter advanced through a bronchoscope. Information obtained during bronchoscopy was superimposed on previously acquired CT data. Divergence between CT data and data obtained during bronchoscopy was calculated by the system's software as a measure of navigational accuracy. All but one of the target lesions was reached and the overall diagnostic yield was 62.5% (25-40). Diagnostic yield was significantly affected by CT-to-body divergence; yield was 77.2% when estimated divergence was &lt;or=4 mm. Three pneumothoraces occurred and chest drainage was required in one case. Electromagnetic navigation-guided bronchoscopy has the potential to improve the diagnostic yield of transbronchial biopsies without additional fluoroscopic guidance, and may be useful in the early diagnosis of lung cancer, particularly in nonoperable patients."

        "abstract": "Many peripheral lung lesions are beyond the reach of conventional bronchoscopes, and require percutaneous CT-guided or open surgical biopsy, which carry increased risks to the patient. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) is a relatively new technique, which uses an image guided localization system to direct steerable bronchoscopic tools to predetermined points within the bronchial tree. This technology allows improved access to peripheral lesions in particular. We investigated the sensitivity and specificity of ENB-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) in the diagnosis of lung lesions. All ENB-guided FNAs performed at one institution were included in the study. The superDimension i-Logic System&#x2122; was used in all cases. Pathologic reports of the ENB-guided FNAs, as well as all other pulmonary sampling performed simultaneously with the FNA and within 1 year of the ENB-guided FNA were reviewed. Patients with a positive ENB-guided FNA or malignancy within the same lobe within the follow-up period were considered positive for malignancy. Patients with an atypical diagnosis but no definitive malignancy were considered negative for malignancy for statistical purposes. Ninety-one patients underwent 95 ENB-guided FNAs over a 3-year period. Thirty-five patients (38%) were positive for malignancy. ENB-guided FNA had a sensitivity of 63% for the detection of malignancy. The sensitivity for the detection of malignancy using all ENB-guided sampling methods, including FNA, bronchoscopic biopsy, and bronchial brushing was 83%. Pathologists and cytotechnologists should be aware of ENB-guided FNA as an emerging technology with a relatively high sensitivity for the diagnosis of peripheral lung lesions."

        "abstract": "Multiple guidance modalities may be combined during bronchoscopic investigation of peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs). The relative contribution of each modality to diagnostic performance remains uncertain.Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) with virtual bronchoscopy (VB) was routinely performed, with electromagnetic navigation (EMN) utilised only where EBUS was unable to locate PPLs or where the probe was adjacent to the lesion and on-site cytologic examination was nondiagnostic.236 consecutive patients with 245 PPLs had lesion size 22.8&#xb1;12.4&#x2005;mm (mean&#xb1;sd). PPLs were localised using EBUS+VB alone in 188 (77%) and was diagnostic in 134 of these (71.3%). EBUS localisation was predicted by PPL size (23.7&#xb1;10.5 versus 19.7&#xb1;9.8&#x2005;mm, p=0.003), but not by bronchus sign, PPL-hilum distance or PPL-pleura distance. EMN in 57 patients achieved EBUS localisation in a further 17 patients (30.9%), improving overall visualisation yield to 85%. Nine of these 57 procedures achieved a definitive diagnosis (16%), improving overall diagnostic yield to 58.4%. Probe position and lesion type influenced overall diagnostic yield. Sensitivity for diagnosis of lung cancer was 70% (131/188; 95% CI 63-76%).Localisation rate and diagnostic sensitivity of radial probe EBUS+VB alone for diagnosis of PPLs is high. EBUS localisation rates and procedural yield are improved only modestly (by 8% and 4%, respectively) with addition of EMN. Sampling following EMN should include all available methods to maximise diagnostic yield."

As a result, more patients with pulmonary nodules, many with subcentimeter lesions, are being referred to thoracic surgeons, some with concern for primary lung neoplasm and others with possible metastatic lung lesions. Obtaining a definitive diagnosis of these lesions is difficult. Electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy (ENB)-guided pleural dye marking followed by thoracoscopic resection is a novel alternative technique for definitive diagnosis. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and our initial experience with ENB-guided dye localization and minimally invasive resection for diagnosis of lung lesions."

Surgical biopsy is more difficult for these lesions because intraoperative localization has to be made without the aid of direct visualization or manual palpation. Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy can be used in the operating room to identify a small peripheral lesion and marked using an injection of methylene blue, which can be seen on the visceral pleura of the lung. We present our initial experience using this technique. The sample was eight patients who had peripheral lesions with an average size of 19 mm. Surgical wedge biopsy was diagnostic in all cases, with an average procedure time of 28 minutes. There were no complications from this procedure. In conclusion, these data suggest that electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy can be performed safely with high diagnostic accuracy by the operating thoracic surgeon, but further data are needed to establish its utility and safety."

        "abstract": "The emergence of Electromagnetic Navigational Bronchoscopy (ENB) as a diagnostic tool for small peripheral lung nodules has introduced a new method for delivery of fiducial markers. This technique has not been well studied in the literature. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ENB when used in fiducial marker placement. We reviewed all patients undergoing ENB fiducial placement between June 2010 and February 2014 (n = 64). These 64 patients had 68 lung lesions, in which we placed a total of 190 markers. Primary end points were marker retention and postoperative complications. The retention rate for the study was 82 per cent (n = 156). Upper lobe lesions had a 78 per cent retention rate and the middle/lower lobe lesions had an 89 per cent retention rate; the difference was not significant (P = 0.126). Complications included hospital admissions, respiratory failure, and pneumothorax. The difference in complication rates between upper and middle/lower lobe markers was not significant. We found ENB to be a safe method for the placement of fiducial markers. We also found that placement of an average of three markers/lesion led to an adequate retention rate to allow for successful treatment of lung cancer in nonsurgical patients using lung-sparing stereotactic radiation."

        "abstract": "Management of pulmonary nodules in terms of diagnosis and intraoperative localization can be challenging, especially in the minimal invasive video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) approach, and may be even more difficult with single port VATS with limited access. The ability to localize small lesions intraoperatively is particularly important for excisional biopsy for diagnostic frozen section, as well as to guide sublobar resection. Some of the common techniques to aid localization include preoperative percutaneous hookwire localization, colour dye or radio-dye labelling injection of the nodule or adjacent site to allowing visualization or detection by radioactive counter intraoperatively. The use of hybrid operating room (OR) for intraoperative localization of lung nodules was first reported in 2013, and was called image guided VATS (iVATS). Subsequently, we have expanded the iVATS application for single port VATS major lung resection of small or ground-glass opacity lesions. By performing an on-table cone-beam CT scan, real-time and accurate assessment of the pulmonary lesion can be made, which can aid the localization process. Other types of physical or colour marker that can be deployed percutaneously in the hybrid OR immediate before surgery can enhance haptic feedback and sensitivity of digital palpation, as well as provide a radiopaque nidus for radiological confirmation. In the past decade, the electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) technology had developed into a useful adjunct technology for the localization of peripheral lung nodules by injection of marking agent or deployment of fiducial to the lesion through the endobronchial route causing much lower marking agent diffusion and artefacts. Recently, the combination of hybrid OR and ENB for lung nodule localization and marking has further increased the accuracy and applicability of the technology. The article will be exploring the latest development of the above approaches to lung nodule localization, and discuss some of the techniques' advantages and flaws."

The recommendations are designed to help individuals and organizations maintain ethical and transparent publication practices and comply with legal and regulatory requirements. These recommendations cover publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations (oral or poster) at scientific congresses. The International Society for Medical Publication Professionals invited more than 3000 professionals worldwide to apply for a position on the steering committee, or as a reviewer, for this guideline. The GPP2 authors reviewed all applications (n&#xa0;= 241) and assembled an 18-member steering committee that represented 7 countries and a diversity of publication professions and institutions. From the 174 selected reviewers, 94 sent comments on the second draft, which steering committee members incorporated after discussion and consensus. The resulting guideline includes new sections (Principles of Good Publication Practice for Company-Sponsored Medical Research, Data Sharing, Studies That Should Be Published, and Plagiarism), expands guidance on the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors' authorship criteria and common authorship issues, improves clarity on appropriate author payment and reimbursement, and expands information on the role of medical writers. By following good publication practices (including GPP3), individuals and organizations will show integrity; accountability; and responsibility for accurate, complete, and transparent reporting in their publications and presentations."

        "abstract": "The era of bronchoscopy began with Gustav Killian in 1876 when he removed a pork bone from a farmer's airway, using an esophagoscope. Prompted by this accomplishment, Chevalier Jackson, an American otolaryngologist, laid the platform for the modern-day rigid bronchoscope in the early twentieth century. In 1967 Shigeto Ikeda revolutionized the field of bronchoscopy by his innovation of the fiberoptic bronchoscope. Today, bronchoscopy and interventional pulmonology have become an integral part of pulmonary medicine and an established subspecialty. Numerous innovators have furthered the horizons of this technology. In the early 1980s Ko-Pen Wang introduced transbronchial needle aspiration to sample mediastinal lesions while Jean-Fran&#xe7;ois Dumon developed methods for laser photoresection and for placing stents thorough the bronchoscope. More recently, application of endobronchial ultrasound and electromagnetic navigation tools has further galvanized the role of bronchoscopy. The success of lung transplantation also belongs in part to flexible bronchoscopy. Today, researchers are looking into treating emphysema as well as asthma, using bronchoscopic techniques. We believe 2015 is a good time to look back on the history of bronchoscopy and to recognize its major milestones. This article attempts to connect the historical dots in this field of research, with the hope that our effort helps future generations improve the welfare of patients with lung ailments."

For this reason, technology improvements in both of the two major ENB systems have been introduced to improve yield and performance. 8,10,112 The ENB-VM system includes sensory tracking tips built into biopsy instruments to allow real-time tracking of biopsy tools. It has also introduced upgrades to its thoracic navigation system to track moving targets during respiration. In addition, the ENB-VM system includes the ability to switch to navigated TTNA in the same procedure as navigated bronchoscopy, as well as simultaneous navigation with radial Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS). The ENB-SD system has introduced seven upgrades to the operating system or software since 2004, including a /uniFB01 ducial marker guidance system. 113 The ENB-SD system also has a transbronchial access tool to reach lesions outside the bronchial airways. 65,114 The newest version of the ENB-SD system adds software algorithms to enhance the visibility of the target region with three-dimensional /uniFB02 uoroscopy and to compensate for CT-to-body divergence (Fig 9).
