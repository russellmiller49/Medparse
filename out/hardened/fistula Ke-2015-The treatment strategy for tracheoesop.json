TEF is identified by an abnormal connection (fistula) between the esophagus and trachea and is the most common type of airway fistula. Typical symptoms in case of TEF are choking following food intake, severe coughing, feeding disorders, and unmanageable pneumonia (1,3). The quality of life of patients with TEF is poor. Moreover, the life expectancy of the patients without proper treatment may be measured in weeks. Esophageal malignancy is the main cause of TEF (4,5), with tumor invasion through the wall of the esophagus and trachea leading to formation of a fistula. TEF usually develops during or after completing radiation and chemotherapy with subsequent tumor necrosis (6) ( Figure 1 ). In addition, the persistent pressure to the wall of esophagus and airway after esophageal stenting is also an important cause (7) ( Figure 2 ).",

The stent should cover beyond proximal and distal fistula margins, and be wide enough to press firmly against the esophageal wall. Basically, the guidance techniques of esophageal stenting using endoscopic or radiologic approach are simple. In general, most patients can benefit from esophageal stenting and resume their diet after the operation (16,17).

The stent should cover at least 20 mm beyond the lesion, and even cover more than 20 mm of proximal and distal margins of the fistula for large orifice. The stent diameter depends on the internal diameter (average of across and vertical diameter) of the normal airway. The stent should be 10-20% larger in diameter than the internal airway adjacent to fistula orifice.

Therefore, it's essential to perform maintenance bronchoscopy when indicated. Timely elimination of secretions, repositioning the stent after migration, and treating granulation tissue with forceps, laser, or cryotherapy are effective measures to improve complicated conditions. As most of fistula orifices cannot be closed completely, stent replacement and maintenance is sometimes necessary for sealing the fistulae orifice.

        "abstract": "Tracheoesophageal fistula is an uncommon clinical problem, and can be either congenital or acquired in origin. In this report, we present our experience in the management of 41 patients with tracheoesophageal fistula (28 male, 13 female; age ranging from 8 to 69 years) who were seen during the period spanning 1968 to 1989 at the National Research Center of Surgery, Moscow. During this time frame fewer malignant and correspondingly more posttraumatic and postoperative fistulas were observed. The most common clinical findings were cough associated with eating, production of sputum mixed with food, and weight loss with profound weakness. In the vast majority of patients, diagnosis was made using radiologic contrast studies, with endoscopic assessment being occasionally necessary. We classify our surgical approaches as \"radical\" (the isolation and ablation of the communication), \"conditionally radical\" (implying creation of a neoesophagus or thoracoplasty with muscle flap obliteration of the fistula and associated chronic empyema cavity), or \"palliative\" (usually entailing gastrostomy alone). Of the 32 patients undergoing surgical treatment in this series, 21 underwent radical or conditionally radical procedures; there was no operative mortality, and long-term follow-up shows that 19 of the 20 long-term survivors report satisfactory, good, or excellent status. This report summarizes the indications, timing, technique, and results of the various surgical approaches, and also delineates measures for the prevention of postoperative tracheoesophageal fistula."

Life expectancy is measured in months after successful treatment, and in days to weeks with a persistent fistula. To stop repeated episodes of aspiration and septic pneumonia, single or double stenting of the esophagus and trachea with self-expandable coated stents is the established palliative treatment. The indications, techniques, and pitfalls of esophageal and tracheal stenting are described. Surgical interventions are justified only in very select cases, so this article focuses on interventional rather than surgical treatment."

        "abstract": "The development of a malignant esophagorespiratory fistula is a devastating complication. Data comparing various treatment options in a large group of patients are sparse. To assess the results of therapy, we reviewed our experience in 207 patients with malignant esophagorespiratory fistula. Records of 207 patients admitted to our institution with malignant esophagorespiratory fistula from 1926 to 1988 were reviewed and results of management analyzed. Age ranged from 21 to 90 years (median, 59 years); the male/female ratio was 3:1. Primary tumor site was esophagus in 161 (77%), lung in 33 (16%), trachea in 5 (2%), metastatic nodes in 4 (2%), larynx in 3 (1%), and thyroid in 1. Symptoms and signs of malignant esophagorespiratory fistula included cough in 116 (56%), aspiration in 77 (37%), fever in 52 (25%), dysphagia in 39 (19%), pneumonia in 11 (5%), hemoptysis in 10 (5%), and chest pain in 10 (5%). Respiratory location of fistula included trachea in 110 (53%), left main bronchus in 46 (22%), right bronchus in 33 (16%), lung parenchyma in 13 (6%), and multiple sites in 5 (2%). The percentage of patients alive at 3, 6, and 12 months by treatment modality was 13%, 4%, and 1% for supportive care (n = 104); 17%, 3%, and 0% for esophageal exclusion (n = 29); 21%, 14%, and 0% for esophageal intubation (n = 14); 30%, 15%, and 5% for radiation therapy (n = 20); and 46%, 20%, and 7% for esophageal bypass, respectively. Patients treated with radiation therapy and esophageal bypass had a significantly prolonged survival compared with patients treated with the other modalities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

        "abstract": "Acquired, nonmalignant tracheoesophageal fistula is an uncommon and difficult problem to manage. The most common cause is a complication of endotracheal or tracheostomy tubes. Most are diagnosed while patients still require mechanical ventilation. We use a conservative approach until patients are weaned from ventilation. A tracheostomy tube is placed so that the balloon rests below the fistula, if possible, to prevent contamination of the tracheobronchial tree. A gastrostomy tube is placed for drainage and a separate jejunostomy tube for nutrition. Single-stage repair is done after the patient is weaned from mechanical ventilation. Esophageal diversion is rarely required. We have performed 41 operations on 38 patients. Simple division and closure of the fistula was done in 9 patients and tracheal resection and reconstruction in the remainder. The esophageal defect was closed in two layers and a viable strap muscle interposed between the two suture lines. There were four deaths (10.9%). There were three recurrent fistulas and one delayed tracheal stenosis. All were successfully managed. Of the 34 surviving patients, 33 aliment themselves orally and 32 breathe without the need for a tracheal appliance."

Once an esophagotracheal fistula has developed, the overall condition of the patient declines rapidly. Aspiration pneumonia and severe coughing are common. The introduction of esophageal tubes does not always seal the fistula sufficiently and may compromise the airway causing stridor and dyspnea. In 30 patients (25 male, 5 female; age 23 to 74 years; mean, 56 years) with very large fistulas and airway problems, we inserted an airway stent (Dynamic) (n = 12) or an esophageal tube combined with a Dynamic airway stent (n = 18) with the aim of sealing the fistula and restoring patency of the airway and GI passage. The tracheobronchial Dynamic stent was chosen because its slightly concave, flexible posterior silicone membrane adapts ideally to the convex esophageal tube. The stents were well tolerated and significantly improved the quality of life. Of 30 patients, 16 could breathe and swallow unimpaired until shortly before their death. Moderate complaints persisted in five patients, dysphagia in eight patients, and dyspnea in one patient. Mean survival time in the double stent group was significantly greater (110 days) than in the airway stent-only group (24 days) or comparable groups in the literature treated with esophageal tubes only. We conclude that carefully selected patients can benefit from double stenting of esophagus and airways."

Tolerance was excellent and complications were rare. Migration occurred 12 times: in seven cases an early prototype that was poorly designed had been used. Obstruction was noted in two cases without major problems. Mean follow-up at the time of this writing is three months, with the longest follow-up 19 months."
