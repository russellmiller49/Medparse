The modern PDT procedure has also evolved to whereby it can be safely performed by surgeons and nonsurgeons in the ICU. Moreover, bedside PDT has proven clinical outcomes and can save hospital resources. As such, PDT done in the ICU is now a widely performed procedure, often being the tracheostomy procedure of choice. Today, many pulmonologists and intensivists who can use bedside PDT do not perform this procedure; it is conceivable this practice may expand, especially among pulmonologists and intensivists. Although numerous indications exist for tracheostomy, the focus of this article is limited to bedside PDT for prolonged mechanical ventilation, which is the most common indication for this procedure.

PDT still has limitations and risks, including possibly a higher incidence of decannulation and obstruction. Furthermore, some investigators have proposed a learning curve for PDT, noting possible increased complications in patients operated on by inexperienced operators or in institutions where the procedure is performed infrequently. 14 Therefore, early experience with PDT is recommended under controlled settings. Notably, the American College of Surgeons still recommends bedside PDT as the procedure of choice, even in high-risk patients. 11"

In our institution, the team would include the operating physician, an airway assistant (typically another physician or advanced care practitioner), a bedside nurse, and a respiratory therapist at a minimum. We also have a second assistant across the bed from the operator, usually a resident or fellow in training, but in other centers this person may include an operating room technician or physician assistant. In some institutions, an anesthesiologist may serve to assist the sedation and airway strategies, especially if skilled respiratory therapy support is not available. It is critical that the airway assistant and the respiratory therapist are familiar with each step of the procedure as to not prematurely remove the endotracheal tube prior to con /uniFB01 rmation of the tracheostomy. During the procedure, the airway will intermittently become partially compromised with the dilator and insertion of the tracheostomy tube. This action will result in frequent ventilator alarm triggering that requires diligent monitoring by a respiratory therapist to ensure the airway is not truly lost; this is especially concerning in patients with higher oxygenation and/or positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) requirements (eg, FIO 2 > 0.6 and/or PEEP > 12 cm H2O). The bedside nurse monitors the patient and vital signs and, in cases in which the procedure is performed under moderate sedation, the nurse might be asked to administer sedation and analgesia.

The PDT team is assembled at the bedside with a commercially available PDT tray. Some kits are allinclusive packages with chlorhexidine-based preparation, full-body drapes, syringes, dilator, lidocaine with 1/ 100,000 epinephrine, suture, needle driver/hemostat, and 8.0-mm cuffed regular tracheostomy tube.

A /uniFB02 exible bronchoscope with video monitor is positioned in sight of the operator close to the bed.

        "abstract": "The development by the senior author (P.C.) of percutaneous tracheostomy from cricothyroidostomy and subcricoid fingertip tracheostomy is traced, and the technique and patient material of percutaneous subcricoid tracheostomy is presented. This new technique consists of inserting a tracheostomy tube by the use of a J guide wire inserted through a cannula into the tracheal lumen. Tapered dilators follow the guide wire and dilate the opening in the tracheal walls. A tracheostomy tube snugly fitted over a dilator is then passed into the trachea between the cricoid cartilage and the first tracheal ring. This procedure avoids the immediate and postoperative complications of \"standard\" tracheostomy. An experience of 134 tracheostomies of various types culminated in the development of the percutaneous technique. To date 26 such operations on 24 patients have been done with no significant complications due to the operation. The percutaneous technique should reduce the severity and incidence of intraoperative complications. Late complications, which have been no problem to date, are being evaluated with longer follow-up and with a greater patient population."

Percutaneous dilational tracheostomy techniques have allowed bedside tracheostomy placement in the modern intensive care unit. Percutaneous dilational tracheostomy can be safely performed by interventional pulmonologists, medical intensive care physicians, and surgical specialists. When performed with the assistance of adjuncts, such as flexible bronchoscopy, the percutaneous dilational method has a favorable complication rate, efficiency, and cost profile compared with surgical tracheostomy."

Tracheostomy is performed for upper airway obstruction, though more often to allow prolonged mechanical ventilation in place of endotracheal tubes. Preparation, performance, and postoperative management for PDT are best provided by a multidisciplinary team. Although PDT is a safe procedure in the hands of experienced operators, both early and late complications can arise. Caution must also be taken during early tracheostomy tube exchange given that immaturity of the stomal tract can risk loss of the airway."

The diversity and application of these procedures in patients with more complex conditions is leading to the need for more specific recommendations in training within this area. As patient safety and outcomes-based measures of clinical practice and procedures are in the forefront, the need for standardization in procedural training in high-volume centers of excellence beyond pulmonary and critical care fellowships must be considered. Other procedure-based specialties have developed such training programs, with structured curricula to enhance patient safety and outcomes, develop validated metrics for competency assessment of trainees, improve trainee education, and further advance the field by fostering research."

Due to its invasive and physiologically critical nature, tracheostomy placement can be associated with significant morbidity and even mortality. This article provides a comprehensive overview of commonly encountered complications that may occur during and after the tracheal airway placement, including both short- and long-term postoperative morbidity."

        "abstract": "Tracheostomy is a common surgical procedure, and is increasingly performed in the intensive care unit (ICU) as opposed to the operating room. Procedural knowledge is essential and is therefore outlined in this review. We also review several high-quality studies comparing percutaneous dilational tracheostomy and open surgical tracheostomy. The percutaneous method has a comparable, if not superior, safety profile and lower cost compared with the open surgical approach; therefore the percutaneous method is increasingly chosen. Studies comparing early versus late tracheostomy suggest morbidity benefits that include less nosocomial pneumonia, shorter mechanical ventilation and shorter stay in the ICU. However, we discuss the questions that remain regarding the optimal timing of tracheostomy. We outline the potential acute and chronic complications of tracheostomy and their management, and we review the different tracheostomy tubes, their indications and when to remove them."

For inexperienced operators, especially nonsurgeons, we recommend avoiding such cases. We do note that with increasing experience, PDT can be performed safely in select patients who are morbidly obese, 15 have short, fat necks, 16 with coagulopathy, 17 have neck or cervical trauma, 18 and even those with high oxygen requirements. 19 These latter conditions require increased operator and team experience in PDT prior to performance; in some centers, these may be best accomplished via an open surgical approach. Therefore, in deciding between percutaneous and open surgical approaches, relevant factors may also include skills of the operating team,"

PDT still has limitations and risks, including possibly a higher incidence of decannulation and obstruction. Furthermore, some investigators have proposed a learning curve for PDT, noting possible increased complications in patients operated on by inexperienced operators or in institutions where the procedure is performed infrequently. 14 Therefore, early experience with PDT is recommended under controlled settings. Notably, the American College of Surgeons still recommends bedside PDT as the procedure of choice, even in high-risk patients. 11",
