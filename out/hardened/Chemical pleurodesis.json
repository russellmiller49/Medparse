    "abstract": "Chemical pleurodesis is a therapeutic procedure applied to create the symphysis between the parietal and visceral pleura by intrapleural administration of various chemical agents (e.g. talk, tetracycline, iodopovidone, etc.). The two major clinical conditions treated with chemical pleurodesis are recurrent pleural effusion (PE) and recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax. Although the history of chemical pleurodesis began over a century ago, detailed data on the mechanisms of action of sclerosing agents are highly incomplete. The following article aims to present the state of knowledge on this subject. It is believed that mesothelial cells are the main structural axis of pleurodesis. In response to sclerosing agents they secrete a variety of mediators including chemokines such as interleukin 8 (IL-8) and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1), as well as growth factors - vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and transforming growth factorβ (TGFβ ). Numerous data suggest that intact mesothelial cells and the above cytokines play a crucial role in the initiation and maintenance of different pathways of pleural inflammation and pleural space obliteration. It seems that the process of pleurodesis is largely nonspecific to the sclerosant and involves the same ultimate pathways including activation of pleural cells, coagulation cascade, fibrin chain formation, fibroblast proliferation and production of collagen and extracellular matrix components. Of these processes, the coagulation cascade with decreased fibrinolytic activity and increased fibrinogenesis probably plays a pivotal role, at least during the early response to sclerosant administration. A better understanding of various pathways involved in pleurodesis may be a prerequisite for more effective and safe use of various sclerosants and for the development of new, perhaps more personalized therapeutic approaches",

As the vast majority of these agents are chemicals, the term ' chemical pleurodesis ' is commonly used.

In patients with recurrent pleural effusion, pleurodesis is a symptomatic treatment that prevents dyspnea related to relatively rapid reaccumulation of pleural fluid after its earlier withdrawal. Thus, the beneficial effect of pleurodesis in patients with pleural effusion can be observed within weeks or months after the procedure. In recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax, pleurodesis has a more delayed effect (months, years), as it is not applied to treat the current pneumothorax episode, but it is aimed to prevent future pneumothorax recurrences."

Though it mainly refers to malignant pleural effusion (MPE), chemical pleurodesis can also be applied in patients with other underlying diseases. In developed countries, MPE is probably the third leading cause of pleural effusion, with approximately 200,000 new cases diagnosed each year in the United States [1]. Almost 75% of all MPEs are associated with three common malignancies: lung cancer, breast cancer and lymphoma. According to literature data as many as 30% of lung cancer patients and 7 -11% of breast cancer patients develop pleural effusion [2]. Furthermore, it is estimated that malignant pleural effusion may occur in nearly 50% of all patients with metastatic cancers [3]. Since MPE usually reflects advanced (metastatic) disease, curative treatment is only occasionally possible and effective. Thus, although chemical pleurodesis is a palliative treatment that should be applied only in patients who cannot be offered effective causative treatment, or in those in whom causal treatment was found to be ineffective, the number of patients who require symptomatic treatment due to dyspnea related to MPE is substantial. The number of pleurodeses performed in the United States approximates 100,000 per year [4]. The treatment strategy in patients with symptomatic MPE is complex but pleural interventions play a pivotal role. The choice of therapeutic procedure should be based on several determinants, including life expectancy and patient preferences [5]. In terms of prognosis in patients with MPE the first validated prognostic scores to predict survival in patients with MPE has been developed in recent years, and they seems to be very helpful in selecting patients who might benefit from pleurodesis [6, 7]. Large volume therapeutic thoracentesis may bring an immediate therapeutic effect but it does not prevent pleural fluid reaccumulation. Therefore, repeated therapeutic thoracenteses might be recommended only for patients with a slow rate of pleural fluid reaccumulation (> 1 month), patients with a short-expected survival time (< 3 months) [8], and some patients who will undergo chemotherapy or targeted therapy which is expected to be"

In the remaining patients, procedures that reduce the future risk of pleural effusion recurrence should be considered, with chemical pleurodesis being the major therapeutic option. It must be emphasized, however, that not all patients with recurrent malignant pleural effusion are suitable candidates for chemical pleurodesis. The two major contraindications to the procedure are an unexpandable lung ( ' trapped lung ' ) and inability to remove pleural fluid, e.g. due to multiple loculations. This is because the formation of effective pleural adhesions after administration of sclerosing agent requires a close and direct contact between the parietal and visceral pleura. Thus, an effective withdrawal of pleural effusion and the ability of the lung to reexpand are important prerequisites for efficient pleurodesis. The overall effectiveness of chemical pleurodesis in prevention of reaccumulation of MPE ranges between 41.3 and 100% and depends on different factors, including cancer type, extension of pleural involvement and the sclerosant used for pleurodesis [9 -11]. Another increasingly popular therapeutic option that might also be offered to patients with unexpandable lung is chest tube insertion to permanently drain the pleural fluid (indwelling or tunneled pleural catheter, IPC). Pleuroperitoneal [12] or pleuro-venal [13, 14] shunts are hardly ever used anymore, because of the invasive character of the procedure and the high complication rate. With IPC, symptomatic relief can be achieved in 70 -94.2% patients with MPE [15, 16]. Moreover, it has been shown that drainage of the pleural cavity may lead to spontaneous pleurodesis [17]."

This number seems to be consistent with the data from earlier studies [19 -21]. Most authors agree that pleurodesis should be offered to patients with the first recurrence (i.e. the second episode) of spontaneous pneumothorax. However, the definitive treatment aimed to prevent recurrence of pneumothorax is not limited to chemical pleurodesis, but also includes other therapeutic options [22, 23]. Bearing in mind the above considerations, it is easy to understand that the number of patients with spontaneous pneumothorax who are treated with chemical pleurodesis might be lower than the respective number of patients with pleural effusion.

However, the results of intrapleural instillation of a hypertonic glucose solution were unsatisfactory. Thus, as early as in 1906, the same author suggested the use of 0.5% silver nitrate solution instead of hypertonic glucose [24, 25]. In 1935, Norman Bethune proposed intrapleural application of iodized talc to create pleural adhesions in patients with bronchiectasis prior to lobectomy [26].

Studies on animal models of talc and doxycycline pleurodesis demonstrated a significantly increased risk of pleurodesis failure during corticosteroid therapy [57, 58]. The same effect of corticosteroids was found for iodopovidone pleurodesis [52]. Interestingly, this phenomenon was not observed in the animal model when TGFβ was used as a sclerosing agent [59]. This raised hope for the future possibility to perform pleurodesis with selected cytokines with no side effects associated with inflammation and without a significant risk of pleurodesis failure in patients receiving anti-inflammatory therapies. However, there still have been no adequate clinical trials with TGFβ and therefore the use of this cytokine cannot be recommended for routine clinical practice."

The pleural effects of this cytokine were investigated in pleural fibrosis (fibrothorax) complicating pleural empyema [90]. It was demonstrated that HGF can cause opposite effects to those elicited by TGFβ and bFGF. Namely, it prevented adhesion formation and promoted the regeneration of the mesothelium cell layer. Several studies showed that antiHGF antibodies induce fibrosis by neutralizing endogenous HGF. This phenomenon has been observed in animal models in the kidneys [91], liver [92] and lung diseases [93]. To our knowledge, there have been no studies either on the effect of pleurodesis on HGF activity or potentially profibrogenic effects of anti-HGF antibodies in the pleural cavity. However, it can be hypothesized that inhibition of HGF might enhance pleural fibrogenesis initiated by the sclerosing agent. This hypothesis should be tested in future studies. When discussing HGF in the context of MPE, it should be mentioned that one Japanese study showed an anti-tumor effect of anti-HGF and NK4 (a HGF fragment -competitive inhibitor of HGF-Met receptor) on malignant pleural mesothelioma [94]."

Endogenous MMP inhibitors are a family of glycoproteins that is referred to as tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP). In the pleural cavity, TIMP1 is secreted by mononuclear phagocytes [72]. Traditionally the role of MMPs and TIMPs was limited to remodeling of matrix components. Recent data suggest that their role is far more complex and includes intracellular and extracellular signaling [95]. Besides their enzymatic properties, the physiological functions of MMPs include wound healing, angiogenesis, organ morphogenesis and modulation of inflammatory processes. MMP9 activates IL-8 and inactivates IL-1 β and is rapidly expressed as an early response to injury, persists during healing and declines upon reepithelialization [96]."

To date, management has been palliative in nature with a focus on draining the pleural space, with therapies aimed at preventing recurrence or providing intermittent drainage through indwelling catheters. Given that patients with MPEs are heterogeneous with respect to their cancer type and response to systemic therapy, functional status, and pleural milieu, response to MPE therapy is also heterogeneous and difficult to predict. Furthermore, the impact of therapies on important patient outcomes has only recently been evaluated consistently in clinical trials and cohort studies. In this review, we examine patient outcomes that have been studied to date, address the question of which are most important for managing patients, and review the literature related to the expected value for money (cost-effectiveness) of indwelling pleural catheters relative to traditionally recommended approaches."

        "abstract": "Malignant pleural effusion is a common and debilitating complication of advanced malignant diseases. This problem seems to affect particularly those with lung and breast cancer, contributing to the poor quality of life. Approximately half of all patients with metastatic cancer develop a malignant pleural effusion at some point, which is likely to cause significant symptoms such as dyspnea and cough. Evacuation of the pleural fluid and prevention of its re-accumulation are the main goals of management. Optimal treatment is controversial and there is no universally standard approach. Intervention options range from observation in the case of asymptomatic effusions through simple thoracentesis to more invasive methods such as chemical and mechanical pleurodesis, pleur-X catheter drainage, pleuroperitoneal shunting, and pleurectomy. The best results are reported with thoracoscopy and talc insufflation, with an acceptable morbidity. Development of novel methods to control malignant pleural effusion should be a high priority in palliative care of cancer patients. This article reviews the current, as well as, novel approaches that show some promise for the future. The aim is to identify the proper approach for each individual patient."

        "abstract": "Numerous intrapleural therapies have been adopted to treat a vast array of pleural diseases. The first intrapleural therapies proposed focused on the use of fibrinolytics and DNase to promote fluid drainage in empyema. Numerous case series and five randomized controlled trials have been published to determine the outcomes of fibrinolytics in empyema treatment. In the largest randomized trial, the use of streptokinase had no reduction in mortality, decortication rates or hospital days compared with placebo in the treatment of empyema. Criticism over study design and patient selection may have potentially affected the outcomes in this study. The development of dyspnoea is common in the setting of malignant pleural effusions. Pleural fluid evacuation followed by pleurodesis is often attempted. Numerous sclerosing agents have been studied, with talc emerging as the most effective agent. Small particle size of talc should be avoided because of increased systemic absorption potentiating toxicity, such as acute lung injury. Over the past several years, the use of chronic indwelling pleural catheters have emerged as the preferred modality in the treating a symptomatic malignant pleural effusion. For patients with malignant-related lung entrapment, pleurodesis often fails due to the presence of visceral pleural restriction; however, chronic indwelling pleural catheters are effective in palliation of dyspnoea. Finally, the use of staphylococcal superantigens has been proposed as a therapeutic model for the treatment of non-small lung cancer. Intrapleural instillation of staphylococcal superantigens increased median survival by 5 months in patients with non-small cell lung cancer with a malignant pleural effusion."

Intravenous hyperalimentation, repeated pleurodesis, and ligation of the thoracic duct were all ineffective. A pleuroperitoneal shunt was inserted into the right pleural cavity from the fifth intercostal space, and a peritoneal catheter was placed in the abdominal cavity. Chylothorax was markedly improved, and the quality of life of the patient increased. This case indicates that a pleuroperitoneal shunt can be used for lung cancer-related chylothorax, as well as for malignant pleural effusion."

        "abstract": "Management of recurrent malignant pleural effusion associated with trapped lung syndrome remains problematic. An alternative treatment using a pleural catheter has been advocated. Between August 1999 and August 2002, 127 patients underwent thoracoscopy for malignant pleural effusion. Of these, 52 (41%) with trapped lung were managed by insertion of a pleural catheter. Mean age was 66 years (range, 42-89 years). The most frequent diagnosis was breast cancer. Spontaneous pleurodesis (drainage &lt; 10 mL) occurred in 25 (48%) patients whose catheter was removed after 30 to 255 days (mean, 93.8 days). Symptomatic relief was achieved in 49 (94%) patients. Mean dyspnea score improved significantly from 3.0 to 1.9. Complications comprised catheter blockage, surgical emphysema, cellulitis, and loculated effusion in 2 patients each. Mean length of hospital stay was 3 days (range, 1-16 days). Median survival was 126 days (range, 10-175 days). We conclude that long-term placement of a pleural catheter provides effective palliation for malignant pleural effusion associated with trapped lung syndrome."

        "abstract": "Malignant pleural effusions (MPE) are frequent consequences of malignant disease and significantly impair the quality of life (QoL) of patients. There are two main options for the palliation of MPE-related symptoms: obliterating the pleural space by pleurodesis to prevent further fluid reaccumulation, or chronically draining the pleural fluid with an indwelling pleural catheter (IPC). There is controversy as to which approach is superior each having advantages and drawbacks. Pleurodesis offers a higher chance of rapid resolution of the pleural effusion with an intervention that is time limited but at the expense of a more invasive procedure, the need for a hospital stay and a higher need for repeat procedures. IPC offers an outpatient solution which is less invasive but at the cost of prolonged catheter drainages and care in a significant portion of patients who will not achieve pleurodesis. Impact on QoL, symptom relief and costs do not appear to be significantly different between the two options. Treatment of MPE should be tailored to the patient's functional status, comorbidities, prognosis and personal preferences as well as local expertise. Hybrid approaches using pleurodesis techniques and IPC concomitantly may come into play in the near future to further improve patient care."

The study group consisted of a consecutive series of 138 patients admitted to Huddinge University Hospital over ten years for treatment of their first spontaneous pneumothorax. Their smoking habits were routinely analyzed. The sample consisted of 15,204 persons domiciled in the same circumscribed area (County of Stockholm). The annual incidence of first SP in the admission area is 6/100,000 for women and 18/100,000 for men. The study showed that smoking increased the relative risk of contracting a first spontaneous pneumothorax approximately ninefold among women and 22-fold among men and that there is a striking, statistically significant (p less than 0.001) dose-response relationship between smoking and the occurrence of SP. The life span risk of contracting SP among lifelong heavily smoking men is roughly estimated to be 12 percent but only 1/1,000 among never smokers."

In this article we discuss the likely mechanisms of pleural inflammation and pleurodesis with emphasis on the systemic response due to the instillation of talc into the pleural space."

According to current practice guidelines, chemical pleurodesis is reserved for patients who are unable or unwilling to have surgery. Some recent studies showed that intrapleural minocycline pleurodesis could decrease the rate of pneumothorax recurrence, when used either as the initial treatment for simple pneumothorax after successful aspiration and drainage or as an adjuvant treatment for complicated or recurrent pneumothorax following thoracoscopic surgery. The purpose of this review is to discuss the current available evidence on intrapleural minocycline pleurodesis for the treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax."

To evaluate the mechanisms, pleural fluid pH, leukocytes, granulocytes, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and serum IL-6, as well as C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured before and on 2 consecutive days after treatment. Corynebacterium parvum produced a greater acute-phase response measured with fever, serum CRP and IL-6 than doxycycline. However, no change in pleural fluid IL-6 was demonstrated. Among the 35 assessed patients, 26 had objective response, similar in all four treatment groups. Side-effects were more common with Corynebacterium parvum. Based on this preliminary study we conclude that doxycycline, even in low doses, is a highly effective and well tolerated agent for palliative treatment of malignant pleural effusion. As the responses were similar despite different inflammatory reactions, the two agents probably induce pleural obliteration through different mechanisms."

        "abstract": "A prospective randomized study to compare the effectiveness of pleurodesis by two new sclerosing agents: OK-432 and mitomycin C were conducted in 53 patients with malignant pleural effusion caused by lung cancer. None of the patients received concomitant systemic chemotherapy or radiation therapy during the study. After complete drainage of pleural fluid, the patients were allocated randomly to receive 10 Klinische Einheit units of OK-432 or 8 mg of mitomycin C by intrapleural injection at weekly intervals. The treatment was terminated if the pleural effusion disappeared or the patients had received four consecutive procedures. There were 26 patients who received pleurodesis with OK-432 and 27, with mitomycin C. Patient characteristics in the two treatment groups (age, sex, histologic type, performance status, and prior treatment before pleurodesis) were compatible. These results showed that pleurodesis with OK-432 achieved a higher complete response rate (73%) than that of mitomycin C (41%). The rates of objective treatment response (complete response plus partial response) were comparable in both groups (88% for OK-432 and 67% for mitomycin C). The average number of intrapleural injections needed to achieve complete response was fewer in the OK-432 group (1.9 +/- 0.9) than in mitomycin C group (2.8 +/- 0.9). There was no significant difference in the median survival of the patients who received pleurodesis with OK-432 (5.8 months) or mitomycin C (5.1 months). However, the effusion-free period in the OK-432 group was significantly longer than that in the mitomycin C group (7.0 months versus 1.5 months). Patients who underwent OK-432 pleurodesis had a higher complication rate (80%) than did those in the mitomycin C group (30%). Transient febrile reaction was the most common reaction encountered. The immunologic study in OK-432 group showed an increase in peripheral leukocyte count and decrease in the OKT4/OKT8 ratio. The mitomycin C group had a mild reduction in peripheral blood leukocyte count and no significant change in the OKT4/OKT8 ratio. It was concluded that pleurodesis with OK-432 is an effective alternative treatment for malignant effusion in patients with lung cancer."

        "abstract": "A randomized phase III trial of bleomycin, tetracycline and talc following chest tube drainage and a meta-analysis of relative benefit of bleomycin and tetracycline as sclerosing agents were performed to determine the optimal approach to malignant pleural effusion (MPE). Fifty patients were randomized to receive bleomycin (n=16), tetracycline (n=19) or talc (n=16) following chest tube drainage. Treatment groups were balanced for pretreatment characteristics. The study was ended prematurely because of the removal of parenteral tetracycline from the market. Overall, 52% of randomized patients had successful control of effusion 30 days after sclerosis. There were no differences between any of the three treatment groups in terms of 30 day control of effusion, overall survival (6 months), resclerosis rate, pain with sclerosis, fever, or duration of hospitalization (6 days). A meta-analysis was performed using the four previously reported trials of tetracycline vs. bleomycin and revealed a 20.6% advantage to the use of bleomycin (95% C.I. 7.9%-33.3%) (p=0.002). This phase III failed to demonstrate a significant difference between the three agents in terms of control of MPE at 30 days, side effects or survival. However, because of small sample size, this study lacks sufficient power to observe potentially clinically important differences between treatment groups. Inclusion of data from four previous trials in a meta-analysis showed that bleomycin may be superior. The median duration of hospitalization and the overall success rate of all three sclerosing agents in this study argue convincingly that new approaches to palliate MPE are needed."

        "abstract": "We have previously shown that the intrapleural injection of mitozantrone but not bleomycin resulted in pleural fibrosis. Mechlorethamine hydrochloride (nitrogen mustard) was used extensively in the past to control malignant effusions, with relatively good success. The objective of this study was to determine if the intrapleural injection of nitrogen mustard would produce pleural sclerosis in our experimental model in rabbits. We therefore evaluated sclerosing capabilities of nitrogen mustard as well as those of cytarabine and dacarbazine. Nitrogen mustard (0.4 and 0.8 mg x kg(-1)), cytarabine (3, 6 and 20 mg x kg(-1)) and dacarbazine (4, 8 and 20 mg x kg(-1)) were instilled intrapleurally into anaesthetized rabbits. Twenty eight days after the instillation, the animals were killed, and the pleural spaces were assessed grossly for evidence of pleurodesis and microscopically for evidence of fibrosis and inflammation. The intrapleural injection of 0.8 mg x kg(-1) nitrogen mustard was effective in creating pleural fibrosis, either grossly or microscopically. The mean degree (scale 0-4) of gross pleurodesis in the rabbits that received 0.8 mg x kg(-1) nitrogen mustard was 3.2+/-1.0 and the mean degree of microscopic pleural fibrosis was 3.5+/-0.8. The intrapleural injection of 0.4 mg x kg(-1) nitrogen mustard and the different doses of cytarabine (3, 6 and 20 mg x kg(-1)) and dacarbazine (4, 8 and 20 mg x kg(-1)) were ineffective in producing pleurodesis. From this study, we conclude that the intrapleural injection of 0.8 mg x kg(-1) of nitrogen mustard produces clinically significant pleurodesis in rabbits. Consideration should be given to future clinical studies utilizing 0.6-0.8 mg x kg(-1) nitrogen mustard intrapleurally for the treatment of malignant pleural effusion."

The efficacy of pleurodesis using both OK-432, a preparation of Streptococcus pyogenes, and doxorubicin for 20 patients with cytology-proven malignant pleural effusion associated with lung cancer was evaluated. After complete removal of pleural effusion, OK-432 and 30 mg of doxorubicin were injected via an inserted chest tube. Treatment was terminated when the volume of daily drainage reached &lt;200 mL. If the daily volume remained &gt;200 mL, an additional OK-432 was administered every 3 days. In total, 16 patients (80%) revealed a complete response, two patients (10%) revealed a partial response, and no response was seen in two patients. Eighteen patients with complete or partial responses did not show subsequent reaccumulation of pleural effusion after pleurodesis. The chest tube remained in place for an average of 6.4 days, draining a mean of 2,854 mL. The main side-effects were fever and pain that were easily treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Pleurodesis using both OK-432 and doxorubicin showed high efficacy for controlling malignant pleural effusions caused by lung cancer."

Etoposide concentrations in plasma and pleural cavity fluid were measured by a reverse-phase HPLC system with a C18-reverse phase column, a mobile phase of methanol: H2O (55:45) pumped at 1.2 ml/min, and detection by absorbance at 254 nm. Pleurodesis was successfully accomplished by this maneuver and there were no adverse clinical consequences. Absorption of etoposide from the pleural cavity was slow (approximately 0.2 ml/min). The pleural cavity exposure to etoposide, as measured by the area under the curve, was 46 times greater than if a similar dose had been given IV. Conversely, systemic exposure to etoposide, as assessed by plasma AUC, was less than 50% that associated with IV injection of a similar dose."

Single intrapleural injections of TGF-beta(2) at doses of 5.00 microg (n = 12), 1.67 microg (n = 10), 0.50 microg (n = 10), or 0.167 microg (n = 4), or of the parenteral buffer alone (n = 5) were given in a volume of 2 ml to New Zealand white rabbits. Chest tubes were left in place for at least 72 h. Pleural fluid was aspirated at 24-h intervals and was measured and subjected to chemical analysis. The animals were killed 14 d after the injection. The intrapleural injection of TGF-beta(2) resulted in a dose-dependent pleurodesis (on a scale of 0 to 4, where 0 = no pleurodesis and 4 = complete pleurodesis) with mean scores of 3.6, 2.6, 1.5, 0.7, and 0.3 for the groups that received 5.0, 1.67, 0.50, and 0.167 microg of TGF-beta(2) and buffer alone, respectively. Intrapleural injection of the larger doses of TGF-beta(2) resulted in the formation of a large amount of pleural fluid. The fluid had a significantly lower white blood cell (WBC) count and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level than did the fluid that results from the intrapleural injection of 10 mg/kg doxycycline or 400 mg/kg talc slurry. On the basis of this study we conclude that a single intrapleural injection of TGF-beta(2) induces pleurodesis in a dose-dependent manner. A dose of 5.0 microg produced satisfactory pleurodesis in almost all of the rabbits so treated. Larger doses of TGF-beta(2) induced larger pleural effusions with relatively low pleural fluid WBC counts and LDH levels. The ability of TGF-beta to produce a pleurodesis in patients with recurrent pleural effusions or pneumothorax should be investigated. A single intrapleural injection of TGF-beta(2) may produce a pleurodesis both safely and painlessly."

The method was aspiration of all intrapleural fluid except a small portion left for dilution, and then injection of 7 mg of a preparation of Corynebacterium parvum suspended in 20 ml of normal saline solution. The treatment was repeated in each case as clinical conditions called for further thoracocentesis. In eight of these 10 patients the treatment resulted in prompt reduction of the rate of accumulation of pleural fluid and a striking change of cell sediment composition, with appreciable reduction in or complete disappearance of malignant cells and a rise in lymphocyte and neutrophil polymorph counts. The best responders were patients with primary pleural mesothelioma. Clinical improvement was evident in all responders."

Pleurodesis involves the introduction of a sclerosing agent into the pleural space. Talc is one of the most commonly used sclerosing agents in treating patients with recurrent, symptomatic malignant pleural effusions. However, the mechanisms whereby talc mediates pleural fibrosis remain unclear. We hypothesized that the intrapleural instillation of talc induces the pleural mesothelial production of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), which is responsible for pleural fibrosis."

        "abstract": "Pleurodesis aims to obliterate the pleural space by producing extensive adhesion of the visceral and parietal pleura, in order to control relapse of either pleural effusions (mostly malignant) or pneumothorax. A tight and complete apposition between the two pleural layers is a necessary condition to obtain a successful pleurodesis, but--besides this mechanical aspect--there are many biological mechanisms that appear to be common to most of the sclerosing agents currently used. Following intrapleural application of the sclerosing agent, diffuse inflammation, pleural coagulation-fibrinolysis imbalance (favoring the formation of fibrin adhesions), recruitment and subsequent proliferation of fibroblasts, and collagen production are findings in the pleural space. The pleural mesothelial lining is the primary target for the sclerosant and plays a pivotal role in the whole pleurodesis process, including the release of several mediators like interleukin-8, transforming growth factor-&#x3b2; and basic fibroblast growth factor. When the tumor burden is high, normal mesothelial cells are scarce, and consequently the response to the sclerosing agent is decreased, leading to failure of pleurodesis. Also, the type of tumor in the pleural cavity may also affect the outcome of pleurodesis (diffuse malignant mesothelioma and metastatic lung carcinomas have a poorer response). There is general agreement that talc obtains the best results, and there are also preliminary experimental studies suggesting that it can induce apoptosis in tumor cells and inhibit angiogenesis, thus contributing to a better control of the malignant pleural effusion. There is concern about complications (possibly associated with talc but other agents as well) related to systemic inflammation and possible activation of the coagulation cascade. In order to prevent extrapleural talc dissemination, large-particle talc is recommended. Although it could--to some degree--interfere with the mechanisms leading to pleurodesis and a carefully balanced clinical decision has therefore to be made, prophylactic treatment with subcutaneous heparin is recommended during hospitalization (immediately before and after the pleurodesis procedure)."

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the concurrent use of steroids at the time of talc-slurry pleurodesis would influence the development of the pleurodesis. One group of rabbits received an intrapleural injection of talc (400 mg/kg) and an intramuscular injection of triamcinolone (0.8 mg/kg) 1 d before talc instillation and weekly thereafter, whereas a control group received only talc. Ten rabbits in each group were killed at 6 h and at 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28 d after instillation. The mean volume of pleural fluid was significantly lower in the group receiving corticosteroids at 6 h through 4 d after talc slurry than in the other groups. The degree of pleural adhesion was significantly smaller in the group receiving corticosteroids from Day 2 through Day 28. At Day 28, all 10 rabbits that received talc only had a pleurodesis score of 3 or 4, whereas only four of the 10 rabbits that also received steroids had a pleurodesis score of 3 or 4. This study shows that the use of corticosteroids at the time of talc-slurry pleurodesis markedly decreases the inflammatory reaction to the talc, and essentially prevents a pleurodesis from developing."

Its major indications are malignant effusions and pneumothorax, and a re-expandable lung is essential for the success of the technique. Moreover, expectation of a reasonably long survival is important before attempting pleurodesis. A successful lung re-expansion is unlikely if the pleural pressure falls more than 20 cmH2O x L(-1) of fluid removed, because there is a central bronchial obstruction or the lung is trapped by tumour and/or fibrin. Pleural fluid pH (&lt;7.20) is a good indicator of the presence of trapped lung; moreover, a successful pleurodesis is less likely when pH is low, and this parameter is also a good predictor for survival of the patients. Among the many sclerosing agents that have been used for pleurodesis, talc has achieved the best results, with an average success rate of approximately 90%. The cellular and biochemical mechanisms involved in pleurodesis may be specific to the agent used, however, they may all follow a common final pathway leading to activation of the pleural coagulation cascade, the appearance of fibrin networks, and the proliferation of fibroblasts. The details of these mechanisms are still unclear and need to be further elaborated."

A significant tenfold increase in FGF-b (0.05&#x2009;ng/mL &#xb1; 0.02 to 0.44&#x2009;ng/mL 0.6) was seen 24&#x2009;h after talc instillation (P &lt; 0.04).

They produced significant levels of FGF-b in a dose dependent manner (P &lt; 0.005). We hypothesized that a successful pleurodesis involves an early enhanced recruitment of inflammatory cells through a rise of IL-8 followed by enrollment of fibroblasts from the submesothelial space through increased mesothelial FGF-b production."

The mechanisms by which pleurodesis is produced remain unknown but may involve either injury or activation of the mesothelium. The aim of the current study was to assess the inflammatory response of pleural mesothelial cells to talc in an experimental model in rabbits. A group of 10 rabbits were injected intrapleurally with talc (200 mg.kg(-1)) and undiluted pleural fluid was collected after 6, 24 or 48 h for measurement of interleukin (IL)-8, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1. Samples of pleura were studied to assess the inflammatory infiltrate and mesothelial cell viability. The pleural fluid IL-8 concentration peaked at 6 h, whereas VEGF and TGF-beta1 concentrations increased steadily over 48 h. Immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin showed a preserved layer of mesothelial cells despite the intense inflammatory pleural reaction. In conclusion, it is proposed that the mesothelial cell, although injured by the talc, may actively mediate the primary inflammatory pleural response in talc-induced pleurodesis."

The current authors investigated a total of 168 patients with malignant pleural effusion, who were treated with talc poudrage. According to the outcome the patients were categorised into one of two groups, either successful or failed pleurodesis. In all cases, pleural fluid neutrophils and DDs were determined on serial measurements at 0, 3, 24 and 48 h after the procedure. The time course of these parameters was assessed in both groups and the time point at which they could better predict the outcome was further explored. Neutrophils rose rapidly after talc poudrage in both groups, reaching a plateau at 24 h, although in successful pleurodesis this response was significantly higher. DD dropped markedly at 24 h in the group with the successful outcome, but it did not show significant changes in the other group. A cut-off value of 61% for neutrophils and 61 mg.L-1 for the DD at 24 h yielded the best prognosis for successful pleurodesis. The current authors conclude that serial measurements of neutrophil and d-dimer values into the pleural fluid after talc poudrage could be used as predictors of the outcome of pleurodesis."

The purpose of this project was to determine whether the pleurodesis that results from the intrapleural administration of talc or doxycycline depends on tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha). In a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study, 34 New Zealand white rabbits were given 400 mg talc or 10 mg/kg doxycycline intrapleurally as a sclerosant through a chest tube. Half the rabbits in each group were also given 2,000 units of ovine, polyclonal affinity purified anti-TNF alpha Fab, or saline as placebo immediately after and 12 h after the injection of the sclerosant. Chest tubes were aspirated at 12-h intervals until their removal at 4 days. Rabbits were killed at 28 days. The pleural fluid volume, cell counts, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and pleurodesis scores were compared among groups. Both talc and doxycycline produced an exudative pleural effusion. The pleural fluid volume and the pleural fluid LDH levels were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) greater in the group given doxycycline. The administration of anti-TNF alpha Fab had no significant effect on pleural fluid volume or leukocyte count in either group. However, the administration of anti-TNF alpha Fab resulted in a significant decrease (p = 0.004) in the pleurodesis score for the animals given talc (3.2 +/- 0.8 without Fab and 1.8 +/- 0.9 with Fab). In contrast, the pleurodesis score was virtually identical in the doxycycline group with (3.5 +/- 0.5) and without (3.4 +/- 0.7) Fab. The administration of anti-TNF alpha Fab diminishes the pleurodesis induced by talc but not that resulting from doxycycline. These findings suggest that different mechanisms are involved with the two different sclerosants."

Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta is a pro-fibrotic but anti-inflammatory cytokine. Intrapleural TGF-beta2 administration produces effective pleurodesis in animals, but its effects on mesothelial cells are unknown. The authors hypothesised that, unlike conventional pleurodesing agents, TGF-beta2 can induce collagen synthesis without stimulating pleural inflammation. In the in vitro studies, TGF-beta2, talc and doxycycline were administered to rabbit mesothelial cells for 24 h. These agents were also injected intrapleurally in rabbits and the induced pleural fluids collected at 24 h. TGF-beta2 was as potent as talc and doxycycline in upregulating mesothelial cell collagen expression. Talc and doxycycline both induced significant increases in interleukin (IL)-8 production from mesothelial cells in vitro and in rabbit pleural fluids in vivo. TGF-beta2, however, did not stimulate mesothelial cell IL-8 release in vitro and induced a dose-dependent suppression of pleural fluid IL-8. Pleural fluid IL-8 levels correlated significantly with leukocyte and lactate dehydrogenase concentrations in the fluids. In summary, transforming growth factor-beta was a potent inducer of mesothelial cell collagen synthesis. Unlike talc and tetracycline, which provoked pleural inflammation, transforming growth factor-beta2 suppressed pleural inflammation in vivo. Transforming growth factor-beta2 can produce effective pleural fibrosis without necessitating acute pleural inflammation."

There were ten cases in which both the glucose and pH levels were low, and the cytology was positive in 9 cases (90%), while there were 40 cases in which both the glucose and pH levels were high and cytologic yields of 20 of these cases were positive (50%; p less than 0.03). The extension of the lesions observed during thoracoscopy showed important differences as far as this related to the glucose levels (p less than 0.005), but this relationship as it concerned pH levels was even more significant (p less than 0.0002).

        "abstract": "The mesothelium contains both procoagulant and fibrinolytic activities. An imbalance between these activities could account for the abnormal fibrin turnover and pleural fibrin deposition that is characteristic of pleural inflammation. Procoagulant activity of human pleural mesothelial cells (HPMC) is in part due to tissue factor, and the prothrombinase complex can also assemble at the HPMC surface. HPMC express tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) but no detectable fibrinolytic activity in a fibrin plate assay. Inhibition of HPMC fibrinolytic activity is due, in part, to elaboration of plasminogen activator inhibitors-1 and -2 (PAI-1 and PAI-2) as well as antiplasmins. Synthesis of PAI-1 and PAI-2 is inhibited by actinomycin D and cyclohexamide. HPMC PAI-1 is increased by transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), as is tPA release, while PAI-1 mRNA is unchanged and tPA mRNA is increased. PAI-2 release is induced by TNF-alpha and TGF-beta. Because they are a rich source of PAI-1 and PAI-2, HPMC may contribute to the high levels of these inhibitors in pleural exudates. Stimulation of HPMC by TNF-alpha or TGF-beta in vitro did not alter HPMC procoagulant activity nor the balance of elevated PAI and antiplasmins relative to PA, changes that collectively favor formation and persistence of pericellular fibrin."

        "abstract": "Diffuse pleural inflammation and fibrin deposition following the instillation of the sclerosing agent is considered necessary for a successful pleural symphysis. We hypothesized that an impairment in fibrin formation or an increased endopleural fibrinolysis would lead to failure of pleurodesis. To investigate changes in the pleural coagulation/fibrinolysis balance, we studied 75 consecutive patients who underwent thoracoscopy. Fifty-four of these patients with malignant pleural effusions and four with a benign recurrent effusion underwent thoracoscopic talc pleurodesis. Another four patients with malignancy and 13 with benign effusions had no talc poudrage performed and were included as a control group. Serial determinations of thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT), plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI), and D-dimer were made in pleural fluid samples taken at the beginning of thoracoscopy (baseline), immediately after thoracoscopic biopsies had been done (postbiopsy), 3 h after thoracoscopy--either with talc poudrage or without--and 24 and 48 h after the procedure, as well as in cases of recurrence of effusions (farline). Successful pleurodesis was obtained in 42 of 52 patients who could be evaluated (81%), and failure was seen in 10. Strong activation of coagulation and production of PAI was observed in all groups, including the control (no talc) group. Fibrinolytic activity (as expressed by D-dimer levels) showed a clear decline 24 h after talc poudrage in patients with a good outcome of pleurodesis, as oppossed to those with bad results and to the control group, and returned to the baseline by 15 d. We conclude that increased pleural fibrinolytic activity is associated with failure of pleurodesis, despite significant inhibitory activity of PAI in all groups."

        "abstract": "Elevated concentrations of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) are associated with pleural injury, but its effects on pleural organization remain unclear. A method of adenovirus-mediated delivery of genes of interest (expressed under a cytomegalovirus promoter) to rabbit pleura was developed and used with lacZ and human (h) PAI-1. Histology, &#x3b2;-galactosidase staining, Western blotting, enzymatic and immunohistochemical analyses of pleural fluids (PFs), lavages, and pleural mesothelial cells were used to evaluate the efficiency and effects of transduction. Transduction was selective and limited to the pleural mesothelial monolayer. The intrapleural expression of both genes was transient, with their peak expression at 4 to 5 days. On Day 5, hPAI-1 (40-80 and 200-400 nM of active and total hPAI-1 in lavages, respectively) caused no overt pleural injury, effusions, or fibrosis. The adenovirus-mediated delivery of hPAI-1 with subsequent tetracycline-induced pleural injury resulted in a significant exacerbation of the pleural fibrosis observed on Day 5 (P = 0.029 and P = 0.021 versus vehicle and adenoviral control samples, respectively). Intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy (IPFT) with plasminogen activators was effective in both animals overexpressing hPAI-1 and control animals with tetracycline injury alone. An increase in intrapleural active PAI-1 (from 10-15 nM in control animals to 20-40 nM in hPAI-1-overexpressing animals) resulted in the increased formation of PAI-1/plasminogen activator complexes in vivo. The decrease in intrapleural plasminogen-activating activity observed at 10 to 40 minutes after IPFT correlates linearly with the initial concentration of active PAI-1. Therefore, active PAI-1 in PFs affects the outcome of IPFT, and may be both a biomarker of pleural injury and a molecular target for its treatment."

        "abstract": "Chronic malignant pleural exudation is generally characterized by little or no fibrin deposition. However, during induced inflammation, fibrin deposition concomitant with cessation of exudation is seen. To judge the involvement of the fibrinolytic system in this process, concentrations of fibrinolytic factors were followed in 10 patients during treatment by quinacrine instillation and tube drainage. Plasminogen and alpha-2-antiplasmin were found in low concentrations and did not show significant changes during treatment. The plasminogen activator inhibitor PAI-1, which plays an important role in the regulation of fibrinolysis, was also studied during treatment. Before treatment the concentration of PAI-1 was 21.7 +/- 12.0 (mean +/- SD) AU/ml and it increased to 86.9 +/- 25.9 AU/ml 6 h after quinacrine instillation. D-dimer, a product of the lysis of fibrin, was found in high concentrations before treatment (62.7 +/- 25.5 micrograms/ml) and in low concentrations 6 h after treatment (12.2 +/- 7.9 micrograms/ml). Thus, it was possible to demonstrate that the fibrinolytic system is activated during chronic malignant pleural exudation and, furthermore, that the activity decreases during induced inflammation."

        "abstract": "In the pathogenesis of sepsis, inflammation and coagulation play a pivotal role. Increasing evidence points to an extensive cross-talk between these two systems, whereby inflammation leads to activation of coagulation, and coagulation also considerably affects inflammatory activity. Molecular pathways that contribute to inflammation-induced activation of coagulation have been precisely identified. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and other mediators are capable of activating the coagulation system and down-regulating important physiologic anticoagulant pathways. Activation of the coagulation system and ensuing thrombin generation is dependent on expression of tissue factor and the simultaneous down-regulation of endothelial-bound anticoagulant mechanisms and endogenous fibrinolysis. Conversely, activated coagulation proteases may affect specific cellular receptors on inflammatory cells and endothelial cells and thereby modulate the inflammatory response."

IL-8 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were measured in samples from 231 MPE patients before and after talc pleurodesis. Whole blood from 31 healthy volunteers was incubated with IL-8, TNF-alpha and thromboplastin for 3 h in vitro, and thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) levels were measured. The same stimulation of blood samples was repeated using doses of calibrated talc. Nine, 12 and 17 patients died within 7, 10 and 15 days respectively. IL-8 was elevated in 102 patients within 48 h, and thrombotic events were observed in six of those patients. Survival correlated inversely with IL-8 at 24 and 48 h, and a significant correlation was also found between IL-8 and TAT. A positive dose-dependent correlation with TAT production was observed when blood was stimulated with IL-8 in vitro. However, there was no significant response to stimulation with talc, as compared with control blood samples. IL-8 is involved in the activation of coagulation that may occur after talc pleurodesis, and might also be implicated in early death of patients with MPE."

The current review will focus on common features of fibrogenesis in parenchymal organs, and will briefly discuss common features and differences in the pathophysiology of fibrosis. Comparison of hepatic, renal, and pulmonary fibrosis has identified several common mechanisms. Common themes include a critical role for the cytokine transforming growth factor beta and the generation of reactive oxygen species. Activated myofibroblasts are the common cell type that produce the excessive fibrous scar and may originate from endogenous cells such as hepatic stellate cells or fibroblasts, from the bone marrow such as fibrocytes, or from the transition of epithelial cells to mesenchymal cells. These concepts open new prospects for multidisciplinary research and the development of new therapies for fibrosis."

        "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that altered components and posttranslational modifications of proteins in the extracellular matrix (ECM) may both initiate and drive disease progression. The ECM is a complex grid consisting of multiple proteins, most of which play a vital role in containing the essential information needed for maintenance of a sophisticated structure anchoring the cells and sustaining normal function of tissues. Therefore, the matrix itself may be considered as a paracrine/endocrine entity, with more complex functions than previously appreciated. The aims of this review are to 1) explore key structural and functional components of the ECM as exemplified by monogenetic disorders leading to severe pathologies, 2) discuss selected pathological posttranslational modifications of ECM proteins resulting in altered functional (signaling) properties from the original structural proteins, and 3) discuss how these findings support the novel concept that an increasing number of components of the ECM harbor signaling functions that can modulate fibrotic liver disease. The ECM entails functions in addition to anchoring cells and modulating their migratory behavior. Key ECM components and their posttranslational modifications often harbor multiple domains with different signaling potential, in particular when modified during inflammation or wound healing. This signaling by the ECM should be considered a paracrine/endocrine function, as it affects cell phenotype, function, fate, and finally tissue homeostasis. These properties should be exploited to establish novel biochemical markers and antifibrotic treatment strategies for liver fibrosis as well as other fibrotic diseases."

One group of rabbits received TCN (pH 2.0) in the left pleural space at a concentration of 35 mg/kg in 3.0 ml of saline solution. Four other groups of rabbits received DOXY in two concentrations (35 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg) and at two pHs (an acid of 2.0 and a NaOH neutralized pH of 7.6). No attempt was made to drain the pleural space after pleurodesis. At autopsy 2 weeks later, bloody fluid filled the pleural cavity and extensive intrapleural adhesions compressed the underlying lung. Microscopically, fibrin and collagen were diffusely deposited in the pleural connective tissue and in the intrapleural adhesions. The visceral pleural thickness increased from its normal value of 0.01 mm to values of 0.5 to 0.9 mm in the TCN and DOXY groups. Fibroblasts were the predominant inflammatory cell in the pleural connective tissue with few neutrophils or lymphocytes. No significant differences of histologic characteristics were observed between the TCN and DOXY groups. Alterations in pH or concentration in the DOXY groups produced similar changes in the gross and microscopic appearance of the pleural space. We conclude that DOXY is as effective as TCN in producing chemical pleurodesis. Doxycycline concentrations of 10 mg/kg were sufficient to substantially sclerose the pleural space in these healthy rabbits. Doxycycline pleurodesis was effective at neutral pH suggesting a mechanism of action independent of acid injury to the mesothelium."

        "abstract": "Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is a potent activator for cells of mesenchymal origin. PDGF stimulates chemotaxis, proliferation, and new gene expression in monocytes-macrophages and fibroblasts in vitro, cell types considered essential for tissue repair. Therefore, we analyzed the influence of exogenously administered recombinant B chain homodimers of PDGF (PDGF-BB) on two experimental tissue repair paradigms, incisional and excisional wounds. In both types of wounds, as little as 20-200 picomoles applied a single time to wounds significantly augmented the time dependent influx of inflammatory cells and fibroblasts and accelerated provisional extracellular matrix deposition and subsequent collagen formation. In incisional wounds, PDGF-BB augmented wound breaking strength 50-70% over the first 3 weeks; in excisional wounds, PDGF-BB accelerated time to closure by 30%. PDGF-BB exaggerated, but did not alter, the normal course of soft tissue repair, resulting in a significant acceleration of healing. Long term observations established no apparent differences between PDGF-BB treated and non-treated wounds. Thus, the vulnerary effects of PDGF-BB were transient and fully reversible in both wound healing models. Furthermore, analysis of PDGF-treated and non-treated wounds has provided important insights into mechanisms of normal and deficient tissue repair processes. PDGF appears to transduce its signal through wound macrophages and may trigger the induction of positive autocrine feedback loops and synthesis of endogenous wound PDGF and other growth factors, thereby enhancing the cascade of tissue repair processes required for a fully-healed wound. Thus, PDGF and other wound produced polypeptide growth factors may be the critical regulators of extracellular matrix deposition within healing wounds."

We and others recently reported that human MC are a source of basic fibroblast growth factor (b FGF-2), a potent angiogenic and mitogenic polypeptide, in several disease conditions, such as chronic inflammation, hemangioma, and benign cutaneous mastocytosis. These findings suggest that FGF-2 may be an important mediator of cell proliferation and angiogenesis associated with MC. Since MC are heterogeneous across species, it is unknown whether FGF-2 expression is a feature common to all MC, or whether FGF-2 expression by MC can be regulated. We therefore examined FGF-2 expression by MC in mouse tissue and MC lines."

Through the RNA-seq analysis, we had identified that the hedgehog (Hh) canonical pathway genes including Smoothened (Smo) and Gli1, were regulated by bFGF. Further analysis revealed that activation of the Hh pathway via up-regulation of Smo promoted fibroblast migration, invasion, and skin wound healing, but which significantly reduced by GANT61, a selective antagonist of Gli1/Gli2. Western blot analyses and siRNA transfection assays demonstrated that Smo acted upstream of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-&#x3b2;-catenin to promote cell migration. Moreover, RNA-seq and qRT-PCR analyses revealed that Hh pathway genes including Smo and Gli1 were under control of &#x3b2;-catenin, suggesting that &#x3b2;-catenin turn feedback activates Hh signaling. Taken together, our analyses identified a new bFGF-regulating mechanism by which Hh signaling regulates human fibroblast migration, and the data presented here opens a new avenue for the wound healing therapy."

        "abstract": "Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has been discovered, purified, and molecularly cloned as a potent mitogen for mature hepatocytes. HGF is a heterodimeric molecule composed of a 69 kDa alpha-subunit and a 34 kDa subunit. It contains four kringle domains in the alpha-subunit. It is produced by mesenchymal cells and predominantly acts on a wide variety of epithelial cells as a mitogen (stimulation of cell growth), a motogen (stimulation of cell motility), and a morphogen (induction of multicellular tissue-like structure). These pleiotropic functions of HGF are essential biological activities for the construction of normal tissue architecture. HGF may be one of the long-sought paracrine mediators of morphogenetic epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. On the other hand, HGF receptor was identified as the product of the c-met proto-oncogene, which encodes a 190-kDa transmembrane protein possessing tyrosine kinase domain. HGF mRNA and HGF protein are rapidly and markedly increased in the liver and plasma of rats with various types of liver injuries. HGF receptors on plasma membranes of the liver were almost completely down-regulated due to HGF binding and subsequent internalization. Therefore, HGF acts as a hepatotropic factor for liver regeneration. Recombinant HGF, intravenously injected into mice, remarkably enhances liver regeneration. After various renal and lung injuries, HGF mRNA, HGF protein, and HGF receptors in the kidney and lung are also rapidly altered prior to the onset of replication of renal tubular cells and lung alveolar epithelial cells Recombinant HGF intravenously injected into rats also remarkably enhances renal and lung regeneration. Thus, HGF acts as a renotropic factor in renal regeneration and as a plumotropic factor in lung regeneration. It is considered a key molecule for the construction of normal tissue structure during embryogenesis, organogenesis, and organ regeneration."

        "abstract": "Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has been shown to reduce renal injury in a variety of animal models of chronic renal disease. Suggested mechanisms to explain this action include prevention of tubular cell apoptosis, blocking epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and promotion of extracellular matrix degradation. Inflammation is another common finding in kidneys that progress to end-stage renal failure; however, the effect of HGF on inflammation has hardly been investigated. For examining this issue, beginning 2 wk after subtotal nephrectomy, rats received a continuous infusion of recombinant HGF, neutralization of endogenous HGF by daily injection of an anti-HGF antibody, or preimmune IgG for an additional 2 wk. HGF infusion halted the progression of proteinuria and decreased renal collagen accumulation. Renal inflammation in both glomeruli and tubulointerstitium was significantly attenuated, associated with reductions in the tubular expression of the chemokines macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and RANTES (regulated upon expression normal T cell expressed and secreted). In contrast, HGF neutralization worsened renal fibrosis, aggravated renal inflammation, and enhanced tubular expression of MCP-1 and RANTES. In vitro, HGF suppressed basal and TNF-alpha-induced expression of these chemokines at both the mRNA and protein levels in a time- and dose-dependent manner in proximal tubular epithelial cells. HGF also blunted TNF-alpha-induced nuclear translocation and activation of NF-kappaB, a pivotal transcription factor that regulates chemokine expression. Immunohistochemistry showed that activated NF-kappaB was evident in tubules in remnant kidneys and increased remarkably with anti-HGF treatment. HGF infusion markedly suppressed expression of activated NF-kappaB in remnant kidneys. These findings suggest that the beneficial effect of HGF in chronic renal disease is attributable, at least in part, to a direct anti-inflammatory action, likely via NF-kappaB, on tubular epithelial cells."

        "abstract": "The worldwide increment of multidrug- and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis has emphasized the importance of looking for new options in therapeutics. Long-time usage or higher doses of isoniazid and rifampicin have been considered for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; however, the risk of liver failure is proportionally increased. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a multitask growth factor that stimulates both antiapoptotic and antioxidant responses that counteract the toxic effects of drug metabolism in the liver. The present work was focused to address the antioxidant and antiapoptotic effects of HGF on isoniazid- and rifampicin-induced hepatotoxicity. BALB/c mice were subjected to rifampicin (150mg/kg, intragavage [ig]) plus isoniazid (75mg/kg, ig) for 7 days. Increments in alanine aminotransferase activity, steatosis, apoptosis, and oxidative stress markers were found in animals. Recombinant HGF (iv) prevented all the harmful effects by increasing the activation of Erk1/2 and PKC&#x3b4; signaling pathways and glutathione (GSH) synthesis. Furthermore, inhibition of endogenous HGF with anti-HGF antibody (iv) enhanced the isoniazid- and rifampicin-induced oxidative stress damage and decreased the GSH content, aggravating liver damage. In conclusion, HGF demonstrated to be a good protective factor against antituberculosis drug-induced hepatotoxicity and could be considered a good adjuvant factor for the use of high doses of or the reintroduction of these antituberculosis drugs."

        "abstract": "NK4 exhibits two distinct biological actions: antagonistic inhibition of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) through binding to the Met/HGF receptor, and antiangiogenic action through binding to perlecan. Here, the anti-tumor effect of NK4 on malignant pleural mesothelioma was investigated. Of the 7 human malignant mesothelioma cell lines (ACC-Meso-1, ACC-Meso-4, EHMES-1, EHMES-10, H28, H2052 and JMN-1B), only EHMES-10 cells formed subcutaneous tumors when implanted into mice. For EHMES-10 cells, HGF facilitated invasion of the cells in collagen gel, whereas NK4 and neutralizing anti-HGF antibody suppressed the HGF-induced invasion. In addition, NK4 but not anti-HGF antibody suppressed proliferation of EHMES-10 cells in collagen, suggesting that the suppression by NK4 was independent of the HGF-Met pathway. In the subcutaneous tumor model, recombinant adenovirus-mediated intratumoral expression of NK4 inhibited tumor growth, while the invasive characteristic of tumor cells was not observed. Analysis of Met receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, proliferation, apoptosis and blood vessels in the tumor tissues indicated that the inhibitory effect of NK4 expression might be primarily caused by the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. In all the 7 mesothelioma lines, HGF stimulated Met tyrosine phosphorylation, and this was associated with enhanced cell migration. HGF-dependent Met activation and migration were inhibited by NK4. Since malignant pleural mesothelioma represents an aggressive neoplasm characterized by extensive invasive growth, suppression of invasive growth has therapeutic value. Thus, the simultaneous inhibition of the HGF-Met pathway and angiogenesis by NK4 for treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma is significant, particularly to attenuate migration and invasive growth."

        "abstract": "Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a diverse group of proteolytic enzymes and play an important role in the degradation and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM). In normal physiological conditions, MMPs are usually minimally expressed. Despite their low expression, MMPs have been implicated in many cellular processes ranging from embryological development to apoptosis. The activity of MMPs is controlled at three different stages: (1) transcription; (2) zymogen activation; and (3) inhibition of active forms by tissue inhibitor metalloproteinases (TIMPs). They can collectively degrade any component of ECM and basement membrane, and their excessive activity has been linked to numerous pathologies mainly including, but not limited to, tumor invasion and metastasis. The lack of information about several MMPs and the steady stream of new discoveries suggest that there is much more to be studied in this field. In particular, there is a need for controlling their expression in disease states. Various studies over the past 30 years have found that each MMP has a specific mode of activation, action, and inhibition. Drugs specifically targeting individual MMPs could revolutionize the treatment of a great number of health conditions and tremendously reduce their burden. In this review article, we have summarized the recent advances in understanding the role of MMPs in physiological and pathological conditions. J. Cell.

        "abstract": "The matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) are proteolytic enzymes that are essentially involved in the turnover of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Their activity is counterbalanced by specific antagonists, the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP). In this study, we sought to analyze the expression of MMP and TIMP isoforms in pleural effusions from 88 patients. We compared MMP and TIMP isoform expression in transudates (n = 21) and exudates (n = 67), the latter divided into exudates of paraneoplastic (n = 46) or parainfectious (n = 21) origin. Zymographic and Western blot analyses revealed constant expression of interstitial collagenase (MMP-1), gelatinase-A (MMP-2), and TIMP-1 in all 88 samples. In contrast, analyses of gelatinase-B (MMP-9) demonstrated a specific expression pattern, with high expression in exudates and lack of expression in transudates. Neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8) was detected in trace amounts, and correlated with the number of neutrophils in the effusion. Low levels of TIMP-2 were detected only in exudates and not in transudates. Quantitative analysis of the expression ratio of gelatinase-B to gelatinase-A revealed statistically significant differences between effusions of different origin. The ratio was highest in exudates of paraneoplastic origin and lowest in transudates. Our data thus suggest that interstitial collagenase, gelatinase-A, and TIMP-1 play a role in homeostasis of the pleural space in vivo as constitutively expressed proteins, whereas gelatinase-B and TIMP-2 expression are induced in specific disease states. These observations contribute to the understanding of the pathophysiology of pleural effusions, and may help to characterize and possibly distinguish effusions of different origin."

MMPs recently have been described in pleural fluid from patients with both exudative and transudative effusions. Since tetracyclines are recognized inhibitors of other metalloproteinases, we investigated their inhibitory capacity in pleural fluid. High concentrations of several different tetracyclines reduced MMP activity of pleural fluid by more than 75 percent. Lower concentrations (&lt; or = 1 mg/ml) had only modest inhibitory effects. High concentration of of tetracyclines also inhibited cell synthesis of MMPs, in vitro, but other measures of vital cell function were also impaired. We conclude that tetracyclines are effective inhibitors of MMP activity in pleural fluid and may also reduce synthesis of MMPs via non specific cell injury. These data suggest a possible mechanism to account for tetracycline pleurodesis; ie, an inhibition of MMP activity in pleural fluid."

Multiple redundant pathways of initiation and elusive temporal expression of initiators pose formidable barriers to effective treatment. Nowhere is this more evident than in the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a systemic inflammatory disorder leading to pulmonary failure where, despite significant advances in intensive care management, mortality has improved only 10% over the last decade. Tetracyclines, in addition to their anti-microbial properties, exhibit inhibitory activity toward several initiators of the inflammatory cascade and mediators of tissue damage. In this review we discuss how the broad spectrum anti-inflammatory properties of the tetracyclines make them attractive candidates for use in the prevention of acute lung injury."

Batimastat (BB-94) is a broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor that causes resolution of ascites and/or tumor growth delay in animal models of breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancer. We recruited 18 patients with cytologically positive malignant pleural effusions into a Phase I study of intrapleural BB-94. Three patients received single doses of BB-94 at each dose level: 15, 30, 60, 105, 135, and 300 mg/m2. Two patients were retreated with a second course at 60 and 105 mg/m2. BB-94 was detectable in plasma 1 h after intrapleural administration, and peak levels of 20-200 ng/ml occurred after 4 h to 1 week. BB-94 persisted in the plasma for up to 12 weeks, at levels exceeding the IC50s for target MMPs. Peak values were higher, and persistence in the plasma was longer after higher doses of BB-94. The treatment was well tolerated. Toxic effects included low-grade fever for 24-48 h (6 of 18 patients, 33%) and reversible asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes (8 patients, 44%). Toxicity seemed unrelated to BB-94 dose or plasma levels. Sixteen patients evaluable for response required significantly fewer pleural aspirations in the 3 months after BB-94 compared with the 3 months before. Seven patients (44%) required no further pleural aspiration until death/last follow-up. After 1 month, patients treated with 60-300 mg/m2 BB-94 had significantly better dyspnea scores, indicating improved exercise tolerance, compared with baseline scores the day after BB-94. The maximum tolerated intrapleural dose remains to be defined, but it is clear that intrapleural BB-94 is well tolerated, with evidence of local activity."

Neither an extracellular receptor for endostatin nor intracellular signals that result in the regression of tumor vascular beds have been identified. We demonstrate that endostatin, but not angiostatin, at comparable concentrations to those used in in vivo animal trials, rapidly down-regulates many genes in exponentially growing endothelial cells. These include immediate early response genes, cell cycle-related genes, and genes regulating apoptosis inhibitors, mitogen-activated protein kinases, focal adhesion kinase, G-protein-coupled receptors mediating endothelial growth, a mitogenic factor, adhesion molecules, and cell structure components. Suppression of both apoptosis inhibitors and cell proliferation genes may have a limited contribution to the antiangiogenesis process because endostatin induces neither apoptosis nor growth inhibition, unless studied under reduced serum conditions. In contrast, the antimigratory effect of endostatin was rapid and potent even under serum-supplemented conditions. Endostatin caused gene suppression and migration arrest exclusively in endothelial cells, most profoundly in microvascular endothelial cells. The c-myc null fibroblasts obtained by targeted homologous recombination showed an attenuated migration rate compared with isogenic parental cells, whereas the introduction of the c-myc gene into endothelial cells abrogated the antimigratory effect of endostatin. Inhibition of E-box-driven transcription by overexpressing max or mad suppressed endothelial migration. Thus, rapid down-regulation of genes by endostatin neither restores proliferating endothelial cells to their resting states nor induces apoptosis; rather, it potently inhibits endothelial cell migration partly via suppression of c-myc expression."

The present study evaluated the angiogenic balance in the pleural space in patients with malignant pleural effusions (MPE) following talc insufflation. Patient pleural fluid samples were collected both before and after talc insufflation. The ability of pleural mesothelial cells (PMC) and malignant mesothelioma cells (MMC) to produce endostatin in vitro was compared. The biological effects of pleural fluids and conditioned media from talc-activated PMC on endothelial cells were evaluated by performing proliferation, invasion, tube formation and apoptosis assays. Pleural fluids from patients with MPE who received thoracoscopic talc insufflation contained significantly higher levels of endostatin (median 16.75 ng.mL(-1)) compared with pre-talc instillation (1.06 ng.mL(-1)). Talc-activated PMC released significantly greater amounts of endostatin (mean+/-SEM 1052.39+/-38.66 pg.mL(-1)) when compared with a MMC line (134.73+/-8.72 pg.mL(-1)). In conclusion, talc alters the angiogenic balance in the pleural space from a biologically active and angiogenic environment to an angiostatic milieu. Functional improvement following talc poudrage in patients with malignant pleural effusions may, in part, reflect these alterations in the pleural space."

Over 150,000 patients in the United States suffer from breathlessness and diminished quality of life due to MPE each year. Current management strategies are of mostly palliative value and focus on symptom control; they do not address the pathobiology of the effusion, nor do they improve survival. Further elucidation of the pathophysiological mechanisms, coupled with the development of novel treatments such as intrapleural chemotherapeutics targeting this process, has the potential to greatly improve the efficacy of our current management options. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) has been implicated as a critical cytokine in the formation of malignant pleural effusions. Elevated levels of VEGF produced by tumor cells, mesothelial cells, and infiltrating immune cells result in increased vascular permeability, cancer cell transmigration, and angiogenesis. Therefore antiangiogenic therapies such as Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting VEGF-A, may have a potential role in the management of malignant pleural effusions. Herein we review the pathogenesis and potential treatment strategies of malignant pleural effusions, with a focus on angiogenesis and antiangiogenic therapeutics."

        "abstract": "The expression of angiogenic factors may represent useful markers for diagnosis and prediction of disease outcome. Basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF) is a potent angiogenic factor which promotes in vitro growth of endothelial cells and in vivo vessel formation. We investigated the expression of b-FGF in patients affected with malignant and non-malignant pleural diseases and presenting clinically with non-specific signs and symptoms. We also studied the relationships between the expression of b-FGF in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MM) and tumour aggressiveness, assessed as tumour vessel density (TVD), or patient survival. Basic-FGF was measured by immunoassay in the serum and pleural effusions (PE) of 37 patients. Of these, MM was diagnosed in 15/37 patients while the remaining patients had either peripheral lung adenocarcinoma (PLA) or benign inflammatory pleural disease (BPD). The mean b-FGF level measured 8.5+/-6.1 pg/ml in the PE of the malignant group (MM + PLA) and 23.9+/-19.8 in the PE of the non-malignant group (BPD) (p=0.001). The mean b-FGF level was significantly lower in the PE of MM patients (6.9+/-5.2 pg/ml) compared to BPD patients (p=0.004). Linear regression analysis showed a significant inverse correlation (r=-0.59; p=0.041) between b-FGF levels found in MM PE and patient survival. A noteworthy relationship between high serum b-FGF levels and reduced survival was also observed (r=-0.57; p=0.052). Interestingly, both serum (r=0.48; p=0.114) and PE (r=0.26; p=0.413) b-FGF levels in MM patients correlated poorly with TVD. Our data indicate that b-FGF is significantly more expressed in non-malignant compared to malignant PE, this difference being particularly evident between MM and BPD. Our results also suggest that high b-FGF levels correlate with poor MM patient survival through mechanisms which may be independent of b-FGF angiogenic potential."

        "abstract": "VPF/VEGF is a multifunctional cytokine that contributes to angiogenesis by both direct and indirect mechanisms. On the one hand, VPF/VEGF stimulates the ECs lining nearby microvessels to proliferate, to migrate, and to alter their pattern of gene expression. On the other hand, VPF/VEGF renders these same microvascular ECs hyperpermeable so that they spill plasma proteins into the extravascular space, leading to the clotting of extravasated fibrinogen with deposition of a fibrin gel. Extravascular fibrin serves as a provisional matrix that favors and supports the ingrowth of new blood vessels and other mesenchymal cells that generate mature, vascularized stroma. These same principles apply in tumors, in several examples of non-neoplastic pathology, and in physiological processes that involve angiogenesis and new stroma generation. In all of these examples, microvascular hyperpermeability and the introduction of a provisional, plasma-derived matrix precede and accompany the onset of EC division and new blood vessel formation. It would seem, therefore, that tumors have \"borrowed\" fundamental mechanisms that developed in multicellular organisms for purposes of tissue defense, renewal, and repair. VPF/VEGF, therefore has taught us something new about angiogenesis; namely, that vascular hyperpermeability and consequent plasma protein extravasation are important, perhaps essential, elements in its generation. However, this finding raises a paradox. While VPF/VEGF induces vascular hyperpermeability, other potent angiogenic factors apparently do not, at least in subtoxic concentrations that are more than sufficient to induce angiogenesis. Nonetheless, wherever angiogenesis has been studied, the newly generated vessels have been found to be hyperpermeable. How, therefore, do angiogenic factors other than VPF/VEGF lead to the formation of new and leaky blood vessels? We do not as yet have a complete answer to this question. One possibility is that at least some angiogenic factors mediate their effect by inducing or stimulating the expression of VPF/VEGF. In fact, there is already one clear example of this. TGF-alpha is a potent angiogenic factor but does not itself increase microvascular permeability. However, TGF-alpha strikingly upregulates VPF/VEGF expression in cultured keratinocytes and is thought to be responsible, at least in part, for the overexpression of VPF/VEGF in psoriasis. Moreover, overexpression of TGF-alpha, along with that of the EGF receptor with which it interacts, is characteristic of many malignant tumors, raising the possibility that TGF-alpha acts to stimulate VPF/VEGF expression in other types of epithelial cells and in this manner induces angiogenesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

We found recently, using a nude mouse model, that vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor (VEGF/VPF) is responsible for PE induced by non-small cell human lung carcinoma cells. The purpose of this study was to determine the therapeutic potential of a VEGF/VPF receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation inhibitor, PTK 787, against PE formed by human lung adenocarcinoma (PC14PE6) cells. PTK 787 did not affect the in vitro proliferation of PC14PE6 cells, whereas it specifically inhibited proliferation of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells stimulated by VEGF/VPF. A specific platelet-derived growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, CGP57148 (used as a control because PTK 787 also inhibits platelet-derived growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases), had no effect on proliferation of PC14PE6 or human dermal microvascular endothelial cells. i.v. injection of PC14PE6 cells into nude mice produced lung lesions and a large volume of PE containing a high level of VEGF/VPF. Oral treatment with CGP57148 had no effect on PE or lung metastasis. In contrast, oral treatment with PTK 787 significantly reduced the formation of PE but not the number of lung lesions. Furthermore, treatment with PTK 787 significantly suppressed vascular hyperpermeability of PE-bearing mice but did not affect the VEGF/VPF level in PE or expression of VEGF/VPF protein and mRNA in the lung tumors of PC14PE6 cells in vivo. These findings indicate that PTK 787 reduced PE formation mainly by inhibiting vascular permeability, suggesting that this VEGF/VPF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor could be useful for the control of malignant PE."

Fibrin tissue adhesive- and tetracycline-treated rats had significantly more adhesions compared to the control group, whereas fibrin tissue adhesive was more effective for pleurodesis than tetracycline and no deaths or major side effects were observed in any rat.

Dense pleural adhesions due to past pleurodesis for chylothorax were observed and dissected in both thoracic cavities. The patient developed chylothorax after transplant. Chylothorax in the right thoracic cavity was successfully treated by conventional pleurodesis; however, pleural effusion from the left thoracic cavity was not reduced. According to fluoroscopic images obtained by injecting a contrast medium through the chest tube, the remaining pleural space in the left thoracic cavity was small and localized in the lower region adjacent to the mediastinum. We opted to fill this space with fibrin glue; we injected fibrinogen and thrombin solution into the space through the chest tube. We performed fibrin glue treatment three times and pleural effusion was dramatically decreased. We removed the chest tube on day 107 post-transplant. No recurrent chylothorax has been recorded for 10 years after lung transplantation."

The aim of the present study is to describe the effects of sericin when used for pleurodesis and/or as tissue glue. <b>Methods</b>&#x2003;Adult, male, 12-week-old Wistar albino rats, weighing 257 to 395&#x2009;g were used in the present study (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;12). The animals were randomly divided into two equal groups as the sericin and the control group. After intramuscular administration of the anesthetic agent, the rats were intubated and mechanically ventilated. A left thoracotomy was performed and 30&#x2009;mg sericin powder was instilled into the thoraxes of the sericin group. The remaining rats were allocated to a sham thoracotomy group. The animals were housed in individual cages, fed ad-libitum, and sacrificed 8 days after. After sacrifice, the left hemithoraxes were removed en bloc and underwent histopathologic examination. <b>Results</b>&#x2003;Masson trichrome staining was applied on the visceral pleura sections of all the animals. Each animal specimen (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;6, 100%) in the control group showed minimal collagen deposition, while only one rat (16.67%) in the sericin group had minimal collagen deposition. However, in the sericin group, five animals (83.33%) showed dense collagen deposition, fibroblastic activity, and fibrosis. According to the test method, independent <i>t</i>-test, developing fibroblastic activity and fibrosis are statistically significant between the two groups (<i>p</i>&#x2009;&lt;&#x2009;0.01). There were no foreign-body reactions and no evidence of biological glue on the specimens in the sericin group. The rats in the sericin group had lower inflammatory reactions compared with those in the control group. Emphysema was observed in two rats (33.33%) in the sericin group and in four rats (66.67%) in the control group. Therefore, sericin was found to be associated with an increase in fibroblastic activity and fibrosis in visceral pleura without exerting any adverse effect on the lung parenchyma. <b>Conclusion</b>&#x2003;Sericin is a new and researchable protein for chest diseases and thoracic surgery. To develop an effect of dense collagen deposition, fibroblastic activity, and fibrosis in the visceral pleura, without significant adverse effects, is remarkable. Therefore, sericin may be useful as a pleurodesis agent or natural biological glue in the future. Sericin treatment can add value to the disciplines of pulmonology and thoracic surgery."

        "abstract": "Malignant pleural effusion (PE) is associated with advanced human lung cancer. We found recently, using a nude mouse model, that vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular permeability factor (VEGF/VPF) is responsible for PE induced by non-small cell human lung carcinoma cells. The purpose of this study was to determine the therapeutic potential of a VEGF/VPF receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation inhibitor, PTK 787, against PE formed by human lung adenocarcinoma (PC14PE6) cells. PTK 787 did not affect the in vitro proliferation of PC14PE6 cells, whereas it specifically inhibited proliferation of human dermal microvascular endothelial cells stimulated by VEGF/VPF. A specific platelet-derived growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, CGP57148 (used as a control because PTK 787 also inhibits platelet-derived growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases), had no effect on proliferation of PC14PE6 or human dermal microvascular endothelial cells. i.v. injection of PC14PE6 cells into nude mice produced lung lesions and a large volume of PE containing a high level of VEGF/VPF. Oral treatment with CGP57148 had no effect on PE or lung metastasis. In contrast, oral treatment with PTK 787 significantly reduced the formation of PE but not the number of lung lesions. Furthermore, treatment with PTK 787 significantly suppressed vascular hyperpermeability of PE-bearing mice but did not affect the VEGF/VPF level in PE or expression of VEGF/VPF protein and mRNA in the lung tumors of PC14PE6 cells in vivo. These findings indicate that PTK 787 reduced PE formation mainly by inhibiting vascular permeability, suggesting that this VEGF/VPF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor could be useful for the control of malignant PE."

        "abstract": "Pleural injury results in the death of mesothelial cells and denudation of the mesothelial basement membrane. Repair of the mesothelium without fibrosis requires proliferation and migration of mesothelial cells into the injured area. We hypothesized that monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) induces proliferative and haptotactic responses in pleural mesothelial cells (PMCs) and that the MCP-1 binding receptor CCR2 mediates the pleural repair process. We demonstrate that PMCs exhibited MCP-1-specific immunostaining on injury. MCP-1 induced proliferative and haptotactic responses in PMCs. PMCs express CCR2 in a time-dependent manner. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis demonstrated that interleukin (IL)-2 upregulated CCR2 protein expression in PMCs, whereas lipopolysaccharide (LPS) downregulated the response at the initial period compared with that in resting PMCs. However, the inhibitory potential of LPS was lost after 12 h and showed a similar response at 24 and 48 h. Haptotactic migration was upregulated in PMCs that were cultured in the presence of IL-2. The increased haptotactic capacity of mesothelial cells in the presence of IL-2 correlated with increased CCR2 mRNA expression. PMCs cultured in the presence of LPS showed decreased haptotactic activity to MCP-1. Blocking the CCR2 with neutralizing antibodies decreased the haptotactic response of PMCs to MCP-1. These results suggest that the haptotactic migration of mesothelial cells in response to MCP-1 are mediated through CCR2, which may play a crucial role in reepithelialization of the denuded basement membrane at the site of pleural injury and may thus contribute to the regeneration of the mesothelium during the process of pleural repair."

        "abstract": "The pleural space, a sterile secluded environment in the thoracic cavity, represents an attractive metastatic site for various cancers of lung, breast and gastrointestinal origins. Whereas lung and breast adenocarcinomas could invade the pleural space because of their anatomic proximity, \"distant\" cancers like ovarian or gastrointestinal tract adenocarcinomas may employ more active mechanisms to the same end. A pleural metastasis is often accompanied by a malignant pleural effusion (MPE), an unfavorable complication that severely restricts the quality of life and expectancy of the cancer patient. MPE is the net \"product\" of three different processes, namely inflammation, enhanced angiogenesis and vascular leakage. Current efforts are focusing on the identification of cancer cell autocrine (specific mutation spectra and biochemical pathways) and paracrine (cytokine and chemokine signals) characteristics as well as host features (immunological or other) that underlie the MPE phenotype. Herein we examine the pleural histology, cytology and molecular characteristics that make the pleural cavity an attractive metastasis destination for lung adenocarcinoma. Mesothelial and tumor features that may account for the tumor's ability to invade the pleural space are highlighted. Finally, possible therapeutic interventions specifically targeting MPE are discussed."

        "abstract": "Malignant pleural effusion (MPE) is common and difficult to treat. In the vast majority of patients the presence of MPE heralds incurable disease, associated with poor quality of life, morbidity and mortality. Current therapeutic approaches are inefficient and merely offer palliation of associated symptoms. Recent scientific progress has shed light in the biologic processes governing the mechanisms behind the pathobiology of MPE. Pleural based tumors interfere with pleural fluid drainage, as well as the host vasculature and immune system, resulting in decreased fluid absorption and increased pleural fluid production via enhanced plasma extravasation into the pleural space. In order to achieve this feat, pleural based tumors must elicit critical vasoactive events in the pleura, thus forming a favorable microenvironment for tumor dissemination and MPE development. Such properties involve specific transcriptional signaling cascades in addition to secretion of important mediators which attract and activate host cell populations which, in turn, impact tumor cell functions. The dissection of the biologic steps leading to MPE formation provides novel therapeutic targets and recent research findings provide encouraging results towards future therapeutic innovations in MPE management."

The two major contraindications to the procedure are an unexpandable lung ( ' trapped lung ' ) and inability to remove pleural fluid, e.g. due to multiple loculations. This is because the formation of effective pleural adhesions after administration of sclerosing agent requires a close and direct contact between the parietal and visceral pleura. Thus, an effective withdrawal of pleural effusion and the ability of the lung to reexpand are important prerequisites for efficient pleurodesis. The overall effectiveness of chemical pleurodesis in prevention of reaccumulation of MPE ranges between 41.3 and 100% and depends on different factors, including cancer type, extension of pleural involvement and the sclerosant used for pleurodesis [9 -11].

To our knowledge, there have been no studies either on the effect of pleurodesis on HGF activity or potentially profibrogenic effects of anti-HGF antibodies in the pleural cavity.

The two major contraindications to the procedure are an unexpandable lung ( ' trapped lung ' ) and inability to remove pleural fluid, e.g. due to multiple loculations. This is because the formation of effective pleural adhesions after administration of sclerosing agent requires a close and direct contact between the parietal and visceral pleura.

In the remaining patients, procedures that reduce the future risk of pleural effusion recurrence should be considered, with chemical pleurodesis being the major therapeutic option. It must be emphasized, however, that not all patients with recurrent malignant pleural effusion are suitable candidates for chemical pleurodesis. The two major contraindications to the procedure are an unexpandable lung ( ' trapped lung ' ) and inability to remove pleural fluid, e.g. due to multiple loculations. This is because the formation of effective pleural adhesions after administration of sclerosing agent requires a close and direct contact between the parietal and visceral pleura. Thus, an effective withdrawal of pleural effusion and the ability of the lung to reexpand are important prerequisites for efficient pleurodesis. The overall effectiveness of chemical pleurodesis in prevention of reaccumulation of MPE ranges between 41.3 and 100% and depends on different factors, including cancer type, extension of pleural involvement and the sclerosant used for pleurodesis [9 -11]. Another increasingly popular therapeutic option that might also be offered to patients with unexpandable lung is chest tube insertion to permanently drain the pleural fluid (indwelling or tunneled pleural catheter, IPC). Pleuroperitoneal [12] or pleuro-venal [13, 14] shunts are hardly ever used anymore, because of the invasive character of the procedure and the high complication rate.

Several studies showed that antiHGF antibodies induce fibrosis by neutralizing endogenous HGF.

To our knowledge, there have been no studies either on the effect of pleurodesis on HGF activity or potentially profibrogenic effects of anti-HGF antibodies in the pleural cavity.

In the remaining patients, procedures that reduce the future risk of pleural effusion recurrence should be considered, with chemical pleurodesis being the major therapeutic option. It must be emphasized, however, that not all patients with recurrent malignant pleural effusion are suitable candidates for chemical pleurodesis. The two major contraindications to the procedure are an unexpandable lung ( ' trapped lung ' ) and inability to remove pleural fluid, e.g. due to multiple loculations. This is because the formation of effective pleural adhesions after administration of sclerosing agent requires a close and direct contact between the parietal and visceral pleura. Thus, an effective withdrawal of pleural effusion and the ability of the lung to reexpand are important prerequisites for efficient pleurodesis. The overall effectiveness of chemical pleurodesis in prevention of reaccumulation of MPE ranges between 41.3 and 100% and depends on different factors, including cancer type, extension of pleural involvement and the sclerosant used for pleurodesis [9 -11]. Another increasingly popular therapeutic option that might also be offered to patients with unexpandable lung is chest tube insertion to permanently drain the pleural fluid (indwelling or tunneled pleural catheter, IPC). Pleuroperitoneal [12] or pleuro-venal [13, 14] shunts are hardly ever used anymore, because of the invasive character of the procedure and the high complication rate.

The pleural effects of this cytokine were investigated in pleural fibrosis (fibrothorax) complicating pleural empyema [90]. It was demonstrated that HGF can cause opposite effects to those elicited by TGFβ and bFGF. Namely, it prevented adhesion formation and promoted the regeneration of the mesothelium cell layer. Several studies showed that antiHGF antibodies induce fibrosis by neutralizing endogenous HGF. This phenomenon has been observed in animal models in the kidneys [91], liver [92] and lung diseases [93]. To our knowledge, there have been no studies either on the effect of pleurodesis on HGF activity or potentially profibrogenic effects of anti-HGF antibodies in the pleural cavity. However, it can be hypothesized that inhibition of HGF might enhance pleural fibrogenesis initiated by the sclerosing agent. This hypothesis should be tested in future studies. When discussing HGF in the context of MPE, it should be mentioned that one Japanese study showed an anti-tumor effect of anti-HGF and NK4 (a HGF fragment -competitive inhibitor of HGF-Met receptor) on malignant pleural mesothelioma [94].",

As the vast majority of these agents are chemicals, the term ' chemical pleurodesis ' is commonly used.

In patients with recurrent pleural effusion, pleurodesis is a symptomatic treatment that prevents dyspnea related to relatively rapid reaccumulation of pleural fluid after its earlier withdrawal. Thus, the beneficial effect of pleurodesis in patients with pleural effusion can be observed within weeks or months after the procedure. In recurrent spontaneous pneumothorax, pleurodesis has a more delayed effect (months, years), as it is not applied to treat the current pneumothorax episode, but it is aimed to prevent future pneumothorax recurrences.",

In the remaining patients, procedures that reduce the future risk of pleural effusion recurrence should be considered, with chemical pleurodesis being the major therapeutic option. It must be emphasized, however, that not all patients with recurrent malignant pleural effusion are suitable candidates for chemical pleurodesis. The two major contraindications to the procedure are an unexpandable lung ( ' trapped lung ' ) and inability to remove pleural fluid, e.g. due to multiple loculations. This is because the formation of effective pleural adhesions after administration of sclerosing agent requires a close and direct contact between the parietal and visceral pleura. Thus, an effective withdrawal of pleural effusion and the ability of the lung to reexpand are important prerequisites for efficient pleurodesis. The overall effectiveness of chemical pleurodesis in prevention of reaccumulation of MPE ranges between 41.3 and 100% and depends on different factors, including cancer type, extension of pleural involvement and the sclerosant used for pleurodesis [9 -11]. Another increasingly popular therapeutic option that might also be offered to patients with unexpandable lung is chest tube insertion to permanently drain the pleural fluid (indwelling or tunneled pleural catheter, IPC). Pleuroperitoneal [12] or pleuro-venal [13, 14] shunts are hardly ever used anymore, because of the invasive character of the procedure and the high complication rate. With IPC, symptomatic relief can be achieved in 70 -94.2% patients with MPE [15, 16]. Moreover, it has been shown that drainage of the pleural cavity may lead to spontaneous pleurodesis [17].",
