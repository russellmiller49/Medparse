    "abstract": "Introduction : Rigid bronchoscopy is an invaluable tool for the management of airway disorders and an essential skill for an interventional pulmonologist. Since its introduction in the late 19th century, it has remained an important technique for the management of central airway obstruction, foreign body aspiration and massive hemoptysis. Areas covered : This article will review the history, indications, contraindication, technique and complications of rigid bronchoscopy. We will also briefly discuss the methods of anesthesia and ventilation and finally our perspective on the future of rigid bronchoscopy. Expert commentary : Although the rise of flexible bronchoscopy in the 1960s led to a decline in the use of rigid bronchoscopy, the last two decades have witnessed resurgence in its popularity. We anticipate that it will remain an important tool used by interventional pulmonologists for decades to come. We suggest that interventional pulmonologists must have training and develop expertise in this technique",

Its first use in the late nineteenth century by Dr Gustav Killian sparked the growth of pulmonary medicine by giving physicians new insights into airway anatomy [1]. Central airway obstruction (CAO) by tumor and foreign body (FB) aspiration are common problems faced by the interventional pulmonologist. An episode of mechanical airway obstruction occurs in up to 20 -40% of patients with lung cancer [2]. Rigid bronchoscopy continues to be indispensable for the management of CAO and other airway diseases."

Desault (1744 -1795) suggested nasotracheal intubation as a treatment for suffocation and FB aspiration [3]. However, it was not until 1894 when Kirstein in Berlin started to intentionally intubate the larynx with the esophagoscope. He suggested that his experience needed further study, but warned that the lower trachea was a very dangerous place. Rhinolaryngologist, Gustav Killian of Freiburg University attended Kirstein ' s lecture in 1895 at the second Congress of the Southern German Laryngologists in Heidelberg; and began his experiments with the new method [3]. In 1897, Gustav Killian removed a pork bone from the right main stem bronchus of a farmer who had aspirated while eating soup. Dr Killian used a head mirror as an external light source and a 33.5-cm esophagoscope to remove the 11 × 3-mm bone fragment while performing the first documented FB retrieval utilizing bronchoscopy [4]. He made some very early observations of the bronchial anatomy and sparked the growth of bronchoscopy [5]. To grasp the true significance of his achievements, one must consider the fact that at that time most patients fell chronically ill after aspiration of a FB. Many of them developed chronic pneumonia and hemorrhage, which had over a 50% mortality. Even surgical procedures like lobectomy and pneumonectomy were introduced after 1910 [3]."

Over the next few decades, as the flexible bronchoscope saw rapid technological advancements, it became widely popular and the use of rigid bronchoscopy rapidly declined. A 1991 American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) survey showed that only 8% of responders at that time were routinely performing rigid bronchoscopy [5]. By 1999, this number had dropped to only 4% [3]."

The external diameter varies from 9 to 14 mm, the wall thickness ranges from 2 to 3 mm, and the length of the adult rigid bronchoscope is usually 40 cm, while the tracheoscopes are shorter (30 cm).

It allows for lifting of the epiglottis, safer intubation through the vocal cords, dilation of airway strictures, and allows one to ' core ' though an airway lesion to achieve airway patency [8 -10]. Most bronchoscopes are round when viewed in cross section while some are oval. Most bronchoscopes are an empty metallic tube while some have a small internal channel through which the rigid telescope can be passed. Rigid bronchoscopes typically have fenestrations at the distal one third of the bronchoscope to allow for contralateral lung ventilation when the bronchoscope is inserted into a main stem bronchus (Figure 1). On the other hand, the shorter tracheoscopes do not allow for main stem bronchus intubation and therefore, do not have the distal fenestrations seen on the bronchoscope (Figure 2). The proximal end of the bronchoscope varies by manufacturer but typically have several ports to allow passage of the telescope, suction catheters as well as a variety of instruments used for tumor destruction, tumor excision, dilation, and FB removal [11].",

The various methods of ventilation include apneic oxygenation, spontaneous assisted ventilation, controlled ventilation (closed system), manual jet ventilation and high-frequency jet ventilation [14]. The most common technique in the 1990s was the use of spontaneous assisted ventilation with intravenous anesthesia. However, the high-risk patient population suffering from CAO suffered frequent episodes of hypoxemia with this strategy. This has led to a paradigm shift away from this mode over the past two decades [15]. Even in pediatric populations, the use of spontaneous ventilation has been shown to increase the risk of hypoxemia and other complications during rigid bronchoscopy [8]."

            "text": "The need for a mode of ventilation that could provide continuous oxygenation and ventilation; while allowing adequate airway control led to the reemergence of jet venturi ventilation. Sanders originally described this method in 1967 [3]. Low-frequency jet ventilation has been shown to effectively ventilate and oxygenate the patient while keeping the proximal end of the bronchoscope open and free to allow passage of instruments [16,17]. To achieve jet ventilation through an open system, 100% oxygen is injected at 50 psi through one of the operator ports at the proximal end of the bronchoscope. The anesthesiologist manually achieves this by providing jets at a rate of 8 -15 breaths/min, while observing chest rise with each breath to ensure adequate ventilation (Figure 6). Since the jet ventilation system is open to the atmosphere, room air is also entrained into the bronchoscope resulting in a variable FiO2 delivered to the distal airways [18]. Although adequate oxygenation can usually be obtained easily, a limitation of this system is the limited ability to assess minute ventilation and airway pressures, potentially leading to an increased risk of iatrogenic pneumothorax due to dynamic hyperinflation distal to a stenotic airway [18,19].",

The pressure on inspiration resulting from the jet nozzle and room air entrainment reaches a plateau in the working channel at a distance of approximately 10 cm from the proximal end of the bronchoscope. As a result, the inspiratory pressure distal to this point can be taken as being representative of the mean inspiratory pressure. The Hemer bronchoscope has an internal port at 14 cm from the proximal end of the bronchoscope and can be connected to pressure transducers and gas-sensors to monitor end-tidal CO2 [20]. The measuring devices for pressure and breath gas and the jet pressure control are connected via a three-way stopcock and connecting tubes to the luer connector of the measuring tube. When used with the Monsoon high-frequency jet ventilator, ventilation is discontinued if a set pressure limit is exceeded [21]."

The large working channel of the rigid bronchoscope that allows for simultaneous ventilation and introduction of various tools in the airway is extremely valuable in management of CAO [21]. Rigid bronchoscopy is particularly useful for management of most endobronchial pathologies including endobronchial tumor, tracheal or bronchial stenosis, airway obstruction due to FB aspiration, and massive hemoptysis [23]. Rigid bronchoscopy is often also used as an adjunctive technique to allow the use of other endobronchial tools such as laser, photodynamic therapy, and tracheobronchial stents [24].

The beveled edge of the rigid bronchoscope is placed against the base of the tumor, which is then dissected away from the airway wall by gentle forward rotating motion of the rigid bronchoscope. Fragments of excised tumor can then be removed with forceps, cryoprobe, or suction catheter [31]. The rigid bronchoscope can provide immediate tamponade at the base of the tumor minimizing the bleeding, while maintaining adequate ventilation to the contralateral lung (in case of tumor distal to the carina) via side ports. The large channel of the bronchoscope allows for rapid suction of tumor fragments or blood and also adequate space for adjunctive instruments such as laser or APC. A microdebrider can also be used for mechanical debulking of central airway tumors, in particular, tracheal tumors. Although these techniques are easy and effective for endobronchial tumor excision, careful attention must be paid during ' coring ' out a tumor or application of microdebrider to ensure that a correct axis and course is taken. Potential complications are airway wall perforation or vascular injury and these can be life-threatening. When a patient can tolerate lower levels of oxygen, thermal ablation techniques such as laser, electrocautery, and APC can be applied. Complete bronchoscopic resection is feasible in certain airway tumors (e.g. endobronchial hamartoma) without invasion through the airway wall, and bronchoscopy in such cases can often be curative (Figure 7).",

The most common reasons for placement of airway stents are extrinsic compression of the airway from tumor or lymph nodes, to stabilize of airway wall after intraluminal removal of tumor, to restore patency in benign recurrent strictures, to support a symptomatic malacic airway, and to cover and potentially treat a fistula [38]."

            "text": "limitations of the procedure include difficulty in intubation in patients with cervical spine disease, a small range of available bronchoscope sizes, limited space within the bronchoscope, large size of telescopes and certain instruments such as optical forceps, limited reach of rigid optics to proximal airways, need to remove telescope often to clean the lens and to allow introduction of other tools, etc. There is certainly room for more research on the procedural technique and accessory tools to develop innovative methods, which can overcome these limitations."

            "text": "Bronchoscopy, in general, can be diagnostic or therapeutic. Often it is both. It is for therapeutic bronchoscopy where using the rigid technique is particularly important and often necessary. Use of rigid bronchoscopy for CAO makes the procedure not only safer but also more effective and efficient. In fact, in a subset of this population, rigid therapeutic bronchoscopy has been shown to improve survival. FB removal is often done with rigid bronchoscopy and certain FBs can be impossible to remove without it. We believe that every interventional pulmonology fellowship program must provide sufficient training in rigid bronchoscopy such that every interventional pulmonologist has adequate expertise in this procedure. The number of interventional fellowship training programs in the US is rising rapidly. A multi-society interventional pulmonology fellowship accreditation standard has been developed with input and approval of the American Association for Bronchology and Interventional Pulmonology, Association of Interventional Pulmonology Program Directors, American Thoracic Society, ACCP/CHEST, and the Association of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine Program Directors [72]. This will ensure that accredited interventional fellowship programs provide training in rigid bronchoscopy and other procedures that is at par with the established standards."

The basic technique, instruments, and indications of rigid bronchoscopy have been largely unchanged over the past few decades and we anticipate few changes in the near future. With the rapid rise in the number of interventional pulmonology fellowship training programs over the past decade, the number of interventional pulmonologists trained in the use of rigid bronchoscopy is rising rapidly. We anticipate that the incidence of malignant CAO will continue to rise due in part to improving survival of patients with lung cancer and other malignancies metastatic to the airway [73]. It appears that the number of rigid bronchoscopies performed will continue to rise over the next 5 years, in particular, for the management of malignant CAO."

Rigid bronchoscopy is an invaluable tool in the diagnosis and management of several malignant and non-malignant causes of central airway obstruction (CAO) and has become integral after the inception of airway stenting. The management of CAO can be a complicated endeavor with significant risks making the understanding of basic rigid bronchoscopy techniques, ablative technologies, anesthetic care and stenting of utmost importance in the care of these complex patients. This review article will focus on the history of rigid bronchoscopy, the technical aspects of performing a rigid bronchoscopy as well as the use of silicone stents their indications, complications and placement techniques."

        "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to provide an introduction to rigid bronchoscopy (RB). We will briefly discuss its history, evolution, and resurgence while we highlight its versatility and usefulness for today's interventional pulmonologist and thoracic surgeon. Despite being one of the earliest pulmonary procedures described, RB is still an important technique. Advances in thoracic medicine have made this skill critical for a fully functional interventional pulmonary program. If the interventional pulmonologist of this century is to be successful, he or she should be facile in this technique. Despite the availability of RB for decades, the invention of flexible bronchoscopy in 1966 led to a significant downturn in its usage. The growth of the interventional pulmonology field brought RB back into the spot light. Apart from the historic role of RB in treatment of central airway lesions and mechanical debulking of endobronchial lesions, RB is the key instrument that can adapt modern therapeutic tools such as laser, argon plasma coagulation, electrocautery, cryotherapy, and stent deployment. Performing RB requires proper preprocedure preparation, exceptional understanding of upper airway anatomy, specific hand-eye coordination, and open communication between the bronchoscopist and the anesthesiologist. These skills can be primarily learned and maintained with repetition. This article will review information relevant to this technique and lay a foundation to be built upon for years to come."

        "abstract": "Rigid bronchoscopy, a procedure more than 100 years old, now has been performed in three centuries. The \"open tube\" bronchoscope provides safe access to the lower airways and has proved to be compatible with newer, more sophisticated therapies as they have been introduced into the practice of bronchology. The twenty-first century surely will provide the bronchoscopist with exciting new diagnostic and therapeutic tools for the management of lung diseases, and it is likely that the rigid bronchoscope will continue to play an important role in delivering these tools to the airways. Pulmonologists need to appreciate the use of this classic instrument and prevent rigid bronchoscopy from becoming a forgotten art."

The rigid and flexible bronchoscope are both used for diagnostic and increasingly for therapeutic procedures; for the therapeutic procedures the term 'interventional bronchoscopy' has been coined. Apart from the more traditional indications for interventional bronchoscopies, such as aspiration of secretions and removal of foreign bodies, the treatment of inoperable stenoses of the central airways--benign or malignant--has moved to the center stage of interventional endoscopies. This review focuses on the technique and indication of the following procedures: bronchial toilette, foreign body removal, dilatation, diathermy, cryotherapy, photodynamic therapy, laser resection, brachytherapy and the insertion of stents (endoprostheses)."

First, answers to some of the questions, particularly those pertaining to complication rates, rely on the memory of participants. Second, the wording of certain questions may have imparted different meanings. Third, the format of the questionnaire may have confused some. Fourth, one cannot expect that all questionnaires will be answered fully. Fifth, as indicated by several respondents, several important topics (eg, topical anesthetic agents and mode of their delivery, prophylaxis against infective endocarditis, tracheobronchial stent placement, endobronchial intraluminal radiotherapy) were not included. Many respondents suggested inclusion of these and other questions in future surveys. Nevertheless, in the absence of any survey looking into a large number of bronchoscopy-related practices, mail surveys have the advantage of reflecting nationwide practice rather than results from selected centers, and this report provides some insight into bronchoscopy practices in North America. While the results indicate the present trends in bronchoscopy practices in North America, they do not establish or recommend any standards in bronchoscopy."

A growing armamentarium of diagnostic and therapeutic tools has expanded the interventional pulmonologist's ability to care for pulmonary patients with complex abnormalities, often in concert and close collaboration with physicians in other specialties, such as thoracic surgery. Innovative technologies promise to have an impact on diseases and clinical entities not traditionally treated by invasive pulmonary interventions, such as asthma, COPD, and the solitary pulmonary nodule. Training, credentialing, reimbursement, and scientific validation remain key necessities for the continued growth of IP, and require a concerted effort by chest physicians and their professional organizations."

The experience base for this review is more than 100 patients between 1989 and 2001 who have been anaesthetized for stent insertion. Early cases required rigid bronchoscopy for the routine of insertion. Anaesthetic techniques have evolved from those that were designed and developed for laser surgery in the central airways. The advent of modern devices now extends the variety of anaesthetic management techniques that can be used. But the original one, based on the requirement for use of a rigid bronchoscope, is best for dealing with complications and extracting problem stents. The most frequent complication of the processes of stent insertion has been respiratory failure because of carbon dioxide retention, consequent on obstruction with secretions in the area of the carina. The nature of central airway problems suggests that anaesthesia induction, management and teaching should not be founded on the conventional model-base of upper airway obstruction."

        "abstract": "Due to growing interest in management of central airway obstruction, rigid bronchoscopy is undergoing a resurgence in popularity among pulmonologists. Performing rigid bronchoscopy requires use of deep sedation or general anesthesia to achieve adequate patient comfort, whereas maintaining oxygenation and ventilation via an uncuffed and often open rigid bronchoscope requires use of ventilation strategies that may be unfamiliar to most pulmonologists. Available approaches include apneic oxygenation, spontaneous assisted ventilation, controlled ventilation, manual jet, and high-frequency jet ventilation. Anesthetic technique is partially dictated by the selected ventilation strategy but most often relies on a total intravenous anesthetic approach using ultra-short-acting sedatives and hypnotics for a rapid offset of action in this patient population with underlying respiratory compromise. Gas anesthetic may be used with the rigid bronchoscope, minimizing leaks with fenestrated caps placed over the ports, although persistent circuit leaks can make this approach challenging. Jet ventilation, the most commonly used ventilatory approach, may be delivered manually using a Sanders valve or via an automated ventilator at supraphysiologic respiratory rates, allowing for an open rigid bronchoscope to facilitate ease of moving tools in and out of the airway. Despite a patient population that often suffers from significant respiratory compromise, major complications with rigid bronchoscopy are uncommon and are similar among modern ventilation approaches. Choice of ventilation technique should be determined by local expertise and equipment availability. Appropriate patient selection and recognition of limitations associated with a given ventilation strategy are critical to avoid procedural-related complications."

        "abstract": "Central airway obstruction is a problem facing all medical and surgical subspecialists caring for patients with chest diseases. The incidence of this disorder appears to be rising because of the epidemic of lung cancer; however, benign causes of central airway obstruction are being seen more frequently as well. The morbidity is significant and if left untreated, death from suffocation is a frequent outcome. Management of these patients is difficult, but therapeutic and diagnostic tools are now available that are beneficial to most patients and almost all airway obstruction can be relieved expeditiously. This review examines current approaches in the workup and treatment of patients suffering from airway impairment. Although large, randomized, comparative studies are not available, data show significant improvement in patient outcomes and quality of life with treatment of central airway obstruction. Clearly, more studies assessing the relative utility of specific airway interventions and their impact on morbidity and mortality are needed. Currently, the most comprehensive approach can be offered at centers with expertise in the management of complex airway disorders and availability of all endoscopic and surgical options."

        "abstract": "Lower airway obstruction usually causes a remarkable reduction in the quality of life in cases of both benign and malignant tracheobronchial intraluminal tumor growth. Often this growth can also lead to premature death because of ventilation failure or, indirectly, because of fatal infections. In combination with external radiation therapy, laser surgery has become a standard means of treatment for these patients. From 1987-1999, 102 patients were treated with 270 laser treatment sessions (89 for malignant and 13 for benign diseases) at Turku University Hospital. Treatment was performed mostly with a combination of CO(2)-Nd:YAG laser via a rigid bronchoscope but also with a CO(2) laser and fiberoptic Nd:YAG laser. The treatment was considered successful in 208 cases of 270 treatment sessions (77%). The most important single factor affecting the success of the therapy was the unfavorable location of the tumor (40 cases). In these cases, the tumor was either located too distally in the bronchial tree, or the airway obstruction was found to be caused by extraluminal compression. There were two fatal complications (0.8%). Other complications affecting the quality of the procedure were minor intraoperative bleeding in 7.4% (20/270) and intraoperative ventilation problems in 7.0% (19/270). The 1-year survival of the patients with malignant disease was 37.1% (33/89), the 2-year survival 20.2% (18/89) and the 5-year survival 9.0% (8/89). Laser treatment is an effective method in maintaining tracheobronchial ventilation as a palliative treatment modality. Serious complications are possible, but considering the fatal nature of the disease, laser treatment can be recommended. In cases of benign diseases, endobronchial laser treatment was also very successful."

A complete resection is required to potentially improve survival of these patients. Lobectomy is the minimum resection of choice. En bloc resections of involved adjacent organs and structures are performed routinely with acceptable morbidity and mortality. Mediastinal lymph node dissection allows accurate surgical and pathologic staging of lymph node disease but has yet to be proven efficacious as a curative procedure. The standard approach to the hemithorax is via posterolateral thoracotomy. Recent muscle-sparing incisions and video-assisted techniques have been employed safely to accomplish goals of surgery. This article evaluates past and current approaches to the resection of NSCLC, and looks at the impact of route and extent of resection on survival of NSCLC patients."

This obstruction may be caused by airway edema, smooth muscle constriction, increased secretions, vascular congestion, mass lesions, scarring, or foreign bodies. Stridor is a special kind of wheeze described as a loud musical sound of constant pitch, which is heard in patients with tracheal or laryngeal obstruction. The full differential diagnosis of airway obstruction should be carefully considered in any patient with wheezing or stridor."

Dependable methods have also been developed for laryngotracheal and carinal resection and reconstruction. The daunting problem of long congenital tracheal stenosis appears to be largely solved by slide tracheoplasty. In the past four decades much has also been learned about the etiology, natural history, pathology, and (in some cases) prevention of tracheal diseases including primary and secondary tumors, postintubation injuries, and idiopathic stenosis."

        "abstract": "The optimal management of postintubation tracheal stenosis is not well defined. A therapeutic algorithm was designed by thoracic surgeons, ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeons, anaesthetists and pulmonologists. Rigid bronchoscopy with neodymium-yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd-YAG) laser resection or stent implantation (removable stent) was proposed as first-line treatment, depending on the type of stenosis (web-like versus complex stenosis). In patients with web-like stenoses, sleeve resection was proposed when laser treatment (up to three sessions) failed. In patients with complex stenoses, operability was assessed 6 months after stent implantation. If the patient was judged operable, the stent was removed and the patient underwent surgery if the stenosis recurred. This algorithm was validated prospectively in a series of 32 consecutive patients. Three patients died from severe coexistent illness shortly after the first bronchoscopy. Of the 15 patients with web-like stenosis, laser resection was curative in 10 (66%). Among the 17 patients with complex stenoses, three remained symptom-free after stent removal. Bronchoscopy alone was thus curative in more than one-third of the patients. Six patients underwent surgery, two after failure of laser resection and four after failure of temporary stenting. Surgery was always performed with the patient in good operative condition. Palliative stenting was the definitive treatment in nine cases. Tracheostomy was the definitive solution in two cases. This approach, including an initial conservative treatment, depending on the type of the stenosis, appears to be applicable to almost all patients and allows secondary surgery to be performed with the patient in good condition."

The management of these airway complications has relied heavily on stent placement that usually involves the use of a rigid bronchoscope and is a relatively complicated procedure in the patient requiring mechanical ventilation. Another has been the use of laser therapy in selected patients. We report three cases of postoperative bronchostenosis managed with bronchoscopically directed balloon dilatation. This relatively simple procedure performed under local anesthesia using a fiberoptic bronchoscope and a modification of the Seldinger technique for balloon placement permitted accurate and atraumatic dilatation of significant posttransplant stenosis. This technique may have potential for emergency and/or palliative management of postoperative, posttraumatic, or malignant airway obstruction."

Interventional bronchoscopic procedures have been reported to be of help in weaning patients with malignant airway stenoses from mechanical ventilation, whereas their use in benign disease is only anecdotal. The objectives of this study are to evaluate early, intermediate and long-term outcome of interventional bronchoscopy and stent placement in the treatment of MV/AA dependency due to benign airway obstruction. In a retrospective cohort analysis for the period 1999-2004, we evaluated 15 consecutive ICU patients with documented benign central airway obstruction, who were referred for bronchoscopic management of their condition after multiple failed attempts at weaning from MV or decannulation of the AA. Indications for bronchoscopic treatment were surgery refusal, medical or surgical inoperability, or absence of alternative treatment options. Malacia, post-intubation stenosis and goiter were the main causes of airway obstruction and MV/AA dependency. All patients were treated by means of rigid bronchoscopy, dilatation procedures and stent insertion. All but one patient (93.3%) were successfully and permanently extubated/decanulated immediately after the bronchoscopy. Minor complications occurred in 6 patients (40%) leading to a second intervention. All complications could be managed endoscopically and long-term follow up was uneventful. Interventional bronchoscopy with stent insertion can allow successful withdrawal from MV/AA and can offer longstanding airway patency in selected ventilator- or tracheostomy-dependant individuals with benign airway stenoses,when surgery in not feasable or contra-indicated."

It requires early recognition and treatment by rigid bronchoscopy to avoid fatal outcomes. <i>Objective.</i> The aim of this study was to study the pattern of FBA in the tracheobronchial tree as well as the success rate of rigid bronchoscopy in children admitted to a single center and to analyze the relationship of the type of foreign body (FB) with patients' age, presentation, and complications. <i>Methods.</i> A retrospective cross-sectional study of FBA was conducted in children in the Sulaimani/Kurdistan region, Iraq, admitted to the emergency teaching hospital of the University of Sulaimani from January 2014 to March 2016. <i>Result.</i> Data of 83 patients between 6 months and 15 years old were studied. The most affected was the 1- to 5-year-old group. There was a slight female predominance (male to female ratio 0.93:1). The most common FB was sunflower seed (49.4%). History of choking was present in 92.8% of patients; 55.4% had normal air entry, and 37.3% had no added sound on chest auscultation. Normal chest X-ray (CXR) was found in 40% of patients. The most common site was the right bronchial tree (39.8%). Two patients needed mechanical ventilation; both of them died. There was a significant relationship between the type of FB (<i>P</i> = .013, .000, respectively). <i>Conclusion.</i> Medical history is the most important factor for reaching the diagnosis; bronchoscopy is mandatory if choking was witnessed, even if examination and CXR are normal. Organic material causes more local reaction than nonorganic material."

The most common symptoms are choking followed by a protracted cough. Physical examination findings include fever, stridor, retractions, and decreased breath sounds. Radiographic imaging can be helpful if the object aspirated is radiopaque or if there are signs of hyperexpansion on expiration. Negative-imaging studies, however, do not exclude the presence of a foreign body in the airway. The longer a foreign body resides in the airway, the more likely it is to migrate distally. When this occurs, symptoms of chronic cough and wheezing may mimic an asthmalike condition. Bronchoscopy is indicated in this situation to evaluate the airway thoroughly. If a foreign body is present, extraction can be performed with flexible or rigid bronchoscopy. If flexible bronchoscopy is attempted, it is imperative that the bronchoscopist is familiar with rigid bronchoscopy and has the equipment immediately available should danger to the airway occur. The procedure is generally safe and well tolerated. Many patients are managed under general anesthesia, but foreign bodies often can be removed with a flexible bronchoscope with the patient under local anesthesia. Surgery should be performed only as a last resort and rarely is necessary."

        "abstract": "Foreign body aspiration is a leading cause of death in children 1-3 years old, although mortality is low for children who reach the hospital. Presenting symptoms of an inhaled foreign body depends on time since aspiration. Immediately after inhalation the child starts to cough, wheeze, or have laboured breathing. If the early signs are missed, the child usually presents with fever and other signs and symptoms of chest infection. A plain chest X-ray has relatively low sensitivity and specificity for inhaled foreign body. The gold standard for diagnosis and management of this condition is rigid open tube bronchoscopy under general anaesthesia. For late presentations, time should be taken to fast the child and complete a thorough evaluation before bronchoscopy. The procedure should be performed in a well-equipped room with at least two anaesthesiologists, one with paediatric experience, in attendance. Most experienced anaesthesiologists prefer inhalational rather than intravenous induction of anaesthesia and a ventilating bronchoscope rather than intubation. Equally good results have been reported with spontaneous ventilation or positive pressure ventilation; jet ventilation is not advocated for foreign body removal in children."

From November 1978 to June 2010 we performed 9950 interventional endoscopies among which 20% were performed in an emergency context. To obtain a homogeneous study group, we reviewed the last four years. 344 interventional emergency endoscopies were done for the following indications: cancers (n=240, 70%), iatrogenic stenosis (n=63, 18%), foreign bodies (n=29, 8.5%), hemoptysis (12, 3.5%). The same technique was used in all cases: operating room, general anesthesia, rigid bronchoscope, laser, cryotherapy. Outcome was favorable in 85% of cancers and 100% in all other indications. Apart from clear-cut cases, it remains difficult to define the true emergency. Whatever the definition retained, a well-trained anesthetic and endoscopic team is crucial for proper intervention in these potentially life-threatening situations."

Although massive hemoptysis accounts for only 5-15% of episodes, it should always be considered as a life-threatening condition that warrants effective assessment and management. In this article, we review the literature with regard to the definition, etiology, epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of massive hemoptysis, with special emphasis on the role of bronchoscopy as a diagnostic and therapeutic tool. We briefly present the circumstances under which the use of rigid bronchoscopy should be preferred for controlling massive bleeding. Moreover, we address the crucial importance of multidisciplinary collaboration by illustrating the roles of endovascular therapy and surgery in the optimal management of massive hemoptysis."

        "abstract": "Major hemoptysis a potentially life-threatening condition in pulmonology and can originate from both identifiable and unidentifiable sites. Identifiable bleeding sites can be controlled locally by iced saline, vasopressors, laser, electrocautery and balloon tamponade. Bleeding from an unidentifiable source, on the other hand, is much more difficult to control as the bleeding site is not accessible by the bronchoscope. Tranexamic acid (TA), a synthetic anti-fibrinolytic agent, is approved for treatment or prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in hemophilia or following major operative procedures via intravenous or oral routes. Its efficacy in controlling bleeding from mucosal tissue led us to apply it to patients with pulmonary bleeding. Six patients with significant hemoptysis, two who bled during bronchoscopy biopsy and four with spontaneous bleeding (lung cancer, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, idiopathic pulmonary bleeding, metastatic thyroid carcinoma) were treated with TA. For the two who bled during bronchoscopy, we used a bolus of 500mg/5mL through the bronchoscope working channel, while the latter four received aerosolized TA 500mg/5ml 3-4 times a day. In all cases, the bleeding stopped with the first dose of TA, and the treatment was well tolerated without adverse events. While limited due to the small number of patients, these data show that TA administered either as a bolus through the bronchoscope or via inhalation seems to be effective in controlling severe hemoptysis from both identifiable and unidentifiable bleeding sites. Further clinical studies are needed to evaluate the use of the TA in this set-up."

In the last 10 years, formal IP fellowships have increased substantially in number from five to now &gt; 30. The vast majority of IP fellowship trainees are selected through the National Resident Matching Program, and validated in-service and certification examinations for IP exist. Practice standards and training guidelines for IP fellowship programs have been published; however, considerable variability in the environment, curriculum, and experience offered by the various fellowship programs remains, and there is currently no formal accreditation process in place to standardize IP fellowship training. Recognizing the need for more uniform training across the various fellowship programs, a multisociety accreditation committee was formed with the intent to establish common accreditation standards for all IP fellowship programs in the United States. This article provides a summary of those standards and can serve as an accreditation template for training programs and their offices of graduate medical education as they move through the accreditation process."

It has an operator head with a universal instrumentation barrel that can be placed on the proximal end of bronchial or tracheal tube of any size. It also has three side ports for instruments, ventilation, and anesthesia. This innovative design allows the operator to use various endoscopic tools, suction catheters, and laser fibers simultaneously, without losing visualization. The Bryan-Dumon stent placement kit is available for the placement of silicone tracheobronchial stents. The stent placement kits have steel stent introducers and pushers that allow for loading of the Y stent in a musketbarrel type fashion. These kits are color-coded corresponding to the color-coded bronchial and tracheal tubes of the Series II Rigid Bronchoscope (Figure 3).",

One big advantage of using rigid bronchoscopy for dilation is the ability to maintain a safe airway with continued ventilation that is not possible when using a balloon or bougie for dilation. The rigid bronchoscope or tracheoscope is particularly useful for management of subglottic or tracheal stenosis. The beveled end of the rigid bronchoscope can help support the floppy posterior membrane while using the balloon for dilation such that adequate radial force from the balloon is directed toward the stiffer anterolateral walls of the trachea. Moreover, the rigid tracheoscope allows for optimal ventilation, repeated access, and quick dilation in this difficult location.",

Silicone stents typically require rigid bronchoscopy for placement (Figure 8) [45]. In cases of benign airway disease requiring stenting, particularly in cases of tracheal stenosis, silicone stents should be considered first [46]. Rigid bronchoscopy is also particularly useful during T-tube placement in subglottic or tracheal stenosis [4].",

Similarly, just like other invasive procedures, risks and benefits of rigid bronchoscopy should be carefully weighed in patients with coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia. In patients with facial injuries or cervical spine disorders, rigid bronchoscopy can be difficult (cervical spine fusion, facial injuries) or unsafe (cervical spine instability).",
          "imitations of the procedure include difficulty in intubation in patients with cervical spine disease, a small range of available bronchoscope sizes, limited space within the bronchoscope, large size of telescopes and certain instruments such as optical forceps, limited reach of rigid optics to proximal airways, need to remove telescope often to clean the lens and to allow introduction of other tools, etc. There is certainly room for more research on the procedural technique and accessory tools to develop innovative methods, which can overcome these limitations."

It also has three side ports for instruments, ventilation, and anesthesia. This innovative design allows the operator to use various endoscopic tools, suction catheters, and laser fibers simultaneously, without losing visualization. The Bryan-Dumon stent placement kit is available for the placement of silicone tracheobronchial stents. The stent placement kits have steel stent introducers and pushers that allow for loading of the Y stent in a musketbarrel type fashion. These kits are color-coded corresponding to the color-coded bronchial and tracheal tubes of the Series II Rigid Bronchoscope (Figure 3).",

One big advantage of using rigid bronchoscopy for dilation is the ability to maintain a safe airway with continued ventilation that is not possible when using a balloon or bougie for dilation. The rigid bronchoscope or tracheoscope is particularly useful for management of subglottic or tracheal stenosis. The beveled end of the rigid bronchoscope can help support the floppy posterior membrane while using the balloon for dilation such that adequate radial force from the balloon is directed toward the stiffer anterolateral walls of the trachea. Moreover, the rigid tracheoscope allows for optimal ventilation, repeated access, and quick dilation in this difficult location.",

Silicone stents typically require rigid bronchoscopy for placement (Figure 8) [45]. In cases of benign airway disease requiring stenting, particularly in cases of tracheal stenosis, silicone stents should be considered first [46]. Rigid bronchoscopy is also particularly useful during T-tube placement in subglottic or tracheal stenosis [4].",

Similarly, just like other invasive procedures, risks and benefits of rigid bronchoscopy should be carefully weighed in patients with coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia. In patients with facial injuries or cervical spine disorders, rigid bronchoscopy can be difficult (cervical spine fusion, facial injuries) or unsafe (cervical spine instability).",
          "imitations of the procedure include difficulty in intubation in patients with cervical spine disease, a small range of available bronchoscope sizes, limited space within the bronchoscope, large size of telescopes and certain instruments such as optical forceps, limited reach of rigid optics to proximal airways, need to remove telescope often to clean the lens and to allow introduction of other tools, etc. There is certainly room for more research on the procedural technique and accessory tools to develop innovative methods, which can overcome these limitations."

          "). On the other hand, the shorter tracheoscopes do not allow for main stem bronchus intubation and therefore, do not have the distal fenestrations seen on the bronchoscope (Figure 2). The proximal end of the bronchoscope varies by manufacturer but typically have several ports to allow passage of the telescope, suction catheters as well as a variety of instruments used for tumor destruction, tumor excision, dilation, and FB removal [11]."

Broyles and Hopkins introduced the telescope optic, optical forceps and improved lighting and imaging in 1940s and 1950s [3].",
          "ulmonologist new tools to advance the field. The BryanDumon ™ series II Rigid Bronchoscope was the first major modification to the rigid bronchoscope since the time of Gustav Killian. It has an operator head with a universal instrumentation barrel that can be placed on the proximal end of bronchial or tracheal tube of any size. It also has three side ports for instruments, ventilation, and anesthesia. This innovative design allows the operator to use various endoscopic tools, suction catheters, and laser fibers simultaneously, without losing visualization. The Bryan-Dumon stent placement kit is available for the placement of silicone tracheobronchial stents. The stent placement kits have steel stent introducers and pushers that allow for loading of the Y stent in a musketbarrel type fashion. These kits are color-coded corresponding to the color-coded bronchial and tracheal tubes of the Series II Rigid Bronchoscope (Figure 3).",

As the vocal cords are approached, the bronchoscope is rotated 90° clockwise such that the beveled end lies between the cords as it is passed through them. The bronchoscope is advanced in a rotating motion to beyond the level of the cricoid cartilage. The beveled tip is allowed to rest on the posterior wall of the trachea.",

          "alignant CAO, balloon dilation has been shown to be effective in the management of nonmalignant airway stenosis as with lung transplantation or post-intubation tracheal stenosis [31]. One big advantage of using rigid bronchoscopy for dilation is the ability to maintain a safe airway with continued ventilation that is not possible when using a balloon or bougie for dilation. The rigid bronchoscope or tracheoscope is particularly useful for management of subglottic or tracheal stenosis. The beveled end of the rigid bronchoscope can help support the floppy posterior membrane while using the balloon for dilation such that adequate radial force from the balloon is directed toward the stiffer anterolateral walls of the trachea. Moreover, the rigid tracheoscope allows for optimal ventilation, repeated access, and quick dilation in this difficult location.",

Silicone stents typically require rigid bronchoscopy for placement (Figure 8) [45]. In cases of benign airway disease requiring stenting, particularly in cases of tracheal stenosis, silicone stents should be considered first [46]. Rigid bronchoscopy is also particularly useful during T-tube placement in subglottic or tracheal stenosis [4].",
          "hould be thoroughly assessed preoperatively just like before any other procedure requiring general anesthesia. Similarly, just like other invasive procedures, risks and benefits of rigid bronchoscopy should be carefully weighed in patients with coagulopathy or thrombocytopenia. In patients with facial injuries or cervical spine disorders, rigid bronchoscopy can be difficult (cervical spine fusion, facial injuries) or unsafe (cervical spine instability).",
          "imitations of the procedure include difficulty in intubation in patients with cervical spine disease, a small range of available bronchoscope sizes, limited space within the bronchoscope, large size of telescopes and certain instruments such as optical forceps, limited reach of rigid optics to proximal airways, need to remove telescope often to clean the lens and to allow introduction of other tools, etc. There is certainly room for more research on the procedural technique and accessory tools to develop innovative methods, which can overcome these limitations."
