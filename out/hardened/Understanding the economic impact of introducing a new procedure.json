Downstream revenue has been defi  ned by administrators as revenue captured after patients use one hospital service and then use others.

Other diagnostic tools used at MUSC to diagnose lung cancer (eg, CT scan-guided biopsy, other bronchoscopies including navigational procedures, and EUS fi  ne-needle aspiration) were included. To avoid counting collections unrelated to the initial Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA, 180 days after the Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA procedure was felt to be a conservative time period to allow for the measurement  of  downstream  revenue  from  the  procedure, though  clearly  patients  with  a  cancer  diagnosis  could  produce considerable downstream revenue past 180 days. Professional collections  were  recorded  according  to  departments  within  the hospital system, and technical collections were recorded according to the diagnosis-related group (DRG) charge.

A  different  way  to  calculate this would be based on collections per patient ($2.4 million per 97 patients). Both are conservative estimates but further validate the point that investing in  this  technology  was  worth  the  cost.  These  calculations are based on the payer mix from a state-supported academic medical center that likely has a lower percentage of private insurance coverage compared with private health-care institutions. In an employment arrangement like this one, where physicians are fully employed by a hospital system, there is more likely to be a collaborative atmosphere among employed physicians  and  the  hospital  fi  nancial  department.  In  a private hospital system, where physician employment is  separate  from  the  hospital  system,  there  may  be more  barriers  to  obtaining  fi  nancial  information  to make estimates of profi  t from a new procedure. Relatively speaking, the fi  nancial benefi  t to pulmonologists is modest. The technical fee is the same as that for a traditional blind TBNA, and the professional fee is only slightly more. These reimbursement rates are low relative to the procedural time, especially for complete  mediastinal  staging  procedures.  This  represents time away from potentially higher paying endeavors by the pulmonologist, such as critical care time, outpatient collections, or polysomnography interpretation.  In  striking  comparison,  the  fi  nancial  gain  to other services such as medical oncology, radiology, and radiation oncology from an Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA program is large. To reimburse physicians performing Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA in a more equitable way, a future direction may entail revenue sharing, where physicians receive  compensation  in  whole  or  in  part  based on the economic benefi  t of their services (eg, cancer care) to the hospital. Alternatively, local centers of excellence in Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA may develop that maintain the necessary procedural volume to justify purchase of the necessary equipment and avoid duplication of expenses by smaller hospitals."

In order to capitalize on a hospital system's resources to acquire data on local health-care needs, the hospital administration should be involved early. Hospital administrators provide a specifi  c and important set of skills (eg, fi  nancial  analysis,  hospital  budgeting  processes,  development of business pro forma  , identifi  cation of barriers, etc) that can improve a physician's chance of success. Presenting your plan to those making purchasing decisions is best done in tandem with the physician extolling the clinical need and the administrator supporting the fi  nancial viability of the technology. Identify  stakeholders  who  stand  to  gain  and  those  who stand to lose from the introduction of the new technology (eg, cancer center director, division chief, members of the thoracic oncology working group). Engage these individuals early in the process to use their resources and advice (  Table 3  ).",

Modest reimbursement for valuable diagnostic  tools  should  not  dissuade  hospitals  from purchasing  when  downstream  revenue  has  been shown to justify the capital investment. The presence of new and effective technology drew patients to  our  hospital  system  from  outside  the  typical referral base, many of whom stayed in the system and generated  downstream  revenue  similar  to  that  of EPs. We propose that there are also intangible benefi  ts  such  as  marketing for the institution and capturing patients into the system who would otherwise have been treated elsewhere."

        "abstract": "The diagnosis of indeterminate mediastinal lymph nodes, masses, and peripheral pulmonary nodules constitutes a significant challenge. Options for tissue diagnoses include computed tomography-guided percutaneous biopsy, transbronchial fine-needle aspiration, mediastinoscopy, left anterior mediastinotomy, or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery; however, these approaches have both advantages and limitations in terms of tissue yield, safety profile, and cost. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) is a new minimally invasive technique that expands the view of the bronchoscopist beyond the lumen of the airway. There are two EBUS systems currently available. The radial probe EBUS allows for evaluation of central airways, accurate definition of airway invasion, and facilitates the diagnosis of peripheral lung lesions. Linear EBUS guides transbronchial needle aspiration of hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, improving diagnostic yield. This article will review the principles and clinical applications of EBUS, and will highlight the role of this new technology in the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer."

        "abstract": "Accurate staging of lung cancer requires noninvasive and pathologic examination of intrathoracic lymphadenopathy, which determines both the treatment options and prognosis. The gold standard for mediastinal staging has been mediastinoscopy. Other options include video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, blind transbronchial needle aspiration, and endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration. Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) has recently been introduced. Here we report the use of EBUS-TBNA as a diagnostic modality for mediastinal adenopathy and staging modality for lung cancer."

        "abstract": "Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) can reliably sample enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and in practice is mostly used to sample nodes visible on CT or positron emission tomography (PET). Few data are available on the use of endoscopic procedures to stage the mediastinum in clinical stage 1 lung cancer. The aim of the present study was to determine the results of EBUS-TBNA in sampling mediastinal lymph nodes in patients with lung cancer and a radiographically normal mediastinum and no PET activity. From January 2004 to May 2007, patients highly suspicious for NSCLC with CT scans showing no enlarged lymph nodes (no node &gt; 1 cm) and a negative PET finding of the mediastinum underwent EBUS-TBNA. Identifiable lymph nodes at locations 2r, 2L, 4r, 4L, 7, 10r, 10L, 11r, and 11L were aspirated. All patients underwent subsequent surgical staging. Diagnoses based on aspiration results were compared with those based on surgical results. One hundred patients (mean age, 52.4 years; 59 men) were included. After surgery, 97 patients (mean age, 52.9 years; 57 men) had NSCLC confirmed and were included in the analysis. In this group, 156 lymph nodes ranging 5 to 10 mm in size were detected and sampled. Malignancy was detected in nine patients but missed in one patient. Mean diameter of the punctured lymph nodes was 7.9 mm. The sensitivity of EBUS-TBNA for detecting malignancy was 89%, specificity was 100%, and the negative predictive value was 98.9%. No complications occurred. In conclusion, EBUS-TBNA can be used to accurately sample and stage patients with clinical stage 1 lung cancer and no evidence of mediastinal involvement on CT and PET. Potentially operable patients with no signs of mediastinal involvement may benefit from presurgical staging with EBUS-TBNA."

Three different techniques are available and can improve the diagnosing and staging in patients with lung cancer. The clinical application and the diagnostic benefit have been established in a lot of studies compared with conventional radiologic methods and other diagnostic procedures. The role of endosonography is expected to grow in the near future as an important tool. Especially the approaches with EUS-fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) and/or EBUS controlled transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) may be able to replace more invasive methods like mediastinoscopy for evaluating patients with lung cancer."

        "abstract": "Many pathologies of the airway involve the bronchial wall and the parabronchial structures. The view of the endoscopist, however, is limited to the lumen and the internal surface of the airway. Processes within the airway wall and outside the airway can only be assessed by indirect signs. Especially in malignancies, this can be of decisive importance for the fate of the patient. Therefore, expanding the endoscopist's view beyond the airway is essential. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and endobronchial ultrasound-transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) are new diagnostic tools that are available on the market. They have great potential for diagnosis of mediastinal processes and staging of lung cancer. After discovering a lung cancer without extrathoracic metastases, the preoperative mediastinal check-up is of great importance in determining operability. The investigation of a suspected malignant adenopathy justifies a complete examination by mediastinoscopy or mediastinotomy, which are considered gold standards. EBUS-TBNA constitutes the recent evolution of TBNA, a method known for 20 years now but underused. The aim of this review is to highlight to the different techniques and to discuss the results of published trials."

The sensitivity of EBUS-TBNA for detecting malignancy was 92.3%, specificity was 100%, and the negative predictive value was 96.3%. No complications occurred. In conclusion, endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration can accurately sample even small mediastinal nodes, therefore avoiding unnecessary surgical exploration in one out of six patients who have no computed tomography evidence of mediastinal disease. Potentially operable patients with no signs of mediastinal involvement on computed tomography may benefit from pre-surgical endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration and staging."

Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) with transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) is emerging as a safe, minimally invasive tool for the primary diagnosis of mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.

However, a basic capital budgeting analysis based strictly on return from the procedure itself may be overly simplistic and not account for other benefi  ts to the hospital system such as the additional testing, consultations,  new  referrals  into  the  system,  and other procedures related to the initial referral for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA.  12",

A  different  way  to  calculate this would be based on collections per patient ($2.4 million per 97 patients). Both are conservative estimates but further validate the point that investing in  this  technology  was  worth  the  cost.  These  calculations are based on the payer mix from a state-supported academic medical center that likely has a lower percentage of private insurance coverage compared with private health-care institutions. In an employment arrangement like this one, where physicians are fully employed by a hospital system, there is more likely to be a collaborative atmosphere among employed physicians  and  the  hospital  fi  nancial  department.  In  a private hospital system, where physician employment is  separate  from  the  hospital  system,  there  may  be more  barriers  to  obtaining  fi  nancial  information  to make estimates of profi  t from a new procedure. Relatively speaking, the fi  nancial benefi  t to pulmonologists is modest. The technical fee is the same as that for a traditional blind TBNA, and the professional fee is only slightly more. These reimbursement rates are low relative to the procedural time, especially for complete  mediastinal  staging  procedures.  This  represents time away from potentially higher paying endeavors by the pulmonologist, such as critical care time, outpatient collections, or polysomnography interpretation.  In  striking  comparison,  the  fi  nancial  gain  to other services such as medical oncology, radiology, and radiation oncology from an Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA program is large. To reimburse physicians performing Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA in a more equitable way, a future direction may entail revenue sharing, where physicians receive  compensation  in  whole  or  in  part  based on the economic benefi  t of their services (eg, cancer care) to the hospital. Alternatively, local centers of excellence in Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA may develop that maintain the necessary procedural volume to justify purchase of the necessary equipment and avoid duplication of expenses by smaller hospitals.",

A similar technology, EUS, has been shown to generate downstream procedures and professional charges that attenuate the lower reimbursement for a half day of EUS compared with a half day of colonoscopy. 15  It should be noted that unlike Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA,  which  lost  an  additional  technical fee relative to traditional bronchoscopy with TBNA, EUS  still  commands  an  additional  technical  fee reimbursement.",

This may not be the case at other institutions that are far less  likely  to  retain  NPs  referred  for  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA due to the presence of comprehensive medical centers in the close vicinity.",
          "ime demands, skills, and training. In order to capitalize on a hospital system's resources to acquire data on local health-care needs, the hospital administration should be involved early. Hospital administrators provide a specifi  c and important set of skills (eg, fi  nancial  analysis,  hospital  budgeting  processes,  development of business pro forma  , identifi  cation of barriers, etc) that can improve a physician's chance of success. Presenting your plan to those making purchasing decisions is best done in tandem with the physician extolling the clinical need and the administrator supporting the fi  nancial viability of the technology. Identify  stakeholders  who  stand  to  gain  and  those  who stand to lose from the introduction of the new technology (eg, cancer center director, division chief, members of the thoracic oncology working group). Engage these individuals early in the process to use their resources and advice (  Table 3  )."

However, a basic capital budgeting analysis based strictly on return from the procedure itself may be overly simplistic and not account for other benefi  ts to the hospital system such as the additional testing, consultations,  new  referrals  into  the  system,  and other procedures related to the initial referral for Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA.  12",

A  different  way  to  calculate this would be based on collections per patient ($2.4 million per 97 patients). Both are conservative estimates but further validate the point that investing in  this  technology  was  worth  the  cost.  These  calculations are based on the payer mix from a state-supported academic medical center that likely has a lower percentage of private insurance coverage compared with private health-care institutions. In an employment arrangement like this one, where physicians are fully employed by a hospital system, there is more likely to be a collaborative atmosphere among employed physicians  and  the  hospital  fi  nancial  department.  In  a private hospital system, where physician employment is  separate  from  the  hospital  system,  there  may  be more  barriers  to  obtaining  fi  nancial  information  to make estimates of profi  t from a new procedure. Relatively speaking, the fi  nancial benefi  t to pulmonologists is modest. The technical fee is the same as that for a traditional blind TBNA, and the professional fee is only slightly more. These reimbursement rates are low relative to the procedural time, especially for complete  mediastinal  staging  procedures.  This  represents time away from potentially higher paying endeavors by the pulmonologist, such as critical care time, outpatient collections, or polysomnography interpretation.  In  striking  comparison,  the  fi  nancial  gain  to other services such as medical oncology, radiology, and radiation oncology from an Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA program is large. To reimburse physicians performing Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA in a more equitable way, a future direction may entail revenue sharing, where physicians receive  compensation  in  whole  or  in  part  based on the economic benefi  t of their services (eg, cancer care) to the hospital. Alternatively, local centers of excellence in Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA may develop that maintain the necessary procedural volume to justify purchase of the necessary equipment and avoid duplication of expenses by smaller hospitals.",

A similar technology, EUS, has been shown to generate downstream procedures and professional charges that attenuate the lower reimbursement for a half day of EUS compared with a half day of colonoscopy. 15  It should be noted that unlike Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA,  which  lost  an  additional  technical fee relative to traditional bronchoscopy with TBNA, EUS  still  commands  an  additional  technical  fee reimbursement.",

This may not be the case at other institutions that are far less  likely  to  retain  NPs  referred  for  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA due to the presence of comprehensive medical centers in the close vicinity.",
          "ime demands, skills, and training. In order to capitalize on a hospital system's resources to acquire data on local health-care needs, the hospital administration should be involved early. Hospital administrators provide a specifi  c and important set of skills (eg, fi  nancial  analysis,  hospital  budgeting  processes,  development of business pro forma  , identifi  cation of barriers, etc) that can improve a physician's chance of success. Presenting your plan to those making purchasing decisions is best done in tandem with the physician extolling the clinical need and the administrator supporting the fi  nancial viability of the technology. Identify  stakeholders  who  stand  to  gain  and  those  who stand to lose from the introduction of the new technology (eg, cancer center director, division chief, members of the thoracic oncology working group). Engage these individuals early in the process to use their resources and advice (  Table 3  )."

A  different  way  to  calculate this would be based on collections per patient ($2.4 million per 97 patients). Both are conservative estimates but further validate the point that investing in  this  technology  was  worth  the  cost.  These  calculations are based on the payer mix from a state-supported academic medical center that likely has a lower percentage of private insurance coverage compared with private health-care institutions. In an employment arrangement like this one, where physicians are fully employed by a hospital system, there is more likely to be a collaborative atmosphere among employed physicians  and  the  hospital  fi  nancial  department.  In  a private hospital system, where physician employment is  separate  from  the  hospital  system,  there  may  be more  barriers  to  obtaining  fi  nancial  information  to make estimates of profi  t from a new procedure. Relatively speaking, the fi  nancial benefi  t to pulmonologists is modest. The technical fee is the same as that for a traditional blind TBNA, and the professional fee is only slightly more. These reimbursement rates are low relative to the procedural time, especially for complete  mediastinal  staging  procedures.  This  represents time away from potentially higher paying endeavors by the pulmonologist, such as critical care time, outpatient collections, or polysomnography interpretation.  In  striking  comparison,  the  fi  nancial  gain  to other services such as medical oncology, radiology, and radiation oncology from an Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA program is large. To reimburse physicians performing Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA in a more equitable way, a future direction may entail revenue sharing, where physicians receive  compensation  in  whole  or  in  part  based on the economic benefi  t of their services (eg, cancer care) to the hospital. Alternatively, local centers of excellence in Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA may develop that maintain the necessary procedural volume to justify purchase of the necessary equipment and avoid duplication of expenses by smaller hospitals.",
          "nowledge,  this  is  the  fi  rst  study  to  examine  the downstream  fi  nancial  benefi  t  of  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA  to  a hospital system. A similar technology, EUS, has been shown to generate downstream procedures and professional charges that attenuate the lower reimbursement for a half day of EUS compared with a half day of colonoscopy. 15  It should be noted that unlike Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA,  which  lost  an  additional  technical fee relative to traditional bronchoscopy with TBNA, EUS  still  commands  an  additional  technical  fee reimbursement.",

This may not be the case at other institutions that are far less  likely  to  retain  NPs  referred  for  Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA due to the presence of comprehensive medical centers in the close vicinity.",
          "ime demands, skills, and training. In order to capitalize on a hospital system's resources to acquire data on local health-care needs, the hospital administration should be involved early. Hospital administrators provide a specifi  c and important set of skills (eg, fi  nancial  analysis,  hospital  budgeting  processes,  development of business pro forma  , identifi  cation of barriers, etc) that can improve a physician's chance of success. Presenting your plan to those making purchasing decisions is best done in tandem with the physician extolling the clinical need and the administrator supporting the fi  nancial viability of the technology. Identify  stakeholders  who  stand  to  gain  and  those  who stand to lose from the introduction of the new technology (eg, cancer center director, division chief, members of the thoracic oncology working group). Engage these individuals early in the process to use their resources and advice (  Table 3  )."
