    "abstract": "Rigid bronchoscopy is one of the oldest medical techniques used in the respiratory and thoracic /uniFB01 elds. Even though its use declined after the development of /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopy, it has again gained importance with the growth of interventional pulmonology, becoming a critical technique taught as part of the training in this subspecialty. The therapeutic advantages compared to other approaches of thoracic pathologies makes rigid bronchoscopy a primary component in the present and future of interventional pulmonary medicine. Advancements in rigid bronchoscopy continued through the 1960s, but with Shigeto Ikeda ' s invention of the /uniFB02 exible bronchoscope, for the next several decades not much occurred with rigid bronchoscopy except in a few centers around the world, that still use it for therapeutic applications. Although there have been signi /uniFB01 cant improvements in optics, there have only been minor changes to the equipment used in the days of Chevalier Jackson. Currently, there are several manufacturers of rigid bronchoscopes and accessory equipment: Novatech SA (La Ciotat, France), Karl Storz Endoscopy-America, Inc. (El Segundo, CA), Richard Wolf Medical Instruments Corporation (Vernon Hills, IL), and Lymol Medical (Woburn, MA). Despite this, the rigid bronchoscope remains relatively similar to the original instrument, a stainless steel tapered tube with a /uniFB02 ared and beveled distal tip ( ► Figs. 1 and 2 ). Some of the bronchoscopes have different capabilities for light delivery, end-tidal CO2 monitoring, interchangeable introduction tubes, sizes, and accessory introduction, but the basic tool is very similar. The diameter of rigid bronchoscopes ranges from 3 (pediatric) to 18 mm. The size chosen is dependent on the airway it is to be introduced into and the procedure, which is proposed. Rigid bronchoscopelengthsrangefrom33to43cm.Thelength varies by the choice of a bronchial and tracheal rigid broncho- scope (or with different manufacturers, the length of the instrumentation tubes uses for tracheal or bronchial procedures). As would be expected, bronchial tubes are longer and have fenestrations to allow ventilation of the contralateral airway whilethetubetip is inserted into either the right or left mainstem bronchus. Tracheal tubes, on the other hand, are shorter and have no fenestrations ( ► Fig. 3 ). The proximal end of rigid bronchoscopes has a central opening and several side ports that can be used for ventilation, light and imaging, end-tidal CO2 monitoring, and instrumentation. The most common technique for illumination and visualization is often provided by a thin glass rod (telescope) connected to a proximal light source through a /uniFB01 beroptic cable. Other systems of delivering light to the distal end of the scope include prism systems as well as light channels with distal illumination ports. The bronchoscope can be used with direct visualization down the tube, directly through a telescope, or the telescope can be connected to a camera head to provide visualization on a monitor. Rubbercapsareusedonthedifferentproximalportsinorder to minimize air leak when volume ventilation is used or to help hold instruments when open channel jet ventilation is used. Multiple accessory instruments can be used through a rigid bronchoscope. They include large optical biopsy or grasping forceps ( ► Fig. 4 ), suction catheters, and stents through stent deliverysystems.Othersincludelaserandargonplasma /uniFB01 bers, cryotherapy probes, electrocautery systems as well as microdebriders, and dilatation balloons, many of which are sold by manufacturers other than the rigid bronchoscope manufacturers. It is often common to use /uniFB02 exible bronchoscopes through the working channel of the rigid bronchoscope toaccessmoredistalairwaysortoassistwithperformingother endobronchial procedures",

The bleeding source was localised to a lobe in seven cases, and lateralised in the remaining five patients. Five patients had a second haemorrhage during that hospital stay and cold saline lavage again terminated it. Further therapy, either surgical or medical was based on information obtained during the respite from haemorrhage achieved with this technique. There was no hospital mortality in the series."

        "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to provide an introduction to rigid bronchoscopy (RB). We will briefly discuss its history, evolution, and resurgence while we highlight its versatility and usefulness for today's interventional pulmonologist and thoracic surgeon. Despite being one of the earliest pulmonary procedures described, RB is still an important technique. Advances in thoracic medicine have made this skill critical for a fully functional interventional pulmonary program. If the interventional pulmonologist of this century is to be successful, he or she should be facile in this technique. Despite the availability of RB for decades, the invention of flexible bronchoscopy in 1966 led to a significant downturn in its usage. The growth of the interventional pulmonology field brought RB back into the spot light. Apart from the historic role of RB in treatment of central airway lesions and mechanical debulking of endobronchial lesions, RB is the key instrument that can adapt modern therapeutic tools such as laser, argon plasma coagulation, electrocautery, cryotherapy, and stent deployment. Performing RB requires proper preprocedure preparation, exceptional understanding of upper airway anatomy, specific hand-eye coordination, and open communication between the bronchoscopist and the anesthesiologist. These skills can be primarily learned and maintained with repetition. This article will review information relevant to this technique and lay a foundation to be built upon for years to come."

        "abstract": "Palliative airway treatments are essential to improve quality and length of life in lung cancer patients with central airway obstruction. Rigid bronchoscopy has proved to be an excellent tool to provide airway access and control in this cohort of patients. The main indication for rigid bronchoscopy in adult bronchology remains central airway obstruction due to neoplastic or non-neoplastic disease. We routinely use negative pressure ventilation (NPV) under general anaesthesia to prevent intraoperative apnoea and respiratory acidosis. This procedure allows opioid sparing, a shorter recovery time and avoids manually assisted ventilation, thereby reducing the amount of oxygen needed, while maintaining optimal surgical conditions. The major indication for NPV rigid bronchoscopy at our institution has been airway obstruction by neoplastic tracheobronchial tissue, mainly treated by laser-assisted mechanical dissection. When strictly necessary, we use silicone stents for neoplastic or cicatricial strictures, reserving metal stents to cover tracheo-oesophageal fistulae. NPV rigid bronchoscopy is an excellent tool for the endoscopic treatment of locally advanced tumours of the lung, especially when patients have exhausted the conventional therapeutic resources. Laser-assisted mechanical resection and stent placement are the most effective procedures for preserving quality of life in patients with advanced stage cancer."

        "abstract": "Central airway obstruction is a problem facing all medical and surgical subspecialists caring for patients with chest diseases. The incidence of this disorder appears to be rising because of the epidemic of lung cancer; however, benign causes of central airway obstruction are being seen more frequently as well. The morbidity is significant and if left untreated, death from suffocation is a frequent outcome. Management of these patients is difficult, but therapeutic and diagnostic tools are now available that are beneficial to most patients and almost all airway obstruction can be relieved expeditiously. This review examines current approaches in the workup and treatment of patients suffering from airway impairment. Although large, randomized, comparative studies are not available, data show significant improvement in patient outcomes and quality of life with treatment of central airway obstruction. Clearly, more studies assessing the relative utility of specific airway interventions and their impact on morbidity and mortality are needed. Currently, the most comprehensive approach can be offered at centers with expertise in the management of complex airway disorders and availability of all endoscopic and surgical options."

Minimally invasive endobronchial techniques have resulted in symptom control and long-term improvements. The rigid bronchoscope remains the method of choice for the treatment of both benign and malignant central airway obstruction. However, it has limited use if lesions are located in the upper lobes or lung periphery, but significant technological advances allow for effective treatments using the flexible bronchoscope. Rigid and flexible bronchoscopes should be seen as complementary procedures and most cases require the use of both modalities."

        "abstract": "Tracheal stenosis is a potentially life-threatening condition. Tracheostomy and endotracheal intubation remain the commonest causes of benign stenosis, despite improvements in design and management of tubes. Post-tracheostomy stenosis is more frequently encountered due to earlier performance of tracheostomy in the intensive care units, while the incidence of post-intubation stenosis has decreased with application of high-volume, low-pressure cuffs. In symptomatic benign tracheal stenosis the gold standard is surgical reconstruction (often after interventional bronchoscopy). Stenting is reserved for symptomatic tracheal narrowing deemed inoperable, due to local or general reasons: long strictures, inflammation, poor respiratory, cardiac or neurological status. When stenting is decided, silicone stent insertion is considered the treatment of choice in the presence of inflammation and/or when removal is desirable. We inserted tracheal silicone stents (Dumon) under general anaesthesia through rigid bronchoscopy in two patients with benign post-tracheostomy stenosis: a 39-year old woman with failed initial operation, and continuous relapses with proliferation after multiple bronchscopic interventions, and a 20-year old man in a poor neurological status, with a long tracheal stricture involving the subglottic larynx (lower posterior part), and inflamed tracheostomy site tissues (positive for methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus). The airway was immediately re-establish, without complications. At 15- and 10-month follow-up (respectively) there was no stent migration, luminal patency was maintained without: adjacent structure erosion, secretion adherence inside the stents, granulation at the ends. Tracheostomy tissue inflammation was resolved (2(nd) patient), new infection was not noted. The patients maintain good respiratory function and will be evaluated for scheduled stent removal. Silicone stents are removable, resistant to microbial colonization and are associated with minimal granulation. In benign post-tracheostomy stenosis silicone stenting appeared safe and effective in re-stenosis after surgery and multiple bronchoscopic interventions, and in long stenosis, involving the lower posterior subglottic larynx in the presence on inflammation and poor neurological status."

Mitomycin-C (MMC) inhibits fibroblast proliferation and synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins, and thereby modulates wound healing and scarring. MMC application at the time of endoscopic dilation and laser surgery has been suggested to improve outcomes, but this has not been studied in a rigorous manner. This study examines the hypothesis that two topical applications of MMC given 3-6 weeks apart will result in decreased scarring/restenosis of the airway, when compared to a single topical application."

        "abstract": "The optimal management of postintubation tracheal stenosis is not well defined. A therapeutic algorithm was designed by thoracic surgeons, ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeons, anaesthetists and pulmonologists. Rigid bronchoscopy with neodymium-yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd-YAG) laser resection or stent implantation (removable stent) was proposed as first-line treatment, depending on the type of stenosis (web-like versus complex stenosis). In patients with web-like stenoses, sleeve resection was proposed when laser treatment (up to three sessions) failed. In patients with complex stenoses, operability was assessed 6 months after stent implantation. If the patient was judged operable, the stent was removed and the patient underwent surgery if the stenosis recurred. This algorithm was validated prospectively in a series of 32 consecutive patients. Three patients died from severe coexistent illness shortly after the first bronchoscopy. Of the 15 patients with web-like stenosis, laser resection was curative in 10 (66%). Among the 17 patients with complex stenoses, three remained symptom-free after stent removal. Bronchoscopy alone was thus curative in more than one-third of the patients. Six patients underwent surgery, two after failure of laser resection and four after failure of temporary stenting. Surgery was always performed with the patient in good operative condition. Palliative stenting was the definitive treatment in nine cases. Tracheostomy was the definitive solution in two cases. This approach, including an initial conservative treatment, depending on the type of the stenosis, appears to be applicable to almost all patients and allows secondary surgery to be performed with the patient in good condition."

Anaesthetic agents are given both to attenuate the sympathetic response to bronchoscopy and to prevent awareness. Use of the Bispectral index to guide anaesthesia has shown to reduce awareness and improve recovery times from general anaesthesia. We undertook a prospective observational study of BIS values in 50 patients during routine anaesthesia for rigid bronchoscopy. BIS values were found to be between 40-60 during bronchoscopy for only 0.5% of the time (0-11.5%[0-98.7%]), median (interquartile range [range]). Patients had a BIS &lt; 40 for 99.6% (87.9-100%[0-100%]) of the duration of bronchoscopy. We identified one case of possible awareness. Few of our patients undergoing general anaesthesia for rigid bronchoscopy had BIS scores in the suggested range of between 40 and 60. BIS &lt; 40 was more frequent than in previous studies of different surgical populations. There was no difference in the BIS values of patients anaesthetised with intermittent boluses or target controlled infusions of propofol."

        "abstract": "Due to growing interest in management of central airway obstruction, rigid bronchoscopy is undergoing a resurgence in popularity among pulmonologists. Performing rigid bronchoscopy requires use of deep sedation or general anesthesia to achieve adequate patient comfort, whereas maintaining oxygenation and ventilation via an uncuffed and often open rigid bronchoscope requires use of ventilation strategies that may be unfamiliar to most pulmonologists. Available approaches include apneic oxygenation, spontaneous assisted ventilation, controlled ventilation, manual jet, and high-frequency jet ventilation. Anesthetic technique is partially dictated by the selected ventilation strategy but most often relies on a total intravenous anesthetic approach using ultra-short-acting sedatives and hypnotics for a rapid offset of action in this patient population with underlying respiratory compromise. Gas anesthetic may be used with the rigid bronchoscope, minimizing leaks with fenestrated caps placed over the ports, although persistent circuit leaks can make this approach challenging. Jet ventilation, the most commonly used ventilatory approach, may be delivered manually using a Sanders valve or via an automated ventilator at supraphysiologic respiratory rates, allowing for an open rigid bronchoscope to facilitate ease of moving tools in and out of the airway. Despite a patient population that often suffers from significant respiratory compromise, major complications with rigid bronchoscopy are uncommon and are similar among modern ventilation approaches. Choice of ventilation technique should be determined by local expertise and equipment availability. Appropriate patient selection and recognition of limitations associated with a given ventilation strategy are critical to avoid procedural-related complications."

Longer serum elimination half-life of relaxant drug was significantly correlated with longer duration of mechanical ventilation after neuromuscular blockade reversal. Cardiovascular complications were noted in 24 procedures and often required therapeutic intervention. Variables predicting cardiovascular complications included longer duration of GA and increasing age. Perioperative respiratory and cardiovascular complications are common after GA for Nd: YAG laser resection. Short-acting neuromuscular relaxants, careful assessment prior to postoperative extubation, limiting duration of GA and cardiovascular monitoring are recommended when implementing GA for Nd: YAG laser resection of endobronchial tumors."

        "abstract": "Over the past decade, there has been significant advancement in the development/application of therapeutics in thoracic diseases. Ablation methods using heat or cold energy in the airway is safe and effective for treating complex airway disorders including malignant and non-malignant central airway obstruction (CAO) without limiting the impact of future definitive therapy. Timely and efficient use of endobronchial ablative therapies combined with mechanical debridement or stent placement results in immediate relief of dyspnea for CAO. Therapeutic modalities reviewed in this article including electrocautery, balloon dilation (BD), neodymium-doped:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser, argon plasma coagulation (APC), and cryotherapy are often combined to achieve the desired results. This review aims to provide a clinically oriented review of these technologies in the modern era of interventional pulmonology (IP)."

The rigid bronchoscope was used in 1,280 (92 percent) of the treatments, with patients almost always under general anesthesia; 116 (8 percent) treatments were performed with the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope alone, with the use of local anesthesia. In almost all cases of benign tumors and in many carcinoid tumors, the treatment was curative. In genuine nonmalignant tracheal stenoses, laser therapy was curative in 34 out of 81 cases. In malignant tumors, the laser improved airway gauge 92 percent of the time. Cumulative survival was 50 percent (+/- 3 percent) at six months and 26 percent (+/- 3 percent) at one year. Following palliative laser therapy, eight patients with bronchogenic carcinoma appearing to be inoperable did have surgery and ten underwent less extensive surgery than expected. Results confirm the usefulness and safety of this relatively new method in the treatment of obstructive lesions of the tracheobronchial tree."

        "abstract": "Airway stents are indicated to treat symptomatic narrowing or to close fistulas of the central airways. They are generally divided into two types: the silicone stents and the metallic stents. Unlike in malignancies, removability is a major objective of temporary stenting in benign conditions, which poses the challenge of a new rigid bronchoscopic procedure under general anesthesia and stent removal with all its attendant risks and costs. The concept of a biodegradable (BD) stent that could maintain the patency of an airway for a predetermined duration of time is very appealing. These BD stents would gradually degrade and eventually vanish from the airway once they are no longer needed. Such stents are currently an area of intense research. Another very promising concept of drug delivery with such stents is also a very exciting area of current research. The aim of this comprehensive review is to discuss all pertinent available literature on the use of BD materials in various clinical applications and to extensively review all animal and humans trials involving BD airway stents."

Despite the increased adoption of rapid prototyping and additive manufacturing techniques in the health-care field, many physicians lack the technical skill set to use this exciting and useful technology. Additionally, the growth in the 3D printing sector brings an ever-increasing number of 3D printers and printable materials. Therefore, it is important for clinicians to keep abreast of this rapidly developing field in order to benefit. In this Ahead of the Curve, we review the history of 3D printing from its inception to the most recent biomedical applications. Additionally, we will address some of the major barriers to wider adoption of the technology in the medical field. Finally, we will provide an initial guide to 3D modeling and printing by demonstrating how to design a personalized airway prosthesis via 3D Slicer. We hope this information will reduce the barriers to use and increase clinician participation in the 3D printing health-care sector."

In the last 10 years, formal IP fellowships have increased substantially in number from five to now &gt; 30. The vast majority of IP fellowship trainees are selected through the National Resident Matching Program, and validated in-service and certification examinations for IP exist. Practice standards and training guidelines for IP fellowship programs have been published; however, considerable variability in the environment, curriculum, and experience offered by the various fellowship programs remains, and there is currently no formal accreditation process in place to standardize IP fellowship training. Recognizing the need for more uniform training across the various fellowship programs, a multisociety accreditation committee was formed with the intent to establish common accreditation standards for all IP fellowship programs in the United States. This article provides a summary of those standards and can serve as an accreditation template for training programs and their offices of graduate medical education as they move through the accreditation process."
