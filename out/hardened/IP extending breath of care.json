    "abstract": "Interventional pulmonary medicine has developed as a subspecialty focused on the management of patients with complex thoracic disease. Leveraging minimally invasive techniques, interventional pulmonologists diagnose and treat pathologies that previously required more invasive options such as surgery. By mitigating procedural risk, interventional pulmonologists have extended the reach of care to a wider pool of vulnerable patients who require therapy. Endoscopic innovations, including endobronchial ultrasound and robotic and electromagnetic bronchoscopy, have enhanced the ability to perform diagnostic procedures on an ambulatory basis. Therapeutic procedures for patients with symptomatic airway disease, pleural disease, and severe emphysema have provided the ability to palliate symptoms. The combination of medical and procedural expertise has made interventional pulmonologists an integral part of comprehensive care teams for patients with oncologic, airway, and pleural needs. This review surveys key areas in which interventional pulmonologists have impacted the care of thoracic disease through bronchoscopic intervention",

Leveraging minimally invasive techniques, interventional pulmonologists diagnose and treat pathologies that previously required more invasive options such as surgery. By mitigating procedural risk, interventional pulmonologists have extended the reach of care to a wider pool of vulnerable patients who require therapy. Endoscopic innovations, including endobronchial ultrasound and robotic and electromagnetic bronchoscopy, have enhanced the ability to perform diagnostic procedures on an ambulatory basis. Therapeutic procedures for patients with symptomatic airway disease, pleural disease, and severe emphysema have provided the ability to palliate symptoms. The combination of medical and procedural expertise has made interventional pulmonologists an integral part of comprehensive care teams for patients with oncologic, airway, and pleural needs. This review surveys key areas in which interventional pulmonologists have impacted the care of thoracic disease through bronchoscopic intervention."

Fellowship training programs for IP are available following standard American Board of Internal Medicine pulmonary medicine certification. The IP fellowship was recently included in the National Resident Matching Program, and an internal advanced IP certification process is used by some hospitals (1). The field has developed out of necessity given the rapid expansion of diagnostic and therapeutic technologies that have supplanted older techniques. IP physicians are often pivotal members of interdisciplinary teams that include surgical, radiological, oncological, transplant, and general pulmonary doctors, where they provide both procedural and medical insight. While IP is frequently tasked with diagnosing, staging, and treating patients with thoracic malignancies, the scope of practice extends to a wide array of noncancerous diseases including interstitial lung disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pleural and complex airway disease, and persistent bronchopleural fistulas, with further innovations currently under investigation. In this article, we review the current state of the art in IP and outline its major applications. Pleural disease, the care of which can be optimized through subspecialist care, is beyond the scope of this review and the reader is referred to other manuscripts detailing the management of pleural disease (2-6)."

With its excellent safety profile and ability to provide sufficient tissue with small biopsies for in-depth studies including genetic analysis, bronchoscopy often supplants surgical techniques as the first-line procedure in the diagnosis of thoracic disease (7)."

Larger central tracheobronchial airways are adjacent to the mediastinal and hilar structures and accessible to bronchoscopy up to the secondary lobar bronchi. Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) has simplified mediastinal and hilar biopsies through incorporating a linear ultrasound probe (7.5 MHz), which allows visualization of the peri-bronchial structures and real-time guidance for needle aspiration of tissue while avoiding vascular structures ( Figure 1 ).",

Defined as lesions smaller than 3 cm in diameter, nodules are frequently located in the periphery of the lung and beyond the reach of traditional bronchoscopic biopsies. While most lung nodules are benign, clinical and radiographic features cannot distinguish early and potentially curable malignant from benign nodules; tissue confirmation is often required. Though CT-guided transthoracic needle aspiration has a diagnostic yield of > 90% for peripheral lung nodules, it lacks the ability to concomitantly stage the mediastinum and carries a higher risk of iatrogenic complications, including pneumothorax and bleeding, compared to bronchoscopy (20, 21). Furthermore, studies demonstrating a 2.5-times increased risk of ipsilateral pleural recurrence among patients with early-stage disease who have undergone CT-guided transthoracic needle aspiration raise concern for pleural seeding from non-bronchoscopic biopsies (22). However, bronchoscopic biopsies are often technically limited by small airway caliber, where visual feedback is lost, and difficulty directing the sampling instruments to the lesion. Features such as target size, centrality, and the presence of adjacent airways ('bronchus sign') to the target lesion are established predictors of bronchoscopic biopsy success (23, 24). T echnical factors such as intraprocedural deviation of the location of a pulmonary nodule compared to a previously obtained CT scan (CT to body divergence) and sheath stability during sampling challenge the diagnostic yield of bronchoscopic biopsies (25, 26)."

Electromagnetic navigation (EMN) is a guided bronchoscopic technology by which peripheral airways are accessed using a smaller, maneuverable guide sheath that is passed through the working channel of a conventional bronchoscope (27). The patient's tracheobronchial tree is outlined in advance on a preprocedure planning CT and a pathway to the target lesion is designated using special software ( Figure 2 a ). This pathway is then correlated to a 3D electromagnetic field generated around the patient. A 2-mm maneuverable and locatable guided sheath is steered to the target lesion by deflecting the magnetic field and signaling the progress of the sheath along the designated pathway. NAVIGATE,the largest national multicenter trial evaluating EMN, reported results of 1,215 prospectively performed procedures from 29 centers across the United States. This study showed a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for malignancy of 69%, 100%, 100%, and 56%, respectively, with a subsequent decline in diagnostic yield to 73% at 1-year and 68% at 2-year follow-up (23, 28).",

The three commercially available robotic systems (Monarch, Ion, and Galaxy) utilize different approaches for peripheral bronchoscopic guidance including electromagnetic navigation, shape-sensing stabilization, and integration of real-time imaging modalities such as digital tomosynthesis (31-35). The performance characteristics of these modalities have improved the ability to successfully access and sample peripheral lung nodules, especially when using adjunct imaging modalities.

Conventional transbronchial lung biopsies can provide smaller samples that are often insufficient and marred by crush artifact. While surgical biopsies provide sufficient tissue, they carry higher risk, with 30-day mortality rates of 2%, or even higher when done in a nonelective fashion (48). T ransbronchial cryobiopsy has emerged as a middle-ground procedure that can provide larger tissue samples devoid of crush artifact using a safer endoscopic approach. Cryobiopsies are done with a probe that rapidly freezes to GLYPH<0> 89°C and adheres to the adjacent lung parenchyma. Though the diagnostic yield of cryobiopsy is higher than that of conventional transbronchial biopsies, especially for nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, rates of adverse events are also higher, including a 56% risk of moderate to severe bleeding and a pneumothorax rate of 8% (49). Given safety concerns, its use is frequently limited to high-volume centers with local expertise. Oberg et al. have recently described the use of cryobiopsy to increase the diagnostic yield of lung nodule biopsies when performed with robotic-assisted bronchoscopy, demonstrating additional potential utility for bronchoscopic cryobiopsy (50).For the diagnosis of ILDs,integrating genomic gene signatures has shown promise to improve the yield of conventional transbronchial biopsies (51)."

Central airway obstruction can lead to significant shortness of breath, functional limitation, post-obstructive pneumonias, and death by asphyxiation. Therapeutic bronchoscopy can recanalize airways by ablating and debriding obstructing tumors, dilating airway strictures, stenting extrinsically compressed or weakened airways, and removing foreign bodies."

            "text": "The prevalence of malignant central airway obstruction is estimated at 13% of lung cancer patients at the time of diagnosis, with an additional 20-30% of patients developing airway obstruction during the course of their disease. Malignant airway obstruction contributes to mortality in 40% of patients (52, 53). Cancers commonly involving the airway include lung and breast cancer, though a wide variety of tumors including lymphoma and esophageal and thyroid cancer can also involve the airway. Radiation and systemic therapies can control the underlying disease, but the lag to treatment effect may leave patients symptomatic for a prolonged period of time. By taking advantage of a variety of techniques such as lasers and stents, therapeutic bronchoscopy can provide immediate symptom improvement, manage post-obstructive pneumonia and hemoptysis, and palliate symptoms either as a bridge to therapy or definitively when therapeutic options are exhausted. Therapeutic bronchoscopy has been shown to result in discontinuation of mechanical ventilation in a significant percentage of critically ill patients with respiratory failure due to malignant central airway obstruction (54, 55). Therapeutic bronchoscopy may also help delineate tumor from distal atelectasis, helping to more effectively stage patients and provide the most appropriate therapy (56). In a retrospective study, 45 of 75 patients with malignant central airway obstruction gained spirometric improvement after bronchoscopy, subsequently allowing parenchyma-sparing surgery (57). The technical success rate of restoring airway patency declines with time, warranting early consultation with a physician skilled in therapeutic bronchoscopy (58). Unfortunately, chest CTs may miss up to 30% of malignant central airway obstructions, warranting a high level of clinical suspicion for this disease in patients with dyspnea in the appropriate setting (59)."

Silicone stents are modifiable, inexpensive, and easily removed using rigid bronchoscopy. Custom 3D printing technology has enhanced the applicability of silicone stents for the management of aberrant airway anatomy. Metallic stents are often easier to deploy than silicone stents and do not require rigid bronchoscopy. However, these stents are more expensive than their silicone counterparts and removal can be complicated due to epithelialization and stent fracturing.

For patients who may be candidates for surgical management of tracheobronchomalacia, a brief trial of airway stenting may be performed to assess for symptom improvement (67, 68).

The randomized controlled National Emphysema Treatment Trial demonstrated the utility of lobar resection for symptomatic improvement and even survival in patients with upper lobe-predominant disease and reduced baseline exercise capacity (69). However, given surgical concerns for this vulnerable population, alternative approaches such as bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (BLVR) have been developed. In BLVR, one-way valves are placed bronchoscopically to achieve lobar atelectasis in a diseased lobe of the lung, reducing hyperinflation and restoring respiratory mechanics. LIBERATE and EMPROVE were two international randomized controlled trials comparing BLVR to standard of care ( Figure 4 ) (70, 71). Patients randomized to BLVR had improved physiology with improved spirometry and 6-min walk tests. Due to the high post-procedure pneumothorax rates of 25-30%, post-procedure in-hospital observation is required. One study showed a sustained benefit for patients who underwent placement of endobronchial valves at 3-year follow-up (72). BLVR has also been shown to benefit patients with homogeneous disease with where air trapping is profound (residual volumes > 200%) (73). As experience grows with BLVR, additional insights regarding the cardiovascular benefits of reducing hyperinflation are being realized as well, with improvements in cardiac preload and contractility and improved cardiac output (74). Endobronchial valves are also approved for compassionate use in the management of persistent broncho-pleural fistulas, which can often occur postoperatively or result from underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, or infection (75).",

        "abstract": "Interventional pulmonology (IP) is a rapidly evolving subspecialty of pulmonary medicine. In the last 10 years, formal IP fellowships have increased substantially in number from five to now &gt; 30. The vast majority of IP fellowship trainees are selected through the National Resident Matching Program, and validated in-service and certification examinations for IP exist. Practice standards and training guidelines for IP fellowship programs have been published; however, considerable variability in the environment, curriculum, and experience offered by the various fellowship programs remains, and there is currently no formal accreditation process in place to standardize IP fellowship training. Recognizing the need for more uniform training across the various fellowship programs, a multisociety accreditation committee was formed with the intent to establish common accreditation standards for all IP fellowship programs in the United States. This article provides a summary of those standards and can serve as an accreditation template for training programs and their offices of graduate medical education as they move through the accreditation process."

Pleural diseases are common and accounted for 3.4 billion US $ in 2014 US inpatient aggregate charges (HCUPnet data). An institutional clinical pathway (\"pleural pathway\") was implemented in conjunction with a dedicated pleural service. Design, implementation, and outcomes of the pleural pathway (from August 1, 2014, to July 31, 2015) in comparison to a previous era (from August 1, 2013, to July 31, 2014) are described."

The therapeutic decisions for advanced NSCLC require comprehensive profiling of actionable mutations, which is currently considered to be an essential part of the diagnostic process. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of EBUS-TBNA cytology specimen for histological subtyping, molecular profiling of NSCLC by massive parallel sequencing (MPS), as well as for PD-L1 analysis. A retrospective review of 806 EBUS bronchoscopies was performed, resulting in a cohort of 132 consecutive patients with EBUS-TBNA specimens showing NSCLC cells in lymph nodes. Data on patient demographics, radiology features of the suspected tumor and mediastinal engagement, lymph nodes sampled, the histopathological subtype of NSCLC, and performed molecular analysis were collected. The EBUS-TBNA specimen proved sufficient for subtyping NSCLC in 83% and analysis of treatment predictive biomarkers in 77% (MPS in 53%). The adequacy of the EBUS-TBNA specimen was 69% for EGFR gene mutation analysis, 49% for analysis of ALK rearrangement, 36% for ROS1 rearrangement, and 33% for analysis of PD-L1. The findings of our study confirm that EBUS-TBNA cytology aspirate is appropriate for diagnosis and subtyping of NSCLC and largely also for treatment predictive molecular testing, although more data is needed on the utility of EBUS cytology specimen for MPS and PD-L1 analysis."

There are no universally accepted measures to determine if each diagnostic criterion has been satisfied; therefore, the diagnosis of sarcoidosis is never fully secure.<b>Methods:</b> Systematic reviews and, when appropriate, meta-analyses were performed to summarize the best available evidence. The evidence was appraised using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach and then discussed by a multidisciplinary panel. Recommendations for or against various diagnostic tests were formulated and graded after the expert panel weighed desirable and undesirable consequences, certainty of estimates, feasibility, and acceptability.<b>Results:</b> The clinical presentation, histopathology, and exclusion of alternative diagnoses were summarized. On the basis of the available evidence, the expert committee made 1 strong recommendation for baseline serum calcium testing, 13 conditional recommendations, and 1 best practice statement. All evidence was very low quality.<b>Conclusions:</b> The panel used systematic reviews of the evidence to inform clinical recommendations in favor of or against various diagnostic tests in patients with suspected or known sarcoidosis. The evidence and recommendations should be revisited as new evidence becomes available."

If nonsurgical biopsy techniques are considered, deciding between bronchoscopic transbronchial versus computed tomography-guided transthoracic biopsy can be difficult. The former has a low diagnostic yield with a low complication risk, whereas the latter has a better diagnostic yield but a higher complication rate. Investigators have looked at various lesion characteristics that can predict the diagnostic yield of guided bronchoscopic biopsies. Although consensus exists that larger size and proximity to the hilum increase the diagnostic yield, there is ongoing debate about the association between computed tomography bronchus sign (air-filled bronchus in close proximity of the lesion as seen on computed tomography imaging) and the diagnostic yield of guided bronchoscopic modalities."

        "abstract": "The field of interventional pulmonology (IP) has grown from a fringe subspecialty utilized in only a few centers worldwide to a standard component in advanced medical centers. IP is increasingly recognized for its value in patient care and its ability to deliver minimally invasive and cost-effective diagnostics and treatments. This article will provide an in-depth review of advanced bronchoscopic technologies used by IP physicians focusing on pulmonary nodules. While most pulmonary nodules are benign, malignant nodules represent the earliest detectable manifestation of lung cancer. Lung cancer is the second most common and the deadliest cancer worldwide. Differentiating benign from malignant nodules is clinically challenging as these entities are often indistinguishable radiographically. Tissue biopsy is often required to discriminate benign from malignant nodule etiologies. A safe and accurate means of definitively differentiating benign from malignant nodules would be highly valuable for patients, and the medical system at large. This would translate into a greater number of early-stage cancer detections while reducing the burden of surgical resections for benign disease. There is little high-grade evidence to guide clinicians on optimal lung nodule tissue sampling modalities. The number of novel technologies available for this purpose has rapidly expanded over the last decade, making it difficult for clinicians to assess their efficacy. Unfortunately, there is a wide variety of methods used to determine the accuracy of these technologies, making comparisons across studies impossible. This paper will provide an in-depth review of available data regarding advanced bronchoscopic technologies."

Limitations in existing guided bronchoscopy platforms has led to developments in robotic assisted technologies. These devices may allow the bronchoscopist to more precisely maneuver the scope and instruments into the periphery of the lungs under direct visualization while also ensuring stability during sampling of the target lesions. These devices have the potential to improve the diagnostic yield in sampling peripheral lung lesions and may play a role in the treatment of non-operable or oligometastatic peripheral tumors using bronchoscopic ablative therapies. In this article, we review the existing robotic bronchoscopy technologies and summarize the available pre-clinical and clinical data supporting their use."

In the past, flexible bronchoscopy was commonly performed for this purpose but its diagnostic yield is suboptimal. This has led to the development of new bronchoscopic modalities such as radial endobronchial ultrasound (R-EBUS), electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) and virtual bronchoscopy (VB). We performed this meta-analysis using data from previously published R-EBUS studies, to determine its diagnostic yield and other performance characteristics. Ovid MEDLINE and PubMed databases were searched for R-EBUS studies in September 2016. Diagnostic yield was calculated by dividing the number of successful diagnoses by the total number of lesions. Meta-analysis was performed using MedCalc (Version 16.8). Inverse variance weighting was used to aggregate diagnostic yield proportions across studies. Publication bias was assessed using funnel plot and Duval and Tweedie's test. 57 studies with a total of 7872 lesions were included in the meta-analysis. These were published between October 2002 and August 2016. Overall weighted diagnostic yield for R-EBUS was 70.6% (95% CI: 68-73.1%). The diagnostic yield was significantly higher for lesions &gt;2&#x2009;cm in size, malignant in nature and those associated with a bronchus sign on computerized tomography (CT) scan. Diagnostic yield was also higher when R-EBUS probe was within the lesion as opposed to being adjacent to it. Overall complication rate was 2.8%. This is the largest meta-analysis performed to date, assessing the performance of R-EBUS for diagnosing PPLs. R-EBUS has a high diagnostic yield (70.6%) with a very low complication rate."

A systematic review of published literature evaluating radial probe EBUS accuracy was performed to determine point sensitivity and specificity, and to construct a summary receiver-operating characteristic curve. Sub-group analysis and linear regression was used to identify possible sources of study heterogeneity. 16 studies with 1,420 patients fulfilled inclusion criteria. Significant inter-study variation in EBUS method was noted. EBUS had point specificity of 1.00 (95% CI 0.99-1.00) and point sensitivity of 0.73 (95% CI 0.70-0.76) for the detection of lung cancer, with a positive likelihood ratio of 26.84 (12.60-57.20) and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.28 (0.23-0.36). Significant inter-study heterogeneity for sensitivity was observed, with prevalence of malignancy, lesion size and reference standard used being possible sources. EBUS is a safe and relatively accurate tool in the investigation of PPLs. Diagnostic sensitivity of EBUS may be influenced by the prevalence of malignancy in the patient cohort being examined and lesion size. Further methodologically rigorous studies on well-defined patient populations are required to evaluate the generalisability of our results."

Primary reasons reported for molecular testing failure in lung cancer biopsy specimens include insufficient amount of tumor cells provided and inadequate tissue quality. Robotic bronchoscopy is a new tool enabling peripheral pulmonary lesion sampling; however, diagnostic yield remains imperfect possibly due to the location of nodules adjacent to or outside of the airway. The 1.1-mm cryoprobe is a novel diagnostic tool and accesses tissue in a 360-degree manner, thus potentially sampling eccentric/adjacent lesions. This study examines the diagnostic yield of the cryoprobe compared to standard needle aspiration and forceps biopsy. It additionally evaluates yield for molecular markers in cases of lung cancer."

In a randomized trial of thoracic irradiation +/- chemotherapy (hydroxyurea and CCNU), patterns of failure did not seem to differ by cell type; the largest group was \"death without progression.\" A subsequent clinical trial of thoracic irradiation +/- cranial irradiation permitted a more detailed evaluation. Patients with squamous cell carcinoma had a higher rate of local failure than distant metastasis. Those with small cell carcinoma had a lower local failure rate and a high rate of distant spread. Patients with adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma had the lowest local failure rate, but had a high rate of distant metastasis. In 300 consecutive patients with autopsies, 75 percent with squamous carcinoma died of complications of the thoracic tumor and only one-quarter had extrathoracic dissemination; 30 percent with small cell carcinoma died of local tumor complications and 70 percent had carcinomatosis; 40 percent of patients with adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma died of intrathoracic complications, and 55 percent had distant metastases. Half the patients with small cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma had brain metastases at autopsy. Future clinical trials should emphasize better control of the most common sites of failure."

        "abstract": "Lung cancer is a common disease and is a leading cause of death in many countries. The management of lung cancer is directed by an optimal staging of the tumour. Integrated positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) is an anatomo-metabolic imaging modality that has recently been introduced to clinical practice and combines two different techniques: CT, which provides very detailed anatomic information; and PET, which provides metabolic information. One of the advantages of PET/CT is the improved image interpretation. This improvement can result in the detection of lesions initially not seen on CT or PET, a more precise location of lesions, a better characterisation of the lesion as benign or malignant and a better differentiation between tumour and surrounding structures. Initial studies demonstrate better results for PET/CT in the staging of lung cancer in comparison with PET alone, CT alone or visual correlation of PET and CT. The purpose of the present article is to discuss technical aspects of integrated PET/CT and to attempt to outline how to introduce integrated PET/CT in clinical and daily practice."

Although the management of MCAO is multimodal and interdisciplinary, the task of providing patients with prompt palliation falls increasingly on the shoulders of interventional pulmonologists. While a variety of tools and techniques are available for the management of malignant obstructive lesions, advancements and evolution in this therapeutic venue have been somewhat sluggish and limited when compared with other branches of interventional pulmonary medicine (e.g., the early diagnosis of peripheral lung nodules). Indeed, one pragmatic, albeit somewhat uncharitable, reading of this article's title might suggest a wry smile and shug of the shoulders as to imply that relatively little has changed in recent years. That said, the spectrum of interventions for MCAO continues to expand, even if at a less impressive clip. Herein, we present on MCAO and its endoscopic and nonendoscopic management-that which is old, that which is new, and that which is still on the horizon."

For patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer, photodynamic therapy is primarily employed as an endobronchial therapy to definitely treat endobronchial, roentgenographically occult, or synchronous primary carcinomas. As definitive monotherapy, photodynamic therapy is most effective in treating bronchoscopically visible lung cancers &#x2264;1 cm with no extracartilaginous invasion. For patients with advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer, photodynamic therapy can be used to palliate obstructing endobronchial lesions, as a component of definitive multi-modality therapy, or to increase operability or reduce the extent of operation required. A review of the available medical literature detailing all published studies utilizing photodynamic therapy to treat at least 10 patients with non-small cell lung cancer is performed, and treatment recommendations and summaries for photodynamic therapy applications are described."

Malignant airway obstruction usually results from direct involvement of bronchogenic carcinoma, or by extension of carcinomas occurring in the esophagus or the thyroid. External compression from lymph nodes or metastatic disease from other organs can also cause central airway obstruction. Most malignant airway lesions are surgically inoperable due to advanced disease stage and require multimodality palliation, including stent placement. As with any other medical device, stents have significantly evolved over the last 50 years and deserve an in-depth understanding of their true capabilities and complications. Not every silicone stent is created equal and the same holds for metallic stents. Herein, we present an overview of the topic as well as some of the more practical and controversial issues surrounding airway stents. We also try to dispel the myths surrounding stent removal and their supposed use only in central airways. At the end, we come to the long-held conclusion that stents should not be used as first line treatment of choice, but after ruling out the possibility of curative surgical resection or repair."

As the condition spans multiple organ systems with varying aetiologies and acuities, TOF poses unique diagnostic and management challenges to pulmonologists, gastroenterologists and thoracic surgeons alike. Although stents have been a cornerstone in the management of TOF, there exists a large gap in our understanding of their efficacy and precise methodology, making stenting procedure both art and science. TOFs relating to underlying oesophageal or tracheal malignancies require advanced understanding of the airway and digestive tract anatomy, dimensions of the fistula, stent characteristics and types, and the interplay between the oesophageal stent and the airway stent if dual stenting procedure is elected. In this review article, we review the most up-to-date data on risk factors, clinical manifestations, diagnostic approaches, management methods and prognosis. Consequently, this article serves to evaluate current therapeutic strategies and the future directions in the areas of 3D-printed stents, over-the-scope clipping systems, tissue matrices and atrial septal closure devices."

Diagnosis of severe ECAC is based on the presence of &gt;90% expiratory airway collapse on dynamic computed tomography (CT) and/or bronchoscopy. We offer patients with severe ECAC a trial of airway stenting to determine whether splinting of the central airways leads to improvements in symptoms, quality of life, exercise capacity, or respiratory function. Patients who respond positively to airway stenting are considered for tracheobronchoplasty."

Physicians caring for symptomatic patients with expiratory central airway collapse must localize the flow-limiting airway segments amenable to bronchoscopic or surgical interventions. Functional bronchoscopy and dynamic radiologic studies are performed for the initial evaluation and to design follow-up strategies. Research is needed to determine noninvasive and reliable physiologic methods for localizing the flow-limiting segments that might guide patient selection for treatment and predict response to interventions."

Secondary effectiveness outcomes included: difference in FEV<sub>1</sub> responder rates, target lobe volume reduction, hyperinflation, health status, dyspnea, and exercise capacity. The primary safety outcome was the incidence of composite thoracic serious adverse events. All analyses were conducted by determining the 95% Bayesian credible intervals (BCIs) for the difference between treatment and control arms. Between October 2013 and May 2017, 172 participants (53.5% male; mean age, 67.4 yr) were randomized to treatment (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;113) or control (<i>n</i>&#x2009;=&#x2009;59). Mean FEV<sub>1</sub> showed statistically significant improvements between the treatment and control groups-between-group difference at 6 and 12 months, respectively, of 0.101 L (95% BCI, 0.060-0.141) and 0.099 L (95% BCI, 0.048-0.151). At 6 months, the treatment group had statistically significant improvements in all secondary endpoints except 6-minute-walk distance. Composite thoracic serious adverse event incidence through 6 months was greater in the treatment group (31.0% vs. 11.9%), primarily due to a 12.4% incidence of serious pneumothorax.<b>Conclusions:</b> In patients with severe heterogeneous emphysema, the SVS shows significant improvement in multiple efficacy outcomes, with an acceptable safety profile.Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01812447)."

It can arise from a number of conditions, including pneumothorax, necrotizing infection, trauma, malignancies, procedural interventions and complications after thoracic surgery. Numerous therapeutic options, including noninvasive and invasive techniques, are available to treat PALs. Recently, endobronchial one-way valves have been used to treat PAL. We conducted a systematic review based on studies retrieved from PubMed, EMbase and Cochrane library. We also did a hand-search in the bibliographies of relevant articles for additional studies. 34 case reports and 10 case series comprising 208 patients were included in our review. Only 4 patients were children, most of the patients were males. The most common underlying disease was COPD, emphysema and cancer. The most remarkable cause was pneumothorax. The upper lobes were the most frequent locations of air leaks. Complete resolution was gained within less than 24&#xa0;h in majority of patients. Complications were migration or expectoration of valves, moderate oxygen desaturation and infection of related lung. No death related to endobronchial one-way valves implantation has been found. The use of endobronchial one-way valve adds to the armamentarium for non-invasive treatments of challenging PAL, especially those with difficulties of anesthesia, poor condition and high morbidity. Nevertheless, prospective randomized control trials with large sample should be needed to further evaluate the effects and safety of endobronchial one-way valve implantation in the treatment of PAL."

A 2-mm maneuverable and locatable guided sheath is steered to the target lesion by deflecting the magnetic field and signaling the progress of the sheath along the designated pathway. NAVIGATE,the largest national multicenter trial evaluating EMN, reported results of 1,215 prospectively performed procedures from 29 centers across the United States. This study showed a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for malignancy of 69%, 100%, 100%, and 56%, respectively, with a subsequent decline in diagnostic yield to 73% at 1-year and 68% at 2-year follow-up (23, 28)."

Aboudara et al. retrospectively reviewed their initial experience comparing standard EMN with and without digital tomosynthesis (67 versus 101 nodules, respectively) and reported an increase in diagnostic yield with the use of digital tomosynthesis (79% versus 54%; p D 0.0019) (40).",
          "equired to distinguish the various ILDs, which differ in treatment approaches (46, 47). Conventional transbronchial lung biopsies can provide smaller samples that are often insufficient and marred by crush artifact. While surgical biopsies provide sufficient tissue, they carry higher risk, with 30-day mortality rates of 2%, or even higher when done in a nonelective fashion (48). T ransbronchial cryobiopsy has emerged as a middle-ground procedure that can provide larger tissue samples devoid of crush artifact using a safer endoscopic approach. Cryobiopsies are done with a probe that rapidly freezes to GLYPH<0> 89°C and adheres to the adjacent lung parenchyma. Though the diagnostic yield of cryobiopsy is higher than that of conventional transbronchial biopsies, especially for nonspecific interstitial pneumonia, rates of adverse events are also higher, including a 56% risk of moderate to severe bleeding and a pneumothorax rate of 8% (49). Given safety concerns, its use is frequently limited to high-volume centers with local expertise. Oberg et al. have recently described the use of cryobiopsy to increase the diagnostic yield of lung nodule biopsies when performed with robotic-assisted bronchoscopy, demonstrating additional potential utility for bronchoscopic cryobiopsy (50).For the diagnosis of ILDs,integrating genomic gene signatures has shown promise to improve the yield of conventional transbronchial biopsies (51).",

Additionally, the rigid bronchoscope serves as an endotracheal tube, allowing patient ventilation while minimizing soilage of lung from secretions or blood. The barrel of the rigid scope can also debulk endobronchial tumors using an 'apple coring' technique. Other mechanical debulking devices such as the microdebrider, a rigid catheter that suctions tumor through rotating teeth, can provide immediate relief from centrally located tumors.",
