    "abstract": "Developing a new IP program, although a challenging endeavor, can be accomplished by understanding and addressing many facets of the health care community. Practice needs and competition should be carefully assessed to determine the viability of the new program. Devising a prudent business plan will further help assess the feasibility and guide the initiation and integration of the new IP program. The specific practice equipment, technology, and team should be clearly identified. Last, monitoring clinical and administrative aspects of the service must be pursued to ensure delivery of highquality and safe care.",

Although IP practice is still relatively limited to the east coast and Midwest regions and major academic centers, further growth is expected with the development of multiple new programs across the United States. 1,2 This growth is in line with continued medical advances in diagnostic and therapeutic pulmonary procedures as well as changes in health care that tie reimbursement to high-quality, efficient, and costconscious care. In effort to aid the interventional pulmonologist in developing a new IP program, the following may serve as a guide to navigate the aspects of starting a new program."

Working within the group, the interventional pulmonologist would be able to streamline referrals to allow for an off-loading of procedures from the pulmonary group, allowing the general pulmonologists to focus and grow other interests. The interventional pulmonologist ought to be mindful of the desire of many general pulmonologists to perform advanced diagnostic procedures, such as Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) and navigation bronchoscopy. This should not be fraught with resistance but rather acceptance and encouragement; there is room for both specialists to perform these procedures and facilitate coverage of patients. IP will likely end up performing more difficult procedures, such as sampling of smaller lymph nodes or full mediastinal staging, whereas the general pulmonologist can perform diagnostic Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) procedures for targets that are larger or located in favorable locations."

It is also important to decide what services may be offered in available clinical formats, such as inpatient and outpatient as well as locations such as a procedure suite or operating theater. Accessibility of anesthesia may also play a key role in deciding what locations may offer specific procedures. Determining timing, dates, and schedules of the use of the procedural areas should also be established. Further consideration may also be required to evaluate the preprocedural, recovery, cleaning, and storage areas as these issues play a role in the efficiency of the service. In addition, the necessary equipment would need to be defined and obtainable. For example, obtaining and maintaining an Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) tower, bronchoscopes, and disposables (ie, single-use Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) needles) would need to be factored into the analysis. Another factor to consider is the clinical involvement with the patients and associated primary services. For example, after receiving an outpatient referral for asthma and bronchial thermoplasty is performed, would this patient return to the primary physician or continue to follow with the IP service? Similarly, what clinical service will follow and manage the inpatient procedures? Will the IP service act simply as a procedural service or provide a more comprehensive consultation service and longitudinal care? An active inpatient and outpatient clinical presence may establish clinical rapport and increase referrals. This analysis also involves determining the members of IP team: nurses, respiratory therapists, and potential need of a service extender, such as an advanced practice nurse or physician's assistant. Specially trained staff members, such as a registered nurse, respiratory therapist, or advanced practice provider (APP), would provide IP specific advanced knowledge, support, and care providing direct and indirect benefits to the IP service.

Similarly, sharing nurses in preparation and recovery spaces and procedural support with other services is an economically sound model that avoids any disruption in coverage in case of illness or call-out by staff.

The interventional pulmonologist would also want to consider the current and competing groups in the community as the establishment of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) at one group may be hindered due to competition of an already established nearby practice. The presence of competing practices should not discourage the establishment of an IP practice; instead, it should ground the expectations of growth in reality and allow a reasonable period of time for ramp up.",

It is also important to decide what services may be offered in available clinical formats, such as inpatient and outpatient as well as locations such as a procedure suite or operating theater. Accessibility of anesthesia may also play a key role in deciding what locations may offer specific procedures. Determining timing, dates, and schedules of the use of the procedural areas should also be established. Further consideration may also be required to evaluate the preprocedural, recovery, cleaning, and storage areas as these issues play a role in the efficiency of the service. In addition, the necessary equipment would need to be defined and obtainable. For example, obtaining and maintaining an Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) tower, bronchoscopes, and disposables (ie, single-use Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) needles) would need to be factored into the analysis. Another factor to consider is the clinical involvement with the patients and associated primary services. For example, after receiving an outpatient referral for asthma and bronchial thermoplasty is performed, would this patient return to the primary physician or continue to follow with the IP service? Similarly, what clinical service will follow and manage the inpatient procedures? Will the IP service act simply as a procedural service or provide a more comprehensive consultation service and longitudinal care? An active inpatient and outpatient clinical presence may establish clinical rapport and increase referrals. This analysis also involves determining the members of IP team: nurses, respiratory therapists, and potential need of a service extender, such as an advanced practice nurse or physician's assistant. Specially trained staff members, such as a registered nurse, respiratory therapist, or advanced practice provider (APP), would provide IP specific advanced knowledge, support, and care providing direct and indirect benefits to the IP service. The composition and ideal number of the IP team depend on projected volume and scope of service.",
