    "abstract": "A tracheostomy is a surgically created airway that is kept open with a breathing tube, or tracheostomy tube. The tube is inserted directly into the trachea through an incision in the neck. A tracheostomy can be created with an open surgical or a percutaneous dilation technique 1 and can take place in the operating room or at the patient's bedside. The open technique involves dissection of the anterior pretracheal tissue and insertion of a tracheostomy tube under direct visualization. The percutaneous technique can be performed quickly and safely at the bedside with the use of a modified Seldinger technique and bronchoscopic guidance. 2 This approach is associated with fewer bleeding complications than open tracheostomy and similar long-term morbidity. 1 Tracheostomy should be considered in patients with acute respiratory failure who require prolonged mechanical ventilation - defined as ventilation for 7 days or more - and who are expected to have a meaningful recovery. 3 Tracheostomy decreases the need for sedation and facilitates weaning from a ventilator. 1,3 Additional indications include upper airway obstruction (including vocal cord paralysis), the need for airway protection in patients with conditions such as neurologic disease or traumatic brain injury, and the need for more effective pulmonary hygiene, including the use of recruitment maneuvers and methods for clearing the airways of secretions. Neither previous tracheostomy nor other types of neck surgery are contraindications. In fact, percutaneous tracheostomy may be preferred in patients whose surgical planes have been distorted. Absolute contraindications to percutaneous tracheostomy include cervical instability, uncontrolled coagulopathy, and infection at the planned insertion site. Relative contraindications include difficult anatomy (short neck, morbid obesity, minimal neck extension, or tracheal deviation) and severe respiratory disease resulting in the inability to withstand periods of apnea or in the loss of positive-pressure ventilation",

Bluntly dissect the pretracheal tissue with a dissecting tool until the trachea is palpable. In patients who require therapeutic anticoagulation or in whom there is any risk of bleeding, it may be advisable to place a purse-string suture around the tracheostomy incision. The purse-string suture is placed but not tied during this step. It will be tied to provide additional hemostatic control once the tracheostomy tube has been inserted. The suture is generally removed on the second postoperative day if there is no evidence of bleeding. The tracheostomy tube itself should not be sutured in place.

The needle should be inserted at the level of the second tracheal ring, perpendicular to the trachea, with the bevel facing down. Placement of the needle bevel in this downward position will help to direct the guidewire into the distal trachea. It is critical to avoid damaging the balloon on the oral endotracheal tube. In the event that the patient's condition becomes clinically unstable or there is difficulty performing the tracheostomy, as long as the balloon is intact, the oral endotracheal tube is simply advanced to its original location and normal ventilation is resumed. Additional supplies or personnel can be gathered. If the balloon is compromised, so too is the ability to provide positive pressure ventilation. A new airway must be expeditiously established by means of either a tracheostomy or oral endotracheal intubation with an intact tube."

Tracheal stenosis can occur anywhere along the trachea, from the tracheal stoma to the cuff of the tracheostomy tube. Stomal stenosis results from the trauma of tube insertion or excessive movement at the entry site. Cuff stenosis is related to mucosal ischemic injury from high cuff pressures. Tracheal dilation is palliative; definitive treatment requires resection and reconstruction. 6"

        "abstract": "Complications of tracheotomy are largely preventable. Although some authors cite these complications as indications for prolonged endotracheal intubation to avoid tracheotomy, others believe that the laryngotracheal complications of prolonged endotracheal intubation warrant early tracheotomy. Obviously, unnecessary tracheotomies should not be performed, and the controversy regarding the timing of conversion of endotracheal intubation to tracheotomy is handled in an earlier article in this issue. We feel, however, that a properly performed tracheotomy has a low incidence of complications that are more easily managed than are the complex laryngotracheal complications of prolonged endotracheal intubation. Significant post-tracheotomy tracheal stenosis occurs in 8% of patients and is secondary to an overly large tracheotomy stoma or damage at the tracheostomy tube cuff site. Stoma stenosis can be minimized by not making an overly large tracheal stoma and by prevention of undue leverage on the tracheostomy tube. Cuff stenosis can be minimized by the use of the high-volume low-pressure cuffs with careful prevention of overdistention of the cuff. Bronchoscopic dilatation, laser resection, and Silastic T-tube placement provide control of the airway until definitive surgical resection and reconstruction can be performed safely. Tracheoesophageal fistula is an uncommon but life-threatening complication that can be prevented by avoiding overdistention of the tracheostomy tube cuff and by avoiding the concomitant use of a stiff nasogastric tube. These patients are best managed conservatively until they are able to be weaned from a ventilator. A single-stage repair of both the esophagus and the trachea should then be done. Tracheoinnominate artery fistula can be avoided by correct placement of the tracheostomy stoma through the second and third tracheal rings rather than lower in the trachea and by avoidance of overinflation of tracheostomy tube cuffs."
