One critical shortcoming of diagnostic bronchoscopy is the relative lack of image-guidance: whereas interventional radiologists use high-fidelity intraprocedural imaging to guide their instruments and confirm technical success of their biopsy procedures, the majority of bronchoscopists continue to rely on historical scans, knowledge of airway anatomy, virtual roadmaps, and two-dimensional fluoroscopy that fails to render the majority of lung nodules. In an attempt to improve diagnostic outcomes, many bronchoscopists utilize radial endobronchial ultrasonography (rEBUS) - whether in conjunction with other navigational technologies or as a primary means of lesion-localization -in an attempt to visualize their target lesion prior to biopsy. Nonetheless, even a favorable ultrasound image does not necessarily mean that tissue-sampling will render a definitive diagnosis, as rEBUS alone does"

CTBD occurs due to changes in lung volumes, the development of dependent atelectasis, and even smalldegreesofdiaphragmaticexcursion.Thedegree of CTBD tends to be greatest for nodules near the diaphragm or in dependent portions of the lungs due to airway displacement and the development of atelectasis, with one study demonstrating average degrees of divergence of over 1cm for upper lobe lesions and over 2 cm for lower lobe lesions [5,8].",

When performing percutaneous lung nodule biopsies, interventional radiologists use frequent re-imaging and intermittent breath-holds to detect and minimize lung nodule excursion [911]. Many bronchoscopists have begun to adopt specialized anesthetic and ventilatory strategies to control for CTBD: these include rapid intubation with an endotracheal tube, using muscle relaxation, utilization of higher tidal volumes and higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to prevent derecruitment, and application the lowest tolerable fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) to help prevent resorption atelectasis [12,13 && ]. Yet, even with implementation of these techniques, some amount of CTBD is almost inevitable, and navigational platforms that utilize historic CT images for planning purposes may provide the proceduralist with a false sense of accomplishment: one might conduct a seemingly successful navigation under virtual guidance, but may in reality be at an unsuitable distance or orientation relative to the target's in vivo location owing to CTBD, and yet it may be difficult or impossible to detect and compensate for such navigational errors without advanced intraprocedural imaging."

Numerous studies have demonstrated how the absence of a bronchus sign is associated with inferior diagnostic yield, with one recent meta-analysis comprising over 2000 PPLs showing a difference in diagnostic yield of > 20% between lesions with or without a bronchus sign [14]. Even in the case of PPLs with a clear bronchus sign and successful localization via rEBUS, a conclusive diagnostic result is not always obtained: even if the navigational tools and biopsy instruments may be successfully directed down the airway to the target PPL, they may not be able to achieve the correct orientation relative to their target so as to penetrate the lesion and obtain a diagnostic specimen. In bronchus sign-negative lesions, plotting a transparenchymal course that defies the airways without intraprocedural imaging to confirm the spatial relationship between the bronchoscope and the target PPL may not be possible [4]. Although there are specialized tools and navigational platforms designed to overcome airway limitations by facilitating transparenchymal access to PPLs, efficacy and safety data remain limited, and confirmation of successful tunneling through tissue to the target lesion is not feasible without the use of adjunctive imaging [15-17]."

Yet, fewer lesions are successfully visualized using rEBUS, and far fewer still are successfully diagnosed on biopsy. In the prospective multicenter NAVIGATE study of over 1000 EMN-guided peripheral bronchoscopies, successful navigation and tissue-sampling was achieved in 94.4% of cases; however, the overall diagnostic yield was 67.8% at 24 months' follow-up (and perhaps even lower with the application of more conservative diagnostic criteria) [18,19 && ]. The stepwise decline from successful navigation and tissue acquisition to successful rEBUSvisualization and successful diagnosis occurs -at least in part - because there is no way to confirm that the biopsy tool actually penetrated its target without confirmatory imaging. Without the ability to obtain tool-in-lesion confirmation (TIL), one cannot be certain that the biopsy instrument was placed within their target (until a tissue diagnosis is made), and one is therefore significantly limited in their ability to make rational adjustments to achieve TIL. It is worth mentioning that while advanced imaging technologies may enable the proceduralist to confirm the relationship between the biopsy instrument and target lesion, achieving TIL is perhaps more closely tied to the bronchoscopic modality itself; whether using a catheter-based technique, a robotic-assisted platform, an ultrathin bronchoscope, or any other tool or platform, TIL is not always achievable."

Although the quality of CBCT images is inferior to that of fan beam CT, a significant portion of the patient's thorax may be rendered in a single spin, which generally takes between 6 and 10s to complete [20].

Other barriers to using CBCT include cost and access: CBCT fixed systems are expensive and require a dedicated room, and although many hospitals may already have CBCT procedural suites, bronchoscopists may have to compete with other interventional services for time. Although one study conducted in the Netherlands suggested that CBCT-guided bronchoscopy may be cost-effective relative to TTNA, no comparable studies have been carried out elsewhere [35 & ]. Lastly, as with all peripheral bronchoscopy methods, the use of a suitable anesthetic and ventilatory protocol is essential to maximizing procedural success: in one study of CBCT-guided bronchoscopy performed under conventional versus specialized ventilatory settings (including recruitment breaths, higher PEEP, lower FIO2, and higher tidal volumes), there was more atelectasis, more obscurement of the target lesion, and a lower diagnostic yield (although not reaching statistical significance) in the conventional ventilation group [13 && ]."

            "text": "Similar to how a CT scanner uses a computer algorithm to create tomographic images from a series of X-ray images, digital tomosynthesis (DT) and C-arm based computational tomography (CABT) utilizes computer-based reconstruction algorithms to create images with depth of field from multiple singleplane X-ray images (Fig. 3). Images are obtained over a limited range of angles with an X-ray tube and detector circling around an object, after which computer processing algorithms reduce the blur effects of synthesized images, resulting in 3D tomographic imaging along three planes that is functionally similar to that of CBCT [36]. DT enables realtime intraoperative imaging of both small lesions and biopsy tools [37]. Unlike conventional CT, where images are obtained over 180-360 8 , digital tomosynthesis utilizes X-ray images obtained over limited angles of rotation as small as 50 8 [38]. Since image acquisition occurs over smaller angle sweeps, the cumulative radiation dose of DT and CABT is a fraction of the radiation dose used in CT imaging. These smaller angles also allow for imaging to be done in smaller procedural suites utilizing mobile CBCT or conventional C-arm fluoroscopes. The quality of image reconstructions can vary, and depends on several factors: these include the ability to accurately isocenter the nodule within the image sweep, the speed of the image sweep itself, the quality of the fluoroscope detector, and the reconstruction algorithm (although machine learning has been used to improve upon these algorithms and provide better quality imaging). Even though images may not be of similar quality to CT or CBCT, if done properly they may still relay sufficient information to correlate the position of biopsy tools and provide TIL confirmation [39 && ].",

One such example of this is augmented fluoroscopy (AF), where real-time fluoroscopic images are augmented with information from historic CT images. In AF used during bronchoscopy, a digital representation of a target lesion - as visualized either on historic CT images or on intraprocedural CBCT images - is overlaid onto real-time 2D fluoroscopic imaging (Fig. 4).

The integration of advanced imaging into bronchoscopy is associated with better procedural outcomes, including superior diagnostic yield in many studies. Barriers to more widespread adoption of advanced imaging modalities include cost and access to new technologies, as well as comfort and familiarity with competing techniques. Fortunately, most advanced imaging platforms may be integrated into existing peripheral bronchoscopic routines, thus potentially easing the learning curve and lowering the bar for entry. Ultimately, it is our opinion that incorporation of advanced imaging modalities into peripheral bronchoscopy is an essential step in overcoming the procedure's existing diagnostic limitations."

        "abstract": "Over the last decade, the increasing diffusion of innovative and more powerful imaging guided techniques has further broadened the bronchoscopist's horizons in the diagnostic work-up of peripheral pulmonary nodules/masses (PPN/M). However, in most of institutions worldwide, due to the lack of resources and specific skills, the routinely diagnostic approach to PPN/M is still represented by imaging-guided transbronchial needle aspirations (TBNA) and percutaneous needle aspirations (PCNA). So far, no randomized clinical trials directly comparing the accuracy of the two procedures are available, and a standardized strategy that defines the proper role of each technique has yet to be established. In fact, the choice between these procedures is mostly influenced by \"environmental\" factors, such as operator's experience and local resources, rather than by an established algorithm, based on selected clinical scenarios. Data from literature indirectly suggest a higher sensitivity of PCNA compared to transbronchial approach, especially when lesions are peripheral and less than 2 cm. On the other hand, the transbronchial approach has been shown to have a better safety profile. Moreover, it offers the advantages to provide, during a single examination, a pathological diagnosis of nodules, information on mediastinal staging and airways involvement, and to identify potential synchronous lesions. In this context, it would be reasonable to firstly perform flexible bronchoscopy with TBNA, and, in case of inconclusive results, PCNA. In conclusions, both the techniques have been shown to be useful in the diagnostic pre-operative work-up of PPN/M. In order to optimize the diagnostic yield and to minimize the risk of patients they should not to be considered as two alternative options, but, rather, as two complementary techniques integrated in a standardized algorithm."

        "abstract": "To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous lung biopsy for solitary pulmonary nodules. Three hundred and eleven patients (211 males and 100 females), with a mean age of 59.6 years (range, 19-87 years), who were diagnosed with solitary pulmonary nodules and underwent CT-guided percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy between January 2008 and January 2014 were reviewed. All patients were confirmed by surgery or the clinical course. The overall diagnostic accuracy and incidence of complications were calculated, and the factors influencing these were statistically evaluated and compared. Specimens were successfully obtained from all 311 patients. A total of 217 and 94 cases were found to be malignant and benign lesions, respectively, by biopsy. Two hundred and twenty-five (72.3%) carcinomas, 78 (25.1%) benign lesions, and 8 (2.6%) inconclusive lesions were confirmed by surgery and the clinical course. The diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of CT-guided percutaneous transthoracic needle biopsy were 92.9%, 95.3%, and 95.7%, respectively. The incidences of pneumothorax and self-limiting bleeding were 17.7% and 11.6%, respectively. Taking account of all evidence, CT-guided percutaneous lung biopsy for solitary pulmonary nodules is an efficient, and safe diagnostic method associated with few complications."

        "abstract": "More peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs) are detected by low-dose helical computed tomography (CT) either incidentally or via dedicated lung cancer screening programs. Thus, using methods for safe and accurate diagnosis of these lesions has become increasingly important. Transthoracic needle aspiration (TTNA) and transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) are routinely performed during the diagnostic workup for PPLs. However, TTNA often carries the risk of pneumothorax, uncontrollable airway hemorrhage, and does not allow mediastinal staging in one procedure. In contrast, traditional TBLB often has a poorer diagnostic yield despite fewer complications. With the ongoing development of technology applied to bronchoscopy, guided bronchoscopy has become widely used and the diagnostic yield of TBLB has improved. Additionally, guided bronchoscopy continues to demonstrate a better safety profile than TTNA. In recent years, robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (RAB) has been introduced and implemented in the diagnosis of PPLs. At present, RAB has two platforms that are commercially available: Monarch&#x2122; and Ion&#x2122;; several other platforms are under development. Both systems differ in characteristics, advantages, and limitations and offer features not seen in previous guided bronchoscopy. Several studies, including cadaveric model studies and clinical trials, have been conducted to examine the feasibility and performance of RAB using these two systems; large multicenter studies are underway. In this review, published experimental results, focusing on diagnostic yield and complications of RAB, are analyzed and the potential clinical application of RAB is discussed, which will enable the operators to have a clear overview of RAB."

For these procedures, a thin-slice chest CT scan is performed prior to bronchoscopy at full inspiration and is used to create virtual airway reconstructions that are used as a map during bronchoscopy. Movement of the lung occurs with respiratory variation during bronchoscopy, and the location of pulmonary nodules during procedures may differ significantly from their location on the initial planning full-inspiratory chest CT scan. This study was performed to quantify pulmonary nodule movement from full inspiration to end-exhalation during tidal volume breathing in patients undergoing electromagnetic navigation procedures."

The CT is traditionally done at a full inspiratory breath hold (INSP), but the procedure is performed while the patient tidal breaths, when lung&#xa0;volumes are closer to functional residual capacity. Movement of a PN from INSP to expiration (EXP) has been shown to average 17.6&#xa0;mm. Therefore, the hypothesis of this study is that preprocedural virtual maps built off a CT closer to physiological lung volumes during bronchoscopy may better represent the actual 3D location of a PN."

        "abstract": "Partnership between anesthesia providers and proceduralists is essential to ensure patient safety and optimize outcomes. A renewed importance of this axiom has emerged in advanced bronchoscopy and interventional pulmonology. While anesthesia-induced atelectasis is common, it is not typically clinically significant. Advanced guided bronchoscopic biopsy is an exception in which anesthesia protocols substantially impact outcomes. Procedure success depends on careful ventilation to avoid excessive motion, reduce distortion causing computed tomography (CT)-to-body-divergence, stabilize dependent areas, and optimize breath-hold maneuvers to prevent atelectasis. Herein are anesthesia recommendations during guided bronchoscopy. An FiO<sub>2</sub> of 0.6 to 0.8 is recommended for pre-oxygenation, maintained at the lowest tolerable level for the entire the procedure. Expeditious intubation (not rapid-sequence) with a larger endotracheal tube and non-depolarizing muscle relaxants are preferred. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of up to 10-12&#xa0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O and increased tidal volumes help to maintain optimal lung inflation, if tolerated by the patient as determined during recruitment. A breath-hold is required to reduce motion artifact during intraprocedural imaging (e.g., cone-beam CT, digital tomosynthesis), timed at the end of a normal tidal breath (peak inspiration) and held until pressures equilibrate and the imaging cycle is complete. Use of the adjustable pressure-limiting valve is critical to maintain the desired PEEP and reduce movement during breath-hold maneuvers. These measures will reduce atelectasis and CT-to-body divergence, minimize motion artifact, and provide clearer, more accurate images during guided bronchoscopy. Following these recommendations will facilitate a successful lung biopsy, potentially accelerating the time to treatment by avoiding additional biopsies. Application of these methods should be at the discretion of the anesthesiologist and the proceduralist; best medical judgement should be used in all cases to ensure the safety of the patient."

If nonsurgical biopsy techniques are considered, deciding between bronchoscopic transbronchial versus computed tomography-guided transthoracic biopsy can be difficult. The former has a low diagnostic yield with a low complication risk, whereas the latter has a better diagnostic yield but a higher complication rate. Investigators have looked at various lesion characteristics that can predict the diagnostic yield of guided bronchoscopic biopsies. Although consensus exists that larger size and proximity to the hilum increase the diagnostic yield, there is ongoing debate about the association between computed tomography bronchus sign (air-filled bronchus in close proximity of the lesion as seen on computed tomography imaging) and the diagnostic yield of guided bronchoscopic modalities."

        "abstract": "Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) is a well-established imaging modality with numerous proven applications across multiple clinical disciplines. More recently, CBCT has emerged as an important imaging tool for bronchoscopists, primarily used during transbronchial biopsy of peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLS). For this application CBCT has proved useful in navigating devices to a target lesion, in confirming device tool-in-lesion, as well as during tissue acquisition. In addition, CBCT is poised to play an important role in trials evaluating bronchoscopic ablation by helping to determine the location of the ablative probe relative to the target lesion. Before adopting this technology, it is key for bronchoscopists to learn some basic concepts that will allow them to have a safer and more successful experience with CBCT. Hence, in the current manuscript, we will focus on both technical and practical aspects of CBCT imaging, ranging from systems considerations, image quality, radiation dose and dose-reduction strategies, procedure room set-up, and best practices for CBCT image acquisition."

Mobile cone-beam CT (m-CBCT) could potentially improve the performance of these readily available technologies. We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients undergoing bronchoscopy for peripheral lung lesions with thin/ultrathin scope, RP-EBUS, and m-CBCT guidance. We studied the performance (diagnostic yield and sensitivity for malignancy) and safety (complications, radiation exposure) of this combined approach. A total of 51 patients were studied. The mean target size was 2.6 cm (SD, 1.3 cm) and the mean distance to the pleura was 1.5 cm (SD, 1.4 cm). The diagnostic yield was 78.4% (95 CI, 67.1-89.7%), and the sensitivity for malignancy was 77.4% (95 CI, 62.7-92.1%). The only complication was one pneumothorax. The median fluoroscopy time was 11.2 min (range, 2.9-42.1) and the median number of CT spins was 1 (range, 1-5). The mean Dose Area Product from the total exposure was 41.92 Gy&#xb7;cm<sup>2</sup> (SD, 11.35 Gy&#xb7;cm<sup>2</sup>). Mobile CBCT guidance may increase the performance of thin/ultrathin bronchoscopy for peripheral lung lesions in a safe manner. Further prospective studies are needed to corroborate these findings."

Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) coupled with cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) for confirmation has the potential to improve diagnostic yield. We present our experience using this multimodal approach to biopsy 17 indeterminate nodules in 14 consecutive patients from April to August 2021. Demographic information, nodule characteristics, and biopsy results were recorded. Procedures were performed in a hybrid operating room equipped with a Siemens Artis Q bi-plane CBCT (Siemens, Munich, Germany). After ENB using the superDimension version 7.1 (Medtronic, Plymouth, MN, USA) to target the lesion, radial endobronchial ultrasound was used as secondary confirmation. Next, transbronchial needle aspiration was performed prior to CBCT to evaluate placement of the biopsy tool in the lesion. The average nodule size was 21.7+/&#x2212;15 mm with 59% (10/17) &lt; 2 cm in all dimensions and 35% (6/17) showing a radiographic bronchus sign. The diagnostic yield of CBCT-guided ENB was 76% (13/17). No immediate periprocedural or postprocedural complications were identified. Our experience with CBCT-guided ENB further supports the comparable efficacy and safety of this procedure compared to other mature biopsy modalities. Studies designed to optimize the lung nodule biopsy process and to determine the contributions from different procedural aspects are warranted."

        "abstract": "With flat-panel detector mammography, radiography, and fluoroscopy systems, digital tomosynthesis (DT) has been recently introduced as an advanced clinical application that removes overlying structures, enhances local tissue separation, and provides depth information about structures of interest by providing high-quality tomographic images. DT images are generated from projection image data, typically using filtered back-projection or iterative reconstruction. These low-dose x-ray projection images are easily and swiftly acquired over a range of angles during a single linear or arc sweep of the x-ray tube assembly. DT is advantageous in a variety of clinical contexts, including breast, chest, head and neck, orthopedic, emergency, and abdominal imaging. Specifically, compared with conventional mammography, radiography, and fluoroscopy, as a result of reduced tissue overlap DT can improve detection of breast cancer, pulmonary nodules, sinonasal mucosal thickening, and bone fractures and delineation of complex anatomic structures such as the ostiomeatal unit, atlantoaxial joint, carpal and tarsal bones, and pancreatobiliary and gastrointestinal tracts. Compared with computed tomography, DT offers reduced radiation exposure, better in-plane resolution to improve assessment of fine bony changes, and less metallic artifact, improving postoperative evaluation of patients with metallic prostheses and osteosynthesis materials. With more flexible patient positioning, DT is also useful for functional, weight-bearing, and stress tests. To optimize patient management, a comprehensive understanding of the clinical applications and limitations of whole-body DT applications is important for improvement of diagnostic quality, workflow, and cost-effectiveness.

        "abstract": "Digital x-ray tomosynthesis is a technique for producing slice images using conventional x-ray systems. It is a refinement of conventional geometric tomography, which has been known since the 1930s. In conventional geometric tomography, the x-ray tube and image receptor move in synchrony on opposite sides of the patient to produce a plane of structures in sharp focus at the plane containing the fulcrum of the motion; all other structures above and below the fulcrum plane are blurred and thus less visible in the resulting image. Tomosynthesis improves upon conventional geometric tomography in that it allows an arbitrary number of in-focus planes to be generated retrospectively from a sequence of projection radiographs that are acquired during a single motion of the x-ray tube. By shifting and adding these projection radiographs, specific planes may be reconstructed. This topical review describes the various reconstruction algorithms used to produce tomosynthesis images, as well as approaches used to minimize the residual blur from out-of-plane structures. Historical background and mathematical details are given for the various approaches described. Approaches for optimizing the tomosynthesis image are given. Applications of tomosynthesis to various clinical tasks, including angiography, chest imaging, mammography, dental imaging and orthopaedic imaging, are also described."

A tissue diagnosis is often required to confirm malignity, with endobronchial biopsies being associated with a lower pneumothorax rate than percutaneous approaches. Endoscopic diagnosis of peripheral small size lung nodules is however often challenging using traditional bronchoscopy and endobronchial ultrasound alone. New virtual bronchoscopic navigation techniques such as electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy (ENB) have developed to improve peripheral navigation, with diagnostic yield however remaining in the 30-50% range for small lesions. Recent studies have shown the benefits of combining Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) with ENB to improve diagnostic yield to up to 83%. The use of ENB however remains limited by disposable cost, bronchus sign dependency and inaccuracies due to CT to body divergence."
