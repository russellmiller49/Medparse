    "abstract": "TBM refers to excessive expiratory collapse of the trachea and bronchi as a result of weakening of the airway walls and/or supporting cartilage. This disorder has recently been increasingly recognized as an important cause of chronic respiratory symptoms. MDCT technology allows for noninvasive imaging of TBM with similar accuracy to the historical reference standard of bronchoscopy. Paired end-inspiratory, dynamic expiratory MDCT is the examination of choice for assessing patients with suspected TBM. Radiologists should become familiar with imaging protocols and interpretation techniques to accurately diagnose this condition using MDCT. 1. Paston F, Bye M. Tracheomalacia.

Changes in size of malacic trachea and bronchi depend on the difference between the intraluminal pressure inside the airways and the pleural (intrathoracic) pressure outside. 4,10 Pleural pressure depends mostly on respiratory muscles, and is high during expiratory efforts.

Despite increasing recognition of these disease processes, there remains some uncertainty regarding their identification, causes, and treatment. This article is intended to be a comprehensive review of both the adult and pediatric forms of the diseases, and includes sections on the historical aspects of the disorders, and their classification, associated conditions, histopathology, and natural history. We also review the various modalities that are used for diagnosis as well as the state of the art of treatment, including airway stent placement and surgical intervention."

CONCLUSION. Multidetector CT with inspiratory-expiratory imaging is a promising method in the evaluation of patients with dynamic airway collapse. In our study, the degree of dynamic collapse correlated well with bronchoscopic results. Dynamic expiratory multidetector CT may offer a feasible alternative to bronchoscopy in patients with suspected tracheobronchomalacia."

Surgical correction of mediastinal aortic vascular anomalies alone might not adequately treat airway symptoms if extrinsic narrowing is accompanied by intrinsic tracheomalacia (TM), a condition that escapes detection on routine end-inspiratory imaging. Paired inspiratory-expiratory multidetector CT (MDCT) has the potential to facilitate early diagnosis and timely management of TM in symptomatic infants with mediastinal aortic vascular anomalies."

A report of tracheomalacia is also presented. Ten volunteers were studied in the supine position with dynamic computed tomography (CT), at a level at or between the brachiocephalic vein and the aortic arch, with 3-mm collimation and with image reconstruction by means of a high-spatial-frequency algorithm. Ten 100-msec dynamic scans were obtained at 500-msec intervals during a 6-second period as the patient performed forced inspiration and expiration vital capacity maneuvers. The mean cross-sectional area of the trachea decreased dynamically from 280 mm2 at end inspiration (standard deviation, 50.5; range, 221-388 mm2) to 178 mm2 at end expiration (standard deviation, 40.2; range, 115-236 mm2; P &lt; .001) (mean decrease, 35% between inspiration and expiration; standard deviation, 18%; range, 11%-61%). The percentage decrease in cross-sectional area of the trachea correlates well with the decrease in the anteroposterior and coronal diameters of the trachea from maximum inspiration to maximum expiration (r = .879 and .916 and P = .0018 and .0002, respectively)."

        "abstract": "In tracheo- and bronchomalacia, localisation and determination of collapse is necessary for planning of surgical procedure. We compared inspiratory and expiratory spiral CT, cine CT, bronchoscopy, exemplary cine MR, and evaluated the clinical relevance. Twenty-nine patients (2 follow-ups; mean age 61 years, age range 27-85 years) with suspected or verified tracheal stenosis or collapse (post-tracheotomy: n = 17; neoplasm: n = 5; other: n = 7) underwent paired breath-hold inspiratory and expiratory spiral CT. Forty-five additional cine CT were performed at 1-4 levels (mean 1.5) during continuous respiration (increment 100 ms) to clarify respiratory collapse. The tracheal cross-sectional diameters of both techniques were calculated. Comparison with bronchoscopy, follow-up, and influence upon therapy were evaluated retrospectively. Exemplary comparison with cine MR (8 frames/s) was done in 3 cases. In addition to bronchoscopy, further information concerning localisation, extent, collapse, stability of the tracheal wall, distal portions of the stenosis and extraluminal compressions were obtained. A significantly higher degree and more pathological collapses (&gt; 50%) were seen using cine CT (38%) compared with paired spiral CT (13%; degree: p &lt; 0.0001; number: p &lt; 0.001). The findings changed the further therapeutic procedure in 16 of 29 patients. Further stenoses were excluded and bronchoscopy was verified in another 13 of 29. Temporal resolution of cine CT and cine MR is sufficient; however, spatial resolution of cine MR is inferior. Paired inspiratory and expiratory spiral CT localises tracheal stenoses and demonstrates relevant extraluminal compression. Significantly improved evaluation of respiratory collapse and further information of localised tracheal instability is obtained by cine CT. Cine MR promises more functional information especially due to free choice of imaging plane."

MATERIALS AND METHODS; Hospital records were reviewed to identify 10 consecutive patients with bronchoscopically proved TBM and 10 control subjects without TBM who underwent paired volumetric inspiratory and dynamic expiratory examinations with multisection CT. A low-dose (40-80 mA) technique was used for dynamic expiratory CT in 14 (70%) of the 20 subjects, and a standard dose (240-280 mA) was used in the remaining six (30%). All images were reviewed in a randomized, blinded fashion by two observers, who measured the tracheal lumen to determine the presence of TBM by consensus. The degree of confidence in measuring the tracheal lumen was graded on a four-point scale from 0(no confidence) to 3 (highest level of confidence), also by consensus of the two observers. Statistical analysis for differences in confidence level was performed with the Mann-Whitney U test. The image noise level was assessed by measuring the standard deviation of the presternal soft tissue, and statistical analysis for differences in noise level was performed with the t test."

The three most commonly used techniques are shaded surface display, maximum intensity projection, and, more recently, 3D volume rendering. Implementation of 3D volume rendering involves volume data management, which relates to operations including acquisition, resampling, and editing of the data set; rendering parameters including window width and level, opacity, brightness, and percentage classification; and image display, which comprises techniques such as \"fly-through\" and \"fly-around,\" multiple-view display, obscured structure and shading depth cues, and kinetic and stereo depth cues. An understanding of both the theory and method of 3D volume rendering is essential for accurate evaluation of the resulting images. Three-dimensional volume rendering is useful in a wide variety of applications but is just now being incorporated into commercially available software packages for medical imaging. Although further research is needed to determine the efficacy of 3D volume rendering in clinical applications, with wider availability and improved cost-to-performance ratios in computing, 3D volume rendering is likely to enjoy widespread acceptance in the medical community."

Image processing involves operations such as reformatting of original CT images, volume-rendered displays, surface-rendered displays, and physiologic imaging analysis. The reformatting process does not alter the CT voxels in any way; instead it uses them in off-axis views and displays the images produced from the original reconstruction process in an orientation other than how they were originally generated. Sagittal, coronal, oblique, and curved reformatting are standard reformatting methods. Other reformatting techniques include maximum-intensity projection, minimum-intensity projection, and variable thickness viewing. Volume and surface rendering are two different methods for reformatting axial images into three-dimensional views. CT perfusion allows the measurement of physiologic parameters over time. Additional postprocessing efforts can potentially add value to the patients and their outcomes, as can be seen in the cases that illustrate this article."

These entities are increasingly recognized as asthma and COPD imitators. The understanding of these disease processes, however, has been compromised over the years because of uncertainties regarding their definitions, pathogenesis and aetiology. To date, there is no standardized classification, diagnosis or management algorithm. In this article we comprehensively review the aetiology, morphopathology, physiology, diagnosis and treatment of these entities."
