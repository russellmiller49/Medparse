In the inpatient hospital setting, it is also used for coding procedures on claims submitted by the facility. In contrast, procedures furnished by physicians in all settings  and  hospitals  in  outpatient  departments are recorded using Current Procedural Terminology codes. Thus, services provided at the same time to the same hospital inpatient would be coded by the physician using Current Procedural Terminology codes and by the hospital using ICD-9-CM codes."

Clinical documentation in a patient's record includes any and all documentation that relates to the care of the patient during the patient's stay or encounter at the hospital. Documentation is key to accurate clinical coding, validating length of stay, resource utilization, physician profiling, case management, severity of illness, risk of mortality, quality management, risk management, clinical outcomes, critical pathways, regulatory compliance, Joint Commission accreditation, managed care, and reimbursement. Good documentation minimizes coding errors, reduces claim denials, and optimizes reimbursement. Implementing quality improvement strategies that make documentation and coding an organizational priority can positively influence operations, services, and revenue. Other external and internal coding audits show that the cause of improper coding is due to lack of proper physician documentation to support reimbursement at the appropriate level.

Coding staff relies on medical record documentation by the physician or provider (ie, health-care practitioner legally accountable for establishing the patient's diagnosis) to assign ICD-9-CM codes for the principal diagnosis, secondary diagnoses, and procedures. Medicare severity diagnosis-related groups (MS-DRGs) were implemented in October 2007, which affected many hospitals by removing many of the common comorbidities/complications (CCs) that resulted in higher-weighted CMS DRGs, thus creating a need for more-specific documentation that reveals the severity of care. This change has been the most significant in hospital reimbursement since the implementation of DRGs in 1983. For example, congestive heart failure (CHF) was a CC in the old CMS DRG system, but to be considered a major complication/comorbidity (MCC) or CC with MS-DRGs, the precise type of heart failure must be described as acute, chronic, or acute on chronic and with reference to systolic, diastolic, or combined dysfunction. Each DRG is assigned a relative weight (RW) to represent the resource intensity for the typical inpatient case. On average, an RW of 1.0 results in a lump sum reimbursement of about $5,000, depending on the hospital. The case mix index is the weighted average of the RWs of the DRGs and represents the organization's caseload. The case mix index compares the overall complexity of the hospital's patient population to that of its peers. Cases that have a CC or an MCC are assigned to a higher-weighted DRG.  3"

In other words, an acute condition established after careful examination, laboratory results, and investigation should validate the necessity of admission as opposed to outpatient management. The circumstances of admission, the diagnostic approach, and the treatment rendered are used to determine the principal diagnosis. Additional diagnoses are defined by the Uniform Hospital Discharge Data Set as all conditions that coexist at the time of admission, that develop subsequently, or that affect the treatment received and the length of stay.

In this circumstance, coding professionals cannot code pleural effusion separately unless the documentation supports additional studies, such as decubitus radiographs, or treatment, such as thoracentesis. It is important to have physician documentation of the underlying cause of pleural effusion. Transudative pleural effusion is commonly found in CHF, cirrhosis, and nephrotic syndrome. The exudative form is most common in bacterial pleural effusions or malignant pleural effusions. 5"

It is important to document all chronic conditions  that  may  be  considered  comorbid  and  to remember to link orders to a diagnosis within the progress notes. Many physicians are eager to find ways to improve their quality ratings. Because quality data are based on hospital records and coded data collected by outside agencies, physicians have a more compelling  reason  to  document  with  the  highest degree of accuracy. Documentation improvement is not a new concept in health care but an evolving trend that is critical to both the fi  nancial integrity of a health-care institution and the quality of patient care. Through ongoing education, documentation effi  ciency, and more-effective communication, physicians can help their institutions to become leaders among their peers while improving their ratings. So, the next time you receive a query form or e-mail requesting clarifi  cation, just remember that you are helping  to  make  a  difference  through  improved patient care, justification of resources used in treatment, and improved quality outcomes in the quality of care provided. 6"
