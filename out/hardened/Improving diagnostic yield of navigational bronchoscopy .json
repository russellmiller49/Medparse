During this investigation, lung nodules were found in 39% of the participants of which 72% required further investigation with a high risk of malignancy found in those with a nodule diameter of more than 20 mm (8). This study has since resulted in a United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) grade B recommendation for the use of CT screening for patients found to be at high risk. This includes patients aged 55-75 who have a smoking history of at least 30 pack-years, including those who have quit within the past 15 years. Additionally, follow up recommendations by the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) suggest using the least invasive modality to obtain an adequate amount of tissue to perform molecular and PD-L1 testing in the evaluation of lung cancer (9,10). In this regard, there exists the opportunity to provide this information in one minimally invasive procedure, supporting the continued pursuit of developing technology to improve navigational bronchoscopy diagnostic yield."

These advancements in  navigational bronchoscopy have empowered chest physicians to be able to access the periphery of the lung with more confidence in an effort to better evaluate and diagnose PPLs in a safe manner with increasing accuracy.

The physician is then able to track the synchronized probe or sensor while navigating the bronchoscope through the airways. In addition to biopsy to obtain diagnostic material, the system can also be used to place fiducial markers for radiation treatment and dye marking for surgical localization. There are currently two commercially available systems that utilize this technology: superDimension (Medtronic, Plymouth, MN, USA) and the SPiNDrive System (Veran Medical Technologies Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA). The superDimension system uses an inspiratory CT chest scan for pre-procedural planning. After the planning phase, a probe that is linked to the CT image by way of an electromagnetic field  is  inserted  into  an  extended  working  channel (EWC) through a therapeutic bronchoscope ( Figure 1 ). The working channel is then able to be navigated to the PPL. The SPiNDrive system pre-procedural planning uses both an inspiratory and expiratory CT chest to account for nodule movement during the respiratory cycle. This system utilizes a sensor at the tip of the biopsy/tissue collection tool that is then tracked within the electromagnetic field during the procedure. This tool is navigated through the working channel of a bronchoscope to the peripheral target.",

It should be noted, however, that such technology is  not  a  replacement  for  experience  and  thoughtful review of imaging and airway anatomy. As bronchoscopy advancements continue, the hope remains that the diagnostic yield will continue to incrementally increase. This improved diagnostic value and assurance of accurate localization will be imperative in pursuing locally ablative and therapeutic techniques for future treatments of PPLs. Additionally, the impact of alternative testing alongside the advanced navigational techniques will continue to shape the way physicians approach patients with lung lesions in the future. Cost, lesion accessibility, and operator experience should be considered when selecting the method of lung biopsy. These concerns should be discussed during a multidisciplinary conference in order to identify the best approach to achieve the highest diagnostic yield, quality of pathological data, and malignancy staging (if applicable) utilizing the least invasive methods."

Additionally, when there is concern for malignancy, guidelines have recommended performing the least invasive evaluation. Conventional bronchoscopy diagnostic yields for PPLs have reportedly been quite low and prior electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) studies have reported variable yields. Navigation bronchoscopy in addition to endobronchial ultrasound allows a physician to evaluate peripheral lung lesions along with mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes for the diagnosis and staging of suspected malignancy in one procedure. More recent advances in navigational bronchoscopy including the use of augmented fluoroscopy (AF), cone beam CT, and robotic bronchoscopy have pushed the boundaries of capability in evaluating PPLs. These added bronchoscopic technologies have shown to improve diagnostic yield especially when modalities are used in combination. The ultimate goal of endoscopically localized ablative and therapeutic treatment for peripheral lung lesions will require a high level of physician confidence, accuracy, and precision. This article will review the innovative characteristics and data of some of the more recently available navigational bronchoscopy devices.",
