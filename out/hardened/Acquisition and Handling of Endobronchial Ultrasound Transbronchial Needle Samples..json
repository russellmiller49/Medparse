The American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) lung cancer guidelines report an overall median sensitivity of 89% and a negative predictive value of 91% using EBUSTBNA. 2 As a result, the subsequent recommendation suggests that Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA be used over surgical staging techniques as the initial step in mediastinal staging during lung cancer evaluation. As the use of Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA has become more widespread, numerous questions have begun to arise about specimen handling to help maximize patient bene /uniFB01 t and outcomes. Current guidelines describe when to use Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA 2 and how to use Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA 3 ; however, limited information exists on Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-TBNA specimen management after retrieval. 4"

Inherent to its standard needle design, it is a larger aspiration needle; however, it does not reliably deliver a ' core ' tissue sample akin to the common acquisition of tissue with a core biopsy needle designed for such purpose. Additionally, many oncology clinical trials have often required ' core ' biopsies for eligibility which may be a somewhat arbitrary inclusion/ exclusion criteria as smaller needles can give adequate (and even more cellular) samples. We would suggest that future clinical trials eliminate this terminology requiring ' core ' biopsies and rather base these criteria on the ability to obtain adequate tissue for appropriate (ie, molecular markers, etc.) testing."

To overcome these problems, we undertook the current study to evaluate the clinical utility of the newly developed ultrasound puncture bronchoscope to visualize and perform real-time TBNA of the mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes under direct endobronchial ultrasonography (EBUS) guidance."

        "abstract": "Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration has demonstrated its accuracy in the diagnostic workup of enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. In addition to conventional smears, the use of liquid-based cytology (LBC) and cell block preparations (CBP) has been introduced more recently. The aim of our study was to determine the performance of each of the different techniques, separately and combined, in terms of diagnostic yield and sensitivity. A total of 290 consecutive patients were included. The pathological examination was based on smear cytology, LBC, and CBP. Adequate sampling was defined by the presence of pathological material or lymphocytes. The global diagnostic yield was 82.7 % and the sensitivity was 89.1 %. The diagnostic yield was 72.8 % for smears, 78.8 % for LBC, and 69.9 % for CBP. The combination of smears with CBP significantly increased diagnostic yield (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01) and sensitivity (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.006), but not the combination of smears with LBC (yield: p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.07; sensitivity: p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.13). The combination of the three techniques further increased yield (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.007) and sensitivity (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.006), compared with smears alone. CBP were more sensitive than smears for both diagnoses of carcinoma (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.01) and granulomatous inflammation (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.048). Conversely, LBC was less sensitive than smears for granulomatous inflammation (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.004), but the difference was not significant for carcinoma (p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.42). CBP, as a complement to smears, increases diagnostic yield and sensitivity for both diagnoses of carcinoma and granulomatous inflammation. LBC, if used alone, increases the risk of a false-negative result."

        "abstract": "The presence of intrathoracic lymphadenopathy and mediastinal masses in the pediatric population often presents a diagnostic challenge. With limited minimally invasive methodologies to obtain a diagnosis, invasive sampling via mediastinoscopy or thoracotomy is often pursued. Endobronchial ultrasound transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is a minimally invasive, outpatient procedure that has demonstrated significant success in the adult population in the evaluation of such abnormalities. Within the pediatric literature there is limited data regarding the use of EBUS-TBNA. We report the first multicenter review of a pediatric population undergoing EBUS-TBNA procedures identifying the feasibility, safety, utility, and outcomes of this procedure."

        "abstract": "<i>Background and Objective:</i> Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) is a minimally invasive endobronchial technique, which uses ultrasound along with a bronchoscope to visualize the airway wall and structures that are adjacent to it. Indications for endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) are samplings of mediastinal, hilar lymph nodes, and tumors adjacent to airway walls. EBUS-TBNA has been used in our clinic since 2009. The aim of the study is to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy of cytological and histological specimens, and the safety of EBUS-TBNA in an unselected patient population that has been referred to our hospital. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> We have retrospectively analyzed the medical documentation of 215 patients who had EBUS-TBNA performed in our clinic from April 2009 to February 2014. <i>Results:</i> There were 215 patients who underwent EBUS-TBNA. A total of 296 lymph nodes were sampled. EBUS-TBNA was diagnostic in 176 (81.9%) cases of cytological, 147 (68.4%) cases of histological, and 191 (88.9%) cases of the combined evaluation. In the lung cancer patients, EBUS-TBNA cytology had a sensitivity of 72.9% and histology of 72.9%, and in the sarcoidosis group, it had a cytology of 55.8% and histology of 64.5%. As all positive cytology and histology specimens were assumed to be true positive, specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) were 100%. The sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy was significantly higher when cytology and histology specimens were combined, compared with cytology or histology results evaluated separately (<i>p</i> &lt; 0.05) (for lung cancer 84.1% and for sarcoidosis 78.8%). The sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy of EBUS-TBNA procedures increased significantly over time, with increased experience. There were no complications with EBUS-TBNA in our clinical practice. <i>Conclusions:</i> EBUS-TBNA had a high diagnostic yield and was safe in the diagnosis of lung cancer and sarcoidosis. It was most informative when cytology and histology were combined. The informative value of EBUS-TBNA histology increased with our experience."

        "abstract": "Background Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is a diagnostic procedure that allows clinicians to stage lung cancer by sampling lymph nodes in the mediastinum. EBUS-TBNA is recommended as a first step prior to mediastinoscopy for lung cancer mediastinal staging. This procedure has greatly aided pulmonologists in diagnosing mediastinal pathologies with substantial progress. In this study, our aim is to analyze how cell blocks affect the diagnostic yield of mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy using an EBUS cytology needle. Methods This retrospective study was conducted at King Abdulaziz University Hospital between May 2021 and September 2021. Patients with mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy in the absence of known or suspected primary lung cancer were included. The EBUS procedure was performed using a flexible bronchoscope equipped with a working channel suitable for transbronchial needle aspiration&#xa0;under direct ultrasound guidance. Data were recorded using Microsoft Excel and analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) v. 26.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Diagnostic accuracy measures were determined, and a p-value of 0.05 was established as the final threshold for statistical significance. Results The total number of patients in our study was 151. The sensitivity for cytology specimens, histology specimens, and a combined evaluation for the full group of patients was 77.14%, 83.33%, and 87.5%, respectively, with a negative predictive value of 27.22%, 25%, and 21.42%. The diagnostic accuracy for cytology specimens, histology specimens, and a combined evaluation was 71.42%, 76.19%, and 80%, respectively. Conclusion Our study found that the combined examination of specimens for both cytology and histology in the diagnosis of lung cancer, sarcoidosis, and tuberculosis resulted in a higher diagnostic yield compared to cytological assessment alone using EBUS-TBNA."

In the ROSE group, the percentages of the suspicious specimens on cytology and non-diagnostic specimens on pathology were both significantly lower than that in the non-ROSE group (8.7% vs. 14.6%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.038; and 0.9% vs. 4.4%, p&#x2009;=&#x2009;0.018, respectively), and 13 out of 22 suspicious lesions on ROSE were confirmed with definite diagnoses on TBNA pathology.

These results suggest that ROSE during EBUS-TBNA allows for a low rate of suspicious results and therefore improves the diagnostic yield stratified by pathology when sampling hilar or mediastinal lymphadenopathy in patients with lung cancer."

We have previously reported superior characterisation with 21G biopsies over 22G biopsies for benign and malignant mediastinal nodes. A new 19G needle now exists but there are limited studies. We hypothesised 19G biopsies would improve both benign and malignant characterisation due to larger samples. We retrospectively analysed sequential patients referred for EBUS-TBNA with unexplained mediastinal adenopathy performed with 19G, 21G and 22G needles respectively (100 patients each). Contingency table analysis was performed. &#xa0;There were no complications. Sensitivity for malignancy was highest in the 19G group (95.7% versus 94.7% and 87.5%, respectively). The 19G group had higher mean lymph node size (19.4mm versus 18.6mm and 13.5mm, respectively), the highest proportion of lymphoma (9% versus 5% and 0%, respectively), the lowest proportion of NSCLC-NOS (2% versus 12% and 5%, respectively), the highest proportion of subcharacterised benign disease (89.6% versus 69.8% and 37.9%, respectively). This large single centre retrospective UK study suggests the 19G needle appears safe with the suggestion of better sensitivity for malignancy subcharacterisation of benign disease but this requires further study in adequately powered comparative controlled studies with univariate and multivariate analysis."

However, it remains unclear what quantity of specimens is needed to provide suitable mutational genotyping for adenocarcinoma.

This study compared the performance of a novel 19-G needle with a 21- or 22-G needle. Patients and Methods Eleven patients at Okayama Medical Center were enrolled retrospectively between April and December 2017. Enlarged lymph nodes and a pulmonary nodule were sampled with both 19-G and 21- or 22-G needles in nine patients. Two patients underwent biopsies for suspected lymphoma with only the 19-G needle. We examined their medical records on the diagnosis, size of the lymph nodes and pulmonary nodule, and complications. Results The median longest diameter of the 13 lymph nodes (8 #7, 4 #4R, and 1 #11) and 1 pulmonary nodule (right segment 6) in the 11 patients was 31.6 mm (range, 10.4-45.0 mm). Definitive diagnoses were made using the 19-G needle in nine patients. EBUS-TBNA with a 19-G needle resulted in successful diagnoses of one case of retinal hemangioblastoma, one case of tuberculous lymphadenitis, and one case of lung adenocarcinoma, as well as the evaluation of the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression following initial negative findings after a 21- or 22-G biopsy. A small pulmonary nodule (lung squamous cell carcinoma) with negative findings after a 19-G biopsy was diagnosed with a 22-G biopsy. Two suspected lymphoma patients were diagnosed with a 19-G needle: one had lymphoma and the other sarcoidosis. Three patients were diagnosed with sarcoidosis using both the 19-G and 21- or 22-G needles. Conclusion EBUS-TBNA with a 19-G needle was useful for diagnosing retinal hemangioblastoma and tuberculous lymphadenitis as well as for PD-L1 testing after 21- and 22-G biopsies were unsuccessful."

        "abstract": "The advent of targeted therapy in lung cancer has heralded a paradigm shift in the practice of cytopathology with the need for accurately subtyping lung carcinoma, as well as providing adequate material for molecular studies, to help guide clinical and therapeutic decisions. The variety and versatility of cytologic-specimen preparations offer significant advantages to molecular testing; however, they frequently remain underused. Therefore, evaluating the utility and adequacy of cytologic specimens is critical, not only from a lung cancer diagnosis standpoint but also for the myriad ancillary studies that are necessary to provide appropriate clinical management. A large fraction of lung cancers are diagnosed by aspiration or exfoliative cytology specimens, and thus, optimizing strategies to triage and best use the tissue for diagnosis and biomarker studies forms a critical component of lung cancer management. This review focuses on the opportunities and challenges of using cytologic specimens for molecular diagnosis of lung cancer and the role of cytopathology in the molecular era."

Immunohistochemisty is readily available in pathology laboratories, is relatively easy to perform and assess, can provide clinically meaningful results very quickly, and is relatively inexpensive. Pulmonary predictive biomarkers provide results essential for timely and accurate therapeutic decision making; for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, predictive immunohistochemistry includes ALK and programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) (ROS1, EGFR in Europe) testing. Handling along proper methodologic lines is needed to ensure patients receive the most accurate and representative test outcomes."

The regular updates of guideline recommendations reflect the growing number of biomarkers that must be assessed, and as such signal the shift from single-gene assays to more comprehensive genomic profiling using next-generation sequencing modalities. Cytology and small biopsy specimens have proven to be more than adequate substrates for these types of ancillary molecular testing; however, other alternative testing substrates are beginning to emerge. These include so-called liquid biopsies as well the supernatant fluid from cytology specimens, both of which have demonstrated promise for use in the clinical realm. This review will briefly cover the current state of non-small cell lung cancer biomarker testing in the United States, with a focus on these novel nonconventional substrates that are increasingly being incorporated into testing paradigms."
