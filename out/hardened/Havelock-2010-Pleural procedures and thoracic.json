Doctors in most specialities will be exposed to patients requiring pleural drainage and need to be aware of safe techniques. There have been many reports of the dangers of large-bore chest drains and it had been anticipated that, with the previous guidelines, better training and the advent of small-bore Seldinger technique chest drains, there would have been an improvement. Unfortunately the descriptions of serious complications continue, and in 2008 the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) issued a report making recommendations for safer practice. 1 These updated guidelines take into consideration the recommendations from this report and describe the technique of pleural aspiration and Seldinger chest drain insertion and ultrasound guidance. Much of this guideline consists of descriptions of how to do these procedures but, where possible, advice is given when evidence is available."

Ultrasound guidance is strongly recommended when attempting to aspirate any pleural effusion. It is even more important when aspirating small or loculated pleural effusions where there is a near or completely radio-opaque hemithorax, particularly in the absence of mediastinum shift away from the side of the lesion or when a clinically-guided attempt has been unsuccessful. However, the use of image guidance does not replace the need for clinical judgement, especially when siting the needle within the intercostal space.

Additionally, the soft tissue is often compressible and so a standard needle may be adequate to reach the pleura even if the depth is > 4.5 cm on CT imaging. Two studies have measured chest wall thickness on CT scans and found that a standard 40 mm long needle may not be adequate to reach the pleural space in the second intercostal space in some patients.

There was no increased bleeding in patients with mild to moderate coagulopathy (defined as PT or PTT up to twice the midpoint normal range or pit count of 50 to 99 x 10(3) per microL [50-99 x 10(9)/L]). However, patients with markedly elevated serum creatinine levels (6.0 to 14.0 mg/dL [530-1240 mumol/L]) had a significantly greater average hemoglobin loss (-0.82 +/- 1.3 g/dL [-8 +/- 13 g/L], n = 11) than patients with normal serum creatinine levels (-0.12 +/- 0.88 g/dL [-1 +/- 9 g/L], n = 450) (p = 0.011). Overall, the frequency of bleeding complications requiring red cell transfusions was very low: 0.2 percent of events. The most common diagnosis for patients who had paracentesis was alcoholic liver disease (72%); for those having thoracentesis, it was infection (37%). It can be concluded that, for these patients, prophylactic plasma or platelet transfusions are not necessary. Patients with markedly elevated serum creatinine deserve close postprocedure observation."

        "abstract": "In order to determine the spectrum and frequency of complications associated with thoracocentesis, we decided to audit prospectively all thoracocentesis performed in the medical service at our institution. Over a ten-month interval, 125 procedures were performed. We identified 114 (91 percent) prospectively, 11 retrospectively by a computer-assisted review of discharge summaries. Forty-six percent of the procedures were complicated by at least one adverse occurrence. Complications considered major occurred in 14 percent, minor in 33 percent. The major complications included 14 pneumothoraces (three required tube thoracostomies and one percutaneous aspiration), one splenic laceration, one sheared-off catheter, and one pneumohemothorax. The minor complications included pain in 28, persistent cough in 14, dry taps in 16, and subcutaneous fluid collections in four patients. We conclude that thoracocentesis can carry the risk of frequent morbidity even when a lecture and printed guidelines on performing thoracocentesis have been given and experienced individuals are in attendance during the performance of the procedure. Our study suggests a portion of this morbidity may be from poor technique, inability to adequately identify landmarks, and improper utilization of a needle-catheter apparatus. Suggestions for correction of these problems are made."

In addition, ultrasonography proved useful in suggesting or defining the cause for the initial unsuccessful attempt. Patients who have undergone an unsuccessful clinically guided thoracentesis and are referred for sonographic assistance represent a selected group who may have complicating factors not typically present during routine thoracentesis.

Fifty-two spontaneously breathing, cooperative patients with free-flowing effusions obliterating more than half of the hemidiaphragm on an upright, posteroanterior chest roentgenogram were randomized. When we analyzed those complications that were potentially life-threatening (eg, pneumothorax) and/or placed patients at increased risk for further morbidity (eg, pneumothorax, dry tap, inadequate tap), the sonography-guided method was associated with significantly fewer serious complications (0 of 19) than the needle-catheter (9 of 18) or needle-only methods (5 of 15). The sonography-guided method was associated with fewer pneumothoraces (0 of 19) than the needle-catheter (7 of 18) or needle-only methods (3 of 15). The difference between needle-catheter and needle-only methods was not significant. From our results, we conclude that the method by which thoracentesis was performed significantly influenced the spectrum and frequency of complications, and the sonography-guided method was the safest."

In a 30-month period, a computer search of hospital records identified 342 thoracenteses, of which 154 were done with conventional techniques by the clinical services, and 188 were done with sonographic guidance. Other factors surveyed included the patients' age, sex, underlying pulmonary disease, and overall clinical condition; the size of the effusion; the type of tap (diagnostic or therapeutic); the amount and type (exudate or transudate) of fluid acquired; and the size of the needles used. The technique used was the most significant single risk factor affecting the development of pneumothorax (18% for clinical vs 3% for sonography-guided thoracenteses). The incidence of pneumothorax decreased when a smaller amount of pleural fluid was aspirated (mean, 246 ml aspirated from patients who did not vs 472 ml from those who did develop pneumothorax) and when thin needles were used (4% pneumothorax with 20-gauge or smaller and 18% with larger than 20-gauge needles). The other factors surveyed did not influence the development of pneumothorax. Our results show that sonography-guided thoracentesis is complicated by pneumothorax significantly less often than is thoracentesis done with conventional techniques. Use of the smallest possible needle and aspiration of the smallest possible amount of fluid will also result in fewer cases of pneumothorax."

Studies to date supporting the technique have been anecdotal and nonrandomized. To determine if CU was beneficial when thoracentesis was performed by clinicians or house staff, we evaluated prospectively 205 patients presenting with pleural effusion at 2 community teaching hospitals. Decubitus roentgenograms were obtained on all patients, but CU with targeting by skin marker was performed on a randomized basis. Results were evaluated as to (1) whether the quantity of fluid obtained was sufficient for the intent of the procedure, (2) the number of needle insertions required to obtain the fluid, and (3) the incidence of complications such as pneumothorax. One hundred three effusions were evaluated by CU and 102 by roentgenography alone. The effusions in each group were stratified as small (obliteration of less than half of the hemidiaphragm on roentgenogram) or large. Small effusions were further stratified as free flowing or loculated (no layering of fluid on decubitus roentgenograms). By chi-square test, CU was significantly superior to decubitus roentgenograms alone for obtaining adequate fluid samples in small effusions (p less than 0.01). This was true regardless of whether the effusion was loculated (p less than 0.02) or free flowing (p less than 0.05). The technique had no such advantage in large effusions. We did not find that CU significantly reduced the need for multiple attempts nor incidence of complications in any group."

Hemithorax opacification provided an \"ultrasonic window\" for ultrasonic wave penetration to detect any underlying diseases. Fifty patients were included over a study period of 24 months. All had received both chest ultrasonography (US) and computed tomography (CT) examinations, and their underlying diseases had been confirmed by various methods. Comparisons between the findings of chest US and of CT were made in three compartments: pleura, parenchyma, and mediastinum. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of chest US was defined by using CT as the \"gold standard.\" The ability of US to detect underlying diseases was comparable to that of CT in pleural and parenchymal lesions. But US was inferior to CT for demonstration of mediastinal lesions. The diagnostic sensitivity of US was 95.1% in pleural lesions, 82.8% in parenchymal lesions, and only 30% in mediastinal lesions. US missed 14 lesions demonstrated by CT (seven mediastinal lesions, five parenchymal tumors, and two pleural nodules), but it showed six lesions that CT had failed to detect (four focal pleural thickening and two parenchymal tumors). US-related procedures were performed (thoracentesis in 33 patients, pleural biopsy in 10 patients, and US-guided aspiration/cutting biopsy in 11 patients) with a high diagnostic yield and no complications. The conclusion was that chest ultrasonography is useful, particularly as a first-step examination for patients with total or nearly total opacification of the hemithorax."

Subsequent analysis of 29 thoracic aortograms demonstrated a definite trend toward increasing tortuosity of intercostal arteries with advancing age. Consequently, the amount of space available for safe insertion of the thoracocentesis needle tends to decrease with advancing age. As a result, elderly patients are more prone to intercostal artery laceration during thoracocentesis, and careful attention must be paid to the proper technique for performing this examination in such patients."

Published recommendations suggest use of angiocatheters or needles in the 5-cm range for emergency treatment. Multidetector computed tomography scans from 100 virtual autopsy cases were used to determine chest wall thickness in deployed male military personnel. Measurement was made in the second right intercostal space at the midclavicular line. The mean horizontal thickness was 5.36 cm (SD = 1.19 cm) with angled (perpendicular) thickness slightly less with a mean of 4.86 cm (SD 1.10 cm). Thickness was generally greater than previously reported. An 8-cm angiocatheter would have reached the pleural space in 99% of subjects in this series. Recommended procedures for needle thoracentesis to relieve tension pneumothorax should be adapted to reflect use of an angiocatheter or needle of sufficient length."

Although RPE generally is believed to occur only when a chronically collapsed lung is rapidly reexpanded by evacuation of large amounts of air or fluid, in this review 15 of 47 cases of RPE available for assessment occurred when the pulmonary collapse was of short duration or when the lung was reexpanded without suction. The pathogenesis of RPE is unknown and is probably multifactorial. Implicated in the etiological process of RPE are chronicity of collapse, technique of reexpansion, increased pulmonary vascular permeability, airway obstruction, loss of surfactant, and pulmonary artery pressure changes. Since the outcome of RPE was fatal in 11 of 53 cases reviewed (20%), physicians treating lung collapse must be aware of the possible causes and endeavor to prevent the occurrence of this complication."

Reexpansion pulmonary edema after the insertion of a thoracic drainage for pneumothorax or pleural effusion is a rare complication with a high mortality rate up to 20%. It should be considered in case of hypoxemia following the insertion of a chest tube. The exact pathophysiology leading to this complication is not known. Risk factors for reexpansion pulmonary edema should be evaluated and considered prior to the insertion of chest tubes. Treatment is supportive."

A chest radiograph was performed routinely in all patients within 4 h of tube insertion. Lung expansion and the appearance of infiltrates within the lungs were investigated specifically. Re-expansion oedema was noted in three of 320 episodes (0.9%). Two of the three patients needed rapid and extensive clinical treatment."

The rate of REPE was higher in patients 20 to 39 years of age than in those over the age of 40, and the rate progressively increased in proportion to the extent of pneumothorax, as assessed by roentgenographic criteria. It is postulated that age-related changes in the lung may afford some degree of protection against developing REPE. It is also suggested that the treatment of pneumothorax with thoracentesis and/or suction drainage in young patients, or in the face of a large pneumothorax, requires careful consideration in view of a relatively high incidence of REPE in such individuals."

One hundred two patients were included and analyzed. Fifty patients were treated with the pigtail tube and 52 patients were treated with the traditional chest tube. The extubation time, mean hospital stay, evacuation rate, and total cost were similar without a significant statistical difference. Among the chest tube group, 15 underwent surgical intervention as a result of delayed resolution and hemopneumothorax; and among the pigtail group, 15 had other procedures for pneumothorax, including chest tube insertion and surgical intervention. This verifies our initial suspicion that the effectiveness of the pigtail drainage system is no less than that of the chest tube. Therefore, when considering ambulatory ability and good patient compliance, the pigtail tube drainage system can be considered as the treatment of choice for spontaneous pneumothorax."

The records have been reviewed in 44 consecutive patients in whom 53 small-bore catheters were placed for thoracic disease, including empyema, 20; effusion, 9; pneumothorax, 10; lung abscess, 4; and mediastinal cyst, 1. Insertion was performed under fluoroscopy in 88%, computed tomography in 6%, and ultrasonography in 6%. Catheters ranged in size from 6.5F to 12F, but catheter size did not seem to influence outcome (p = 0.6). There was complete resolution of the problem in 75% (33 of 44) of the patients, although 20% of them required more than one catheter. Treatment was successful in all cases of lung abscess. These patients had been previously treated with standard medical therapy for 12 to 53 days without significant improvement in their clinical condition. Patients with empyema composed the largest group treated. Eighty percent (16 of 20) of them had a loculated (LOC) process. The LOC group appeared to have a slightly better success rate than did the non-LOC group (75 versus 50%, p = 0.33). When the catheters failed to resolve the problem (empyema, 6; chylous effusion, 1; malignant effusion, 3; and spontaneous pneumothorax, 1, either operation (9.1%) or a standard thoracostomy tube (13.6%) was required. The complications rate was 20%, but most of these were minor problems including pneumothorax, 5; catheter occlusion 3; fractured catheter, 1; infection, 1; and significant subcutaneous emphysema, 1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

        "abstract": "Empyema and complicated pleural effusion represent common medical problems. Current treatment options are multiple. The purpose of this study was to access the outcome of image-guided, small-bore catheter drainage of empyema and effusion. We evaluated 93 small-bore catheters in 82 patients with pleural effusion (n = 30) or empyema (n = 52), over a 2-year period. Image guidance was with ultrasound (US; n = 56) and CT (n = 37). All patients were followed clinically, with catheter dwell times, catheter outcome, pleural fluid outcome, reinsertion rates, and need for urokinase or surgery recorded. Ninety-three small-bore chest drains (mean=10.2 Fr; range, 8.2-12.2 Fr) were inserted, with an average dwell time of 7.81 days for empyemas and 7.14 days for effusions (p &gt; 0.05). Elective removal rates (73% empyema vs 86% effusions) and dislodgement rates (12% empyema vs 13% effusions) were similar for both groups. Eight percent of catheters became blocked and 17% necessitated reinsertion in empyemas, with no catheters blocked or requiring reinsertion in effusions (p &lt; 0.05). Thirty-two patients (51%) required urokinase in the empyema group, versus 2 patients (6%) in the effusion group (p &lt; 0.05). All treatment failures, requiring surgery, occurred in the empyema group (19%; n = 12; p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, noninfected pleural collections are adequately treated with small-bore catheters, however, empyemas have a failure rate of 19%. The threshold for using urokinase and larger-bore catheters should be low in empyema."

Causes of catheter failure included kinking, malposition, inadvertent removal by patient, occlusion of the tube or valve by pleural fluid, and large air leak. No complication attributable to tube placement occurred. When the flutter valve was employed, the patient was able to ambulate allowing for potential outpatient therapy. The tube was found to be easy to use, safe, and efficacious in the treatment of pneumothoraces."

Three complications (1.8%) were related to problems of insertion, and four (2.4%) represented the problem of pneumothorax after chest tube removal. The remaining eight complications (4.9%) were associated with positive bacterial cultures, two (1.2%) of which represented clinical empyema. Both cases of empyema had either prolonged chest tube placement (23 and 15 days) or multiple chest tubes (two and three) on the same side. Percutaneous chest tube thoracostomy remains an important facet in the management of certain types of blunt thoracic trauma. Associated risks can best be minimized with adherence to a standardized technique and management protocol."

A retrospective case series of all patients at an urban, university-based level 1 trauma center hospital who received tube thoracostomy for any indication between 1/1/93 and 12/31/93 was conducted. Complications were defined as empyema, unresolved pneumothorax (persistent air leak or residual pneumothorax), persistent effusion, or incorrect placement. The data for age and duration of tube placement were weighted for analysis of variance (ANOVA). A total of 352 tube thoracostomies was placed in 239 patients. Twenty-three patients had three or more chest tubes placed, 65 had two placed, and the remaining 181 had a single tube. Ninety-nine tubes were placed in the ED, 87 in the OR, and 166 on IW. The mean age of patients in the ED was 37 years, and differed significantly (P &lt; .015) from those in the OR (48 years) and the IW (44 years). The duration of tube placement was similar for all groups (mean = 6.5 days). The overall complication rates related to tube insertion were: ED, 14.0%; OR, 9.2%; IW, 25.3%. Significance was achieved when comparing complication rates between the ED and IW, with less complications in the ED (P = .0436). When comparing complication rates between the ED and OR, there was no significant difference (P = .3643). A power calculation indicated too small of a sample size to truly determine an insignificant difference between complication rates between the ED and OR. Placement of emergent thoracostomy tubes in the ED does not result in an increased complication rate as compared to placement in the IW."

Forty-six subjects had sustained penetrating chest trauma. Either placebo (n = 60) or 1 gm/6 hours cefamandole (n = 60) was begun intravenously at the time of tube insertion and was continued intravenously or intramuscularly until the second day following tube removal. Cultures were taken of the pleural drainage, usually blood, at tube insertion, on tube removal, and on several occasions between those times. Antibiotic concentrations were determined biologically on the same specimens of pleural fluid as well as selectively on concomitant venous blood samples. Cultures were also obtained from all subsequent foci of infection, including the wound, any empyema, bronchial secretions, urine, or infected intravenous sites. Aerobic and anaerobic isolation and identification were carried out according to standard laboratory procedures with sensitivity testing (disc and tube dilution) only of the aerobes. Results demonstrated that infection of the lung and/or pleural space was eight times more common in the placebo groups (13.3%) than in the group receiving cefamandole (1.7%) (p less than 0.01). In addition, the single infection that developed despite use of the antibiotic was due to a susceptible organism. No major adverse drug reactions were noted."

Of these patients, 95 received a single dose of ampicillin before insertion of the chest tube, the remaining 93 patients received additional antibiotic prophylaxis for as long as the drain was in place. The incidence of intrathoracic sepsis (pneumonia or empyema) was 3.1% and 3.2%, respectively. It is concluded that single-dose prophylaxis in penetrating chest trauma is as effective as prolonged prophylaxis. The importance of chest physiotherapy immediately after the drain insertion and of early removal of the drain is stressed. The role of various possible risk factors in the development of sepsis is discussed."

A double-blind randomized clinical trial of patients requiring tube thoracostomy was performed at an urban Level 1 trauma center. All patients included in this series were patients with Injury Severity Scores of 9 or 10 (hemothorax/pneumothorax) who suffered isolated chest trauma secondary to blunt or penetrating trauma. Before chest tube placement, 139 patients (34 blunt trauma, 105 penetrating trauma) were blindly randomized to Group A (71 patients) for which they received 1 g cefazolin intravenously every 8 hours or Group B (68 patients) for which they received a placebo intravenously every 8 hours. Antibiotic or placebo was administered before chest tube insertion and continued until the time of chest tube removal. The majority of patients underwent chest tube placement in the emergency room with a small number of delayed pneumothoraces (4 patients) treated after admission. In the 71 patients receiving antibiotic, 7 complications (1 pleural effusion, 2 chest tube reinsertions, 4 additional chest tubes) occurred, none of which were infectious. In the 68 patients receiving placebo, 7 complications (2 empyemas, 2 pneumonias with effusions, 1 pleural effusion, 2 chest tube reinsertions) occurred, 4 of which were infectious and required antibiotic intervention (P = 0.05, Fisher's exact test). This study showed that patients receiving antibiotics have a significantly reduced incidence of infectious complications and suggests that patients who undergo tube thoracostomy for chest trauma would benefit from administration of prophylactic antibiotics."

No definitive conclusions have been reached regarding the efficacy of antibiotic use in this setting. The results of these clinical trials were pooled to generate an unbiased estimate of the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis for tube thoracostomy using the technique of meta-analysis. Meta-analysis is a statistical method for synthesizing results from separate but similar experiments, grouping them, and comparing each to the null hypothesis. Meta-analysis allows synthesis of all of the available data on antibiotic prophylaxis for tube thoracostomy to resolve the controversy surrounding this issue generated by different but similar clinical studies with conflicting results. Despite different conclusions of value when taken individually, the combined analysis does not support the null hypothesis (no effect of antibiotics). The statistical method is highly significant despite different mechanisms of injury, pathologic findings, and antibiotics employed."

A meta-analysis of six randomized studies previously reported was performed. The analysis was carried out using the Confidence Profile Method software FAST*PRO. The meta-analysis was structured using dichotomous outcomes of infectious chest processes (empyema, effusion, pneumonia, wound infection, tracheitis, etc.) versus no infectious chest process in patients with and without antibiotics. The effect measures calculated included actual difference in probabilities, relative risk, percent differences in probabilities, and odds ratio. The results of this meta-analysis suggest that antibiotics should be used in patients undergoing tube thoracostomy. Antibiotic selection should maximize therapy for Staph. aureus. The implementation of this practice guideline will require the co-operation of multiple specialty oriented physicians and surgeons."

After drainage pleurodesis was performed with tetracycline as sclerosing agent. Of 18 evaluable consecutive patients (mean age 67.8 years) nine were randomized for pleurodesis with the small and nine for the large catheter. In the former group, the majority (seven of nine) did not find insertion of the catheter more unpleasant than thoracentesis. In the latter group only a few (two of nine) found insertion comparable with thoracentesis (P &lt; 0.05). All patients found the presence of the large catheter very or somewhat unpleasant (two and seven patients), whereas this was only the case for a few (no and two patients) treated with the small catheter (P &lt; 0.05). In the former group three patients required new thoracentesis, whereas this was only the case for two patients in the latter group (P &gt; 0.05). No complications were seen. We conclude that pleurodesis in patients with recurrent malignant pleural effusion can be performed with a small percutaneous catheter (Cystofix) with an effect similar to that obtained with a large-bore chest tube and with less discomfort for the patient."

During the past 3-4 years, the authors used small catheters (7, 8.2, and 9.4 F) to decompress 30 pneumothoraxes (15 under tension) resulting from percutaneous lung biopsy. The catheters were inserted under computed tomographic or fluoroscopic guidance for the treatment of large (greater than 35%) or symptomatic pneumothoraxes. Twenty-eight of 30 patients were treated successfully with the small catheters alone; two patients underwent surgical placement of 32-F tubes (4 and 12 hours later) because of incomplete resolution of the pneumothoraxes. This series demonstrates that small-caliber catheters effectively decompress pneumothoraxes and that they can be inserted expeditiously by radiologists in the radiology department."

Both a large- and a small-bore intercostal tube drain system were in use during the two-year period reviewed. Similar pneumothorax profile and numbers treated with both drains were recorded, resulting in a similar drain time and numbers of successful and failed re-expansion of pneumothoraces. Successful pneumothorax resolution was the same for both drain types and the negligible tube drain complications observed with the small-bore drain reflected previously reported experiences. However the large-bore drain was associated with a high complication rate (32%) with more infectious complications (24%). The small-bore drain was prone to displacement (21%). There was generally no evidence of an increased failure and morbidity, reflecting poorer expertise, in the non-specialist trainees managing the pneumothoraces. A practical finding however was that in those large pneumothoraces where re-expansion failed, the tip of the drain had not been sited at the apex of the pleural cavity irrespective of the drain type inserted."

In 40 patients, image-guided catheter drainage was the primary treatment method; in three it was used after conventional, surgical chest tube placement failed. Drainage was performed with ultrasound guidance in 30 patients (69.8%), computed tomography in eight (18.6%), and fluoroscopy in five (11.6%). A combination of guidance modalities was used in six patients. Image-guided catheter drainage alone was successful in 31 of 43 patients (72.1%). In three patients (7%), empyemas were initially drained, but a thoracotomy was ultimately required because of a persistent pleural peel. In eight patients (18.6%), the procedure failed, predominantly due to tube clogging, persistent pneumothorax, or progressive development of a pleural peel. In one patient, drainage was successful but he died 10 days later of complications of renal failure. No major complications were encountered. Treatment of these patients requires a thorough understanding of the pathogenesis of pleural space infection, principles of empyema drainage, techniques of abscess drainage under image guidance, and the use of a pleural drainage system."

Fifteen patients (88.2%) were treated successfully, averting surgery or further drainage, and bacteremia in 1 patient was the only complication. Previously unrecognized communications with the bronchi, esophagus, and subphrenic space were demonstrated, and intracavitary tumor biopsy and instillation of a sclerosing agent were performed in several patients. Compared to the tubes used to drain abdominal abscesses, empyema catheters need less irrigation; dionosil is often the preferred contrast agent, the catheter can be withdrawn in one step, and a residual fibrotic or tumor cavity may persist after pus has been evacuated."

With aggressive use of this procedure in the emergency department, the incidence of technical complications was 1 percent. Our review suggests that complications can be further diminished by the routine use of large thoracostomy tubes that are placed well up on the chest after confirmation of an open pleural space, by avoiding the use of a trocar for tube placement, and by the use of a high volume, low pressure suction system. Empyema was the most common complication associated with tube thoracostomy after trauma. It occurred in 2.4 percent of the patients. Its exact causes is not known, and the role of prophylactic antibiotics needs to be established."

Additionally, a distinction could be made between nodular lesions (N = 19), sheet-like tumor masses (N = 10), and combined (N = 3) tumor spread. In all cases thoracentesis was performed. Cytology showed malignant cells in 28 patients. Pleural metastasis was histologically confirmed by ultrasound-guided fine needle biopsy in 2 cases.

Ultrasound has been proved to be valuable for the evaluation of a wide variety of chest diseases, particularly when the pleural cavity is involved. Chest ultrasound can supplement other imaging modalities of the chest and guides a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. Pleural effusion, pleural thickening, pleural tumors, tumor extension into the pleura and even the chest wall, pleuritis, and pneumothorax can be detected easily and accurately with chest ultrasound. Many ultrasound features and signs of these diseases have been well characterized and widely applied in clinical practice. Under real-time ultrasound guidance the success rates of invasive procedures on pleural diseases increase significantly whereas the risks are greatly reduced. The advantages of low-cost, bedside availability and no radiation exposure have made ultrasound an indispensable diagnostic tool in modern pulmonary medicine."

In all patients the clinical or radiographic appearances were atypical and they were referred for guided aspiration or drainage of suspected pleural fluid. Ultrasound guided aspiration was successful in 90 collections in 86 patients. It was unsuccessful in three \"collections\" subsequently shown or presumed to be of a solid nature. In nine of the proven fluid collections an earlier attempt at blind aspiration had been unsuccessful. 54 (60%) of the proven fluid collections had a characteristic sonographic appearance of pleural fluid as an anechoic space unrestricted within the pleura. Of the remaining 36 collections, 16 had diffuse internal echoes, 12 were confined to one area of the pleural space (primary loculation) and 13 had internal septa (secondary loculation). Dynamic signs were demonstrated in 75 (83%) of the collections as flapping movements of atelectatic lung (51), of internal septa (12), or of debris attached to the wall of the collection (25). Three (4%) of fluid collections had sonographic features indistinguishable from those of solid pleural lesions, indicating that in a small percentage of cases sonography will not reliably distinguish between solid and fluid in the pleural space."

Real-time, gray-scale, and color Doppler chest ultrasound examinations were carried out by different sonographers who had no clinical information concerning the patients. The sonographer evaluated the images for internal echogenicity of the effusion, pleural lesions that change shape with respiration, and movable septa and echo-densities in pleural space in conventional gray-scale as well as color signal in color Doppler ultrasound. Of the 35 patients with true effusion, 33 had positive color signal (sensitivity 94.3%, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 89 to 98.6%); in 16 patients without effusion, none had color signal (specificity 100%, 95% CI 83 to 100%). Although real-time, gray-scale ultrasound is also sensitive for detecting minimal effusion (sensitivity 100%, 95% CI 92 to 100%), it is less specific (specificity 68.7%, 95% CI 46 to 91.5%). Five of 16 examinations showing fluid-like lesions were found to be deceptive. With relatively high sensitivity and specificity, this method proved to be a useful diagnostic aid to real-time, gray-scale ultrasound for diagnosis of minimal or loculated effusion."

All patients with a clinical diagnosis of thoracic empyema underwent transthoracic ultrasonographic examination and thoracentesis at admission. According to the presence or absence of septa in sonographic images, the patients were classified into two groups: septated and nonseptated. Sonographic findings were analyzed with respect to duration of hospital stay, chest tube drainage, and treatment efficacy. A total of 163 consecutive patients were included in the study (83 patients with septated and 80 with nonseptated sonographic images). The mean duration of hospital stay (35.4 versus 27.0 days, P = 0.009) and chest tube drainage (13.1 versus 7.6 days, P &lt; 0.001) for the patients with septa were significantly longer than for those without septa. The patients with septa were more likely to undergo intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy (63.8% versus 38.8%, odds ratio 2.79, P = 0.001) and surgical intervention (24.3% versus 7.5%, odds ratio 3.92, P = 0.004). We concluded that sonographic septation is a useful sign to predict the need for subsequent intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy and surgical intervention in cases of acute thoracic empyema. Early fibrinolytic therapy or even surgical intervention may be indicated in patients with sonographic septations."

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of image-guided percutaneous catheter drainage (IGPCD) of thoracic empyemas, and to correlate the outcome of IGPCD with the pre-procedural sonographic appearance. One hundred three patients (74 males and 29 females) with thoracic empyema (age range 1 month to 70 years, median age 28 years) underwent IGPCD. In 63 (61.17%) patients, IGPCD was the primary treatment modality; in 40 (38.84%) patients it was used after unsuccessful intercostal chest tube drainage (ICTD). Ultrasound was the main modality used for guidance; CT guidance was used in only 7 patients (6.8%). Eight- to 12-F pigtail catheters or 10- to 14-F Malecot catheters were used. The outcome was correlated with the pre-procedural US appearance (anechoic, complex non-septated or complex septated) of the empyema. The IGPCD technique was successful in 80 of 102 patients. Based on the US appearance, IGPCD was successful in 12 of 13 (92.3%) patients with anechoic empyemas; 53 of 65 (81.54%) patients with complex non-septated empyemas, and in 15 of 24 (62.5%) patients with complex septated empyemas. A statistically significant difference (p &lt; 0.01) was seen in the outcome of IGPCD in the three categories. Twenty-two patients required further treatment: ICTD (n = 9; 2 of them later also underwent surgery); and surgery (n = 15). The duration of catheter drainage ranged from 2-60 days. No major complications were encountered. Percutaneous catheter drainage of thoracic empyemas with imaging guidance ensures accurate catheter placement with a high success and a low complication rate. Pre-procedural US can predict the likelihood of success of IGPCD."

The core procedure of ultrasound-guided thoracentesis has been expanded to allow catheter drainage of empyema, bronchopleural fistula, abscesses in the lung, mediastinum, pericardium, and infected tumors. Tailored use of guidance methods permits effective evacuation of most of these abscesses and noninfected collections. This paper details the authors' approach to each of these entities while highlighting the results and expected pitfalls of these techniques."

The observation of the hyperechogenic line of the pleuropulmonary surface (normal subjects) showed back-and-forth respiratory movements in every case which we call the \"gliding sign.\" Ultrasonographic signs were shown in all patients with HPN. Visualizing the gassy effusion above the pleural fluid, the disappearance of the \"gliding sign\" (n = 11) indicates PN. The image of the HPN allows in addition a \"curtain sign\" which depicts the movement of air/fluid level (n = 11), the pulmonary collapse being calculated across the liquid window whose echostructure is analyzed. A \"polymicrobullous\" image (n = 2) caused by air microbubbles within the fluid effusion, is reported. We conclude that echography appears to be a new approach to diagnosing HPN, which is particularly useful during or after ultrasonically guided procedures including pleural drainage, and should be recognized by sonographers."

Furthermore, it is increasingly used to guide interventional procedures of the chest and pleural space. The technique lends itself to bedside use in the intensive care unit, where suboptimal radiography may mask or mimic clinically significant abnormalities. The authors discuss the uses, techniques and applications of US of the chest. The sonographic appearances of pleural diseases (pleural effusion, pneumothorax, pleural mass, and mesothelioma), parenchymal diseases (pneumonia, neoplasms, heart failure, infarct, and rounded atelectasis), chest wall abnormalities (chest wall tumor and rib fracture), and diaphragmatic paralysis are discussed. The use of US in guiding biopsy, thoracocentesis, and other interventional procedures of the lung, pleural space, and mediastinum are also reviewed."

This study aimed at evaluating the accuracy of the diagnosis of PE on SCXR and was performed in two phases. At phase 1, a formula for the sonographic estimation of the volume of PE was established by correlating 24 measurements (in 7 patients in whom complete drainage was achieved) with the drained volumes. At phase two, 112 consecutive SCXRs were supplemented by sonography of the chest. The films were evaluated for the presence of PE and for the presence of different radiologic signs of PE. Sonography showed PE in 41 right and 30 left hemithoraces. The overall accuracy of the diagnosis of PE on SCXR was 82 %. Only one of the undiagnosed PEs had a volume of &gt; 300 ml. The most accurate signs were increased density of the hemithorax, blunted costophrenic angle, and loss of the hemidiaphragm silhouette."

        "abstract": "A prospective study of 129 consecutive thoracocentesis in 86 patients at a university medical center evaluated the clinical value, complications, and patient experience with thoracocentesis. Pleural fluid analysis in conjunction with the clinical presentation placed 78 pleural fluids into diagnostic categories: definitive 14 (18 percent), presumptive 44 (56 percent), and nondiagnostic 20 (26 percent). Fourteen of 78 (18 percent) of the nondiagnostic fluids were useful, while only six (8 percent) were not useful clinically; therefore, 92 percent of thoracocentesis provided clinically useful information. Using sequential data analysis, initial diagnostic categorizations of eight of 78 patients were upgraded from presumptive or nondiagnostic to definitive based on data available 24 hours following thoracocentesis. Thus, 70 patients were categorized based on the pleural fluid data obtained within the first 24 hours of thoracocentesis. Thirty-four objective complications occurred in 26 of 129 (20 percent) thoracocentesis. The most common complications were pneumothorax, 15 of 129 (12 percent), and cough, 12 of 129 (9 percent). Sixty-five subjective complications occurred in 56 of 123 (46 percent) thoracocentesis. Anxiety, 26 of 123 (21 percent), and site pain, 24 of 123 (20 percent), were the most common subjective complications noted. Thirty technical problems occurred in 129 (23 percent) thoracocentesis with blood contamination, 14 of 129 (11 percent), and dry tap, nine of 129 (7 percent), being the most common. We conclude that diagnostic thoracocentesis is a clinically valuable procedure if used in conjunction with the patient presentation with an understanding of its limitations for providing a specific etiologic diagnosis. When performed by physicians in training, the number of complications are substantial and the operator often underestimates the degree of patient discomfort. Awareness of the clinical value and complications of thoracocentesis should lead to improved use and safety of this procedure."
