In recent years, there has been a paradigm shift in the management of tracheal injury towards minimally invasive modalities, such as endobronchial stent placement. Although there are still some de /uniFB01 nitive indications for surgery, selected patients who meet traditional surgical criteria as well as those patients who were deemed to be poor surgical candidates can now be managed successfully using minimally invasive techniques.

Bronchoscopy remains the ' gold standard ' for the diagnosis of tracheal injury. Bronchoscopy not only helps in identifying the exact location and size of the injury but may also help in treatment of the injury. 39,40 In endotracheally intubated patients the ET cuff may cover the injured portion of the trachea and hinder assessment of the extent of tracheal injury. For this reason such patients usually receive diagnoses of tracheal injury only after extubation. In cases with a high suspicion of tracheal injury, the cuff may be de /uniFB02 ated during bronchoscopic evaluation and manipulated to visualize the tracheal injury and to assess its extent and severity. In the event of a complete laceration of the tracheal wall, it is important to assess for concomitant esophageal injury. This may require upper gastroenterologic endoscopy and/or CT chest imaging with oral contrast to identify esophageal leak and pneumomediastinum. 41 Acute mediastinitis can be diagnosed on chest CT imaging with signs such as increased attenuation of the mediastinal fat pad and mediastinal /uniFB02 uid collection. 42"

            "text": "Tracheobronchial injury may not be as rare as previously reported. It occurs infrequently but remains a high-impact event with signi /uniFB01 cant morbidity and mortality. Injuries that were historically treated by surgical repair can now be successfully treated via careful multidisciplinary patient selection for interventional pulmonology techniques at centers of excellence. This is a promising treatment strategy and should be considered prior to surgical treatment; especially in patients who do not meet absolute indications for surgery or who are high-risk surgical candidates."

        "abstract": "We aim to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the cases of postintubation tracheal rupture (PiTR) published in the literature, with the aim of determining the risk factors that contribute to tracheal rupture during endotracheal intubation. A further objective has been to determine the ideal treatment for this condition (surgical repair or conservative management). A MEDLINE review of cases of tracheal rupture after intubation published in the English language and a review of the references in the articles found. The articles included were those that reported at least the demographic data (age and sex), the treatment performed, and the outcome. Those papers that did not detail the above variables were excluded. The search found 50 studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria. These studies included 182 cases of postintubation tracheal rupture. The overall mortality was 22% (40 patients). A statistical analysis was performed determining the relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) and/or statistical significance. The analysis was performed on the overall group and after dividing into 2 subgroups: patients in whom the lesion was detected intraoperatively, and other patients. Patient age (p=0.015) and emergency intubation (RR=3.11; 95% CI, 1.81-5.33; p=0.001) were variables associated with an increased mortality. In those patients in whom the PiTR was detected outside the operating theatre (delayed diagnosis), emergency intubation (RR=3.05; 95% CI, 1.69-5.51; p&lt;0.0001), the absence of subcutaneous emphysema (RR=2.17; 95% CI, 1.25-4; p=0.001), and surgical treatment (RR=2.09; 95% CI, 1.08-4.07; p=0.02) were associated with an increased mortality. In addition, age (p=0.1) and male gender (RR=1.89; 95% CI, 0.98-3.63; p=0.13) showed a clear trend towards an increased mortality. PiTR is an uncommon condition but carries a high morbidity and mortality. Emergency intubation is the principal risk factor, increasing the risk of death threefold compared to elective intubation. Conservative treatment is associated with a better outcome. However, the group of patients who would benefit from surgical treatment has not been fully defined. Further studies are required to evaluate the best treatment options."

        "abstract": "During the past ten years, 20 patients with acute penetrating tracheal injury (15 cervical and 5 thoracic) have been treated at Grady Memorial Hospital. Ten of the 20 patients had other major associated injuries: 6 had esophageal wounds, 5 had arterial injuries, and 2 had additional wounds. In the first 5 patients treatment of the tracheal injuries consisted of tracheostomy alone. Later on, the tracheal wounds were managed according to type, site, size, and the type of other organ injury. Repair of the tracheal wound and tracheostomy were done in 3 patients, repair of the tracheal wound and temporary tracheal intubation in 4 patients, tracheocutaneous stoma in 1 patient, temporary tracheal intubation alone in 4 patients, and observation alone in 3 patients. Seventeen patients recovered from their injuries and 3 died from sepsis, respiratory insufficiency, or cerebrovascular accident. All 3 deceased patients had other major injuries. This experience suggests that the treatment of penetrating tracheal injury should depend upon the type, size, and site of the wound and the type of coexistent injury to other organs, and that primary repair of the tracheal wound can be carried out in the majority of the patients."

        "abstract": "Complications after tracheal repair in the past have included wound infections, tracheal stenosis, \"spitting\" of sutures, and tracheoesophageal fistulas. Modern operative approaches have significantly decreased the incidence of these complications. We conducted retrospective data collection using the TRACS database. Changes that preceded the time interval of the study included the following: 1) an emphasis on clinical (rather than endoscopic) recognition of injury; 2) minimal peritracheal dissection and repair with absorbable sutures; 3) limited use of \"protective\" tracheostomies; and 4) use of muscle buttresses to cover tracheal repairs, especially in patients with combined injuries. From 1997 to 2010, 22 patients were treated for wounds to the trachea (cervical 20, thoracic 2). The mechanism of injury was a gunshot wound in 15 patients and a stab wound in seven. A clinical diagnosis of the need for cervical operation or of a tracheal injury was made in 19 patients (86%), whereas three patients had positive diagnostic studies. Direct tracheal repair (No. 19) or evaluation of a superficial injury (No. 1) was performed in 20 patients, and three (15%) had a tracheostomy performed. Combined injuries were present in 12 patients (55%), most commonly to the esophagus (10 of 12 [83%]), and 10 of these 12 patients had vascularized buttresses applied to the tracheal repair. There were seven significant complications in patients with combined injuries to the esophagus or carotid artery. One patient (4.5%) died. Patients with penetrating tracheal injuries most commonly present with overt findings. Modern techniques of repair have eliminated many of the complications noted in the past."

In this study, experience with BBD using a valvuloplasty balloon catheter in the combined treatment (with Nd-YAG laser photoresection and stenting) of severe benign postintubation tracheal stenoses in three adults is delineated. BBD was particularly successful in establishing tracheal patency when laser photoresection was contraindicated or was too dangerous; BBD allowed easy insertion of tracheal stents and the \"opening\" of folded silicone stents. BBD is a simple, inexpensive, safe, and efficient adjunct in the combined treatment of severe postintubation rigid tracheal stenosis in selected adults."

The most common causes are overinflation ofendotracheal tube cuffs and multiple intubation attempts in emergency cases. The diagnosis is based on clinical and radiological suspicion of tracheal injury confirmed by fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Decision between conservative and surgical management of the injury depends on clinical presentation (respiratory instability, concomitant diseases), lesion characteristics (lesion site, size, and number), and time elapsed from injury to diagnosis. We present three cases ofpost-intubation tracheal injury. In two cases, the patients were treated conservatively; in the third case, the patient died from asphyxia caused by thrombus occlusion of the trachea after a longitudinal tracheal lesion. Pre-anesthetic examination did not indicate any possibility of difficult intubation in any of the patients; however, in one of the patients admitted through the emergency department, emergency intubation was performed."

Compressive symptoms, frequent in substernal and cancerous goiters, were present in 11.0% of the patients, although a low rate of dyspnea (2.7%) was observed. In large goiters, some orotracheal intubations were difficult. In such cases, the transtracheal approach can also be difficult, so failure should be anticipated. Postoperative causes of respiratory obstruction included local hemorrhages, bilateral recurrent nerve palsies, and laryngeal edema. A tracheal collapse was not observed. These respiratory obstructions led to repeat surgery in 11 patients, tracheostomy in 3, and temporary reintubation with steroid therapy in 1. The recurrent laryngeal nerve, which may have been affected preoperatively, was found to be damaged postoperatively in 0.5% of the patients with benign goiters, compared to 10.6% of the patients with thyroid cancer. In this last group a bilateral palsy was observed in 3 cases with prolonged or extensive surgery. After these short-term orotracheal intubations (114 minutes on average), injuries of the airway caused by the endotracheal tube were found in 4.6% of the patients."

After convex endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided transbronchial biopsy of the subcarinal lymph node station (station no. 7), it was noted that a laceration had occurred in the left mainstem bronchus. The tear occurred at the medial cartilaginous-membranous junction, seemed to be full thickness into the mediastinum, and was approximately 1.5cm long. The cytologic results of all lymph node biopsies were negative and the patient underwent right upper and middle lobe bilobectomy 12 hours after the EBUS procedure. This is the first report of a serious airway injury occurring during convex EBUS lymph node biopsy."

We describe our experience using self-expanding metallic stents to treat post-lung transplant bronchial dehiscence. From January 1995 to June 2004, 189 single and 118 double lung transplants were performed in our institution, totaling 425 at-risk bronchial anastomoses. Seven (1.6%) incidents of life-threatening bronchial dehiscence were treated with self-expanding metallic stents. The interval between transplant and diagnosis of dehiscence was 29.1 +/- 18.5 days. All patients presented with respiratory distress, and three required mechanical ventilation. Self-expanding metallic stent placement resulted in complete bronchial healing. All three patients with respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation were successfully weaned after stent placement. In two later cases, the stents were electively removed after adequate healing of the dehiscence. Complications included stent migration (one patient) and in-stent stenosis (three patients). Two of these patients required repeat stent insertion after removal, due to bronchomalacia. In patients with life-threatening bronchial dehiscence, self-expanding metallic stents offer prospects for a successful outcome. Self-expanding metallic stents are known to be associated with significant granulation tissue formation, and this property provides a platform for healing of dehiscence and, in time, peribronchial soft tissue grows in to cover the defect, allowing stent removal."

As use of SEMS has increased, the number of patients returning to hospital for management of SRCs has similarly risen. A small group of these patients will have, as their only therapeutic option, stent removal Thus far limited experience exists with late stent removal. Stent extraction is difficult and requires expertise in a variety of techniques. A multidisciplinary approach to both SEMS placement and extraction is strongly advocated."

Tracheal disruption should be considered in any patient with subcutaneous emphysema and respiratory distress after tracheal extubation and confirmed with bronchoscopy. Conservative management may be appropriate for those with small tears, hemodynamic stability, and the ability to isolate the tear from positive pressure ventilation."

We were successfully able to treat this patient conservatively up until the time that tracheostomy was warranted. We discuss and review tracheobronchial injuries with respect to etiology, risk factors, and management and hope to benefit health care providers managing airways in patients at risk for tracheal injury."

The most likely cause of tracheal injury is massive overinflation of the endotracheal tube cuff and pre-existing tracheal wall weakness. We review the relevant literature and predisposing factors contributing to this complication. Only articles that reported at least the demographic data (age and sex), the treatment performed and the outcome were included. Papers that did not detail these variables were excluded. We also focus on a case of tracheal laceration after tracheal intubation in a patient with severe thyroid carcinoma. This patient received surgical repair and recovered uneventfully. Two hundred and eight studies that reported cases or case series were selected for analysis. Most of the reported cases (57&#xb7;2%) showed an uneventful recovery after surgical therapy. The overall mortality was 19&#xb7;2% (40 patients). Our patient too recovered without any serious complication. Careful prevention, early detection and proper treatment of the problem are necessary when tracheal rupture occurs. The morbidity and mortality associated with tracheal injury mandate a high level of suspicion and expedient management."

By definition, the employed imaging technique in the emergency setting should reach the correct diagnosis as fast as possible. In severe chest blunt trauma, multidetector computer tomography (MDCT) has become part of the initial workup, mainly due to its high sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy of the technique for the detection and characterization of thoracic injuries and also due to its wide availability in tertiary care centers. The aim of this paper is to review and illustrate a spectrum of characteristic MDCT findings of blunt traumatic injuries of the chest including the lungs, mediastinum, pleural space, and chest wall."

CT findings were retrospectively studied in 40 patients with suspected acute mediastinitis, including 28 postoperative patients, five with acute descending necrotizing mediastinitis (ADNM), and seven with suspected post-traumatic perforation of the esophagus. Findings included increased attenuation of mediastinal fat (100%), localized mediastinal fluid collections (55%), free gas bubbles in the mediastinum (57.5%), mediastinal lymph nodes (35%), pericardial effusions (27.5%), pleural effusions (85%), lung infiltrates (35%), sternal dehiscence (40%), and pleuromediastinal fistula (2.5%). The sensitivity and specificity of CT in postoperative patients in the first 17 days was 100% and 33% respectively, and after day 17, 100% and 90%. In patients with ADNM sensitivity was 100% while in patients with suspected esophageal perforation sensitivity and specificity were 100%. CT is a highly sensitive technique for the detection of mediastinitis of various causes. For the postoperative patients there is clear time dependence for CT interpretation and accuracy. In patients with suspected ADNM, and traumatic esophageal perforation CT is highly specific early after clinical presentation."

In such a case, primary initial goals are to stabilize the airway and localize the injury and then determine its extend. These can be possible mostly with flexible bronchoscopy conducted by a surgeon who can repair the injury. Most of the penetrating injuries occur in the cervical region. On the other hand, most of the blunt injuries occur in the distal trachea and right main bronchus and they can be best approached by right posterolateral thoracotomy. The selection of the manner and time of approaching depends on the existence and severity of additional injuries. Most of the injuries can be restored by deploying simple techniques such as individual sutures, while some of them requires complex reconstruction techniques. Apart from paying attention to the pulmonary toilet, follow-up is crucial for determination of anastomotic technique or stenosis. Conservative treatment may be considered an option with a high probability of success in patients meeting the criteria, especially in patients with iatrogenic tracheobronchial injury."

At the end of the procedure, the patient presented with subcutaneous emphysema and cyanosis, abdominal distension, and bradycardia. A rigid bronchoscopy showed a longitudinal laceration in the pars membranacea of the trachea. A tracheal silicon stent was positioned on an emergency basis. She was intubated, positioning the tracheal tube cuff distal of the stent under bronchoscopic vision. A computed tomographic scan performed immediately after the procedure showed left pneumothorax, pneumoperitoneum, pneumopericardium, and diffuse subcutaneous emphysema. The subsequent course of the patient was uneventful. The patient was discharged home on postoperative day 4. After 1 year, the stent was removed with the evidence of complete trachel healing."

We describe a case of tracheal injury recognized in the operative period of an open transhiatal esophagectomy for squamous cell carcinoma of the mid to distal esophagus. When injury was discovered, attempts to improve oxygenation and ventilation by conventional methods were unsuccessful. Therefore, peripheral ECMO was used to support oxygenation during the tracheal defect repair. The use of ECMO for the repair of a tracheal injury during esophagectomy is very uncommon but, in our case, provided adequate oxygenation and ventilation while the surgeon repaired the injury and the patient was able to be promptly weaned from ECMO support and extubated not long after."

Transhiatal esophagectomy should be avoided in patients with proximal esophageal tumors who underwent neoadjuvant therapy, and percutaneous tracheostomy should be avoided in patients with short, thick necks. Early recognition leads to improved outcomes. Patients present with a sudden loss in airway pressure, air leaking into the operative field, or mediastinal and subcutaneous emphysema. Treatment starts with airway control. Primary buttressed repair is recommended, through either a left cervical incision for proximal injuries or a right thoracotomy for distal injuries. Nonoperative management has been used safely in select patients injured during intubation or tracheostomy."

Ten female subjects, one male subject, and one child (age range, 8 to 72 years), all of whom had undergone intratracheal intubation, were admitted to the hospital. Four patients had been intubated with a double-lumen catheter (two Carlens type with carinal spur, two Robertshaw without spur), and seven had had \"high volume-low pressure\" tubes, placed under emergency conditions in three of those seven cases. In one further case, an unsuccessful attempt of percutaneous tracheostomy had been made. The localization of the ruptures (all of them longitudinally in the membranaceous wall; length, 2 to 13 cm; mean, 7 cm) comprised both cervical and intrathoracic trachea in seven, the intrathoracic trachea in three instances, and the left main stem bronchus in two cases. Ten patients had mediastinal and subcutaneous emphysema, seven presented with a pneumothorax, and nine had intratracheal bleeding. The interval until the onset of symptoms and diagnoses differed widely: twice diagnoses were made intraoperatively, during thoracic surgery. The longest interval until diagnosis was 5 days; only then did the patient show subcutaneous emphysema and have retrosternal pain. All patients had surgical repair. Nine recovered without sequelae, and three died of septic multiorgan failure."

In the case reported here, a simple method of treating this complication was used that involved a mediastinoscopy incision. Suturing of the tear is carried out easily through a vertical incision made in the anterior wall of the trachea, which is then closed with no further consequences. The patient made a quick recovery, and the cosmetic result was excellent."

Assessment with an optical telescope through the tracheal stoma revealed a 5-cm laceration in the membranous wall of the trachea starting immediately above the carina. The laceration was closed using continuous 4-0 monofilament polydioxanone sutures with direct visualization of tissues through a fiberoptic telescope. This approach is particularly effective in cases of traumatic rupture of the membranous trachea."

        "abstract": "Overall survival rates of lung transplantation have improved since the first human lung transplantation was performed. A decline in the incidence of airway complications (AC) had been a key feature to achieve the current outcomes. Several proposed risk factors to the development of airway complications have been identified, ranging from the surgical technique to the immunosuppressive regimen. There are essentially six different airway complications post-lung transplantation. The most frequently reported complication is bronchial stenosis. Other complications include bronchial dehiscence, exophytic excessive granulation tissue formation, tracheo-bronchomalacia, bronchial fistulas, and endobronchial infections. The management of post-transplant bronchial complications needs a multispecialty team approach. Prevention of some complications may be possible by early and aggressive medical management as well as by using certain surgical techniques for transplantation. Interventional bronchoscopic procedures, including balloon bronchoplasty, cryotherapy, laser photoresection, electrocautery, high-dose endobronchial brachytherapy, and bronchial stents are among the armamentarium. Also, medical management, like antibiotic prophylaxis and therapy for endobronchial infections, or noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation in case of bronchomalacia, are used to treat an AC. In some cases, different surgical approaches are occasionally required. In this article we review the risk factors, the clinical presentation, the diagnostic methods, as well as the management options of the most common AC after lung transplantation."

        "abstract": "The use of metallic airway stents for the treatment of benign airway stenosis is increasingly advocated; however, the long-term safety and efficacy of these devices has not been established. Three case studies involving late but significant proximal tracheal stent complications are reported: 1 related to proximal mechanical stent failure and 2 related to obstructing granulation tissue and stenosis at the proximal stent orifice. Placement of these stents in close proximity to the cricotracheal junction is thought to be primarily responsible for these complications as a result of the excess shearing forces created at the stent-mucosal interface by the differential motion of the stent relative to the rigid subglottic airway and the more distensible trachea. Although the use of metallic stents remains appropriate in cases in which there is a defined and relatively short-term end point for treatment, caution is urged in using them in the proximal trachea for long-term management of benign airway disease."

Critically-ill patients (n = 2833) suffering from cardiovascular, pulmonary, metabolic, neurologic, or trauma-related deterioration were entered into an emergency intubation quality improvement database. This practice analysis was evaluated for airway and hemodynamic-related complications based on a set of defined variables that were correlated to the number of attempts required to successfully intubate the trachea outside the operating room. There was a significant increase in the rate of airway-related complications as the number of laryngoscopic attempts increased (&lt;/=2 versus &gt;2 attempts): hypoxemia (11.8% versus 70%), regurgitation of gastric contents (1.9% versus 22%), aspiration of gastric contents (0.8% versus 13%) bradycardia (1.6% versus 21%), and cardiac arrest (0.7% versus 11%; P &lt; 0.001). Although predictable, this analysis provides data that confirm the number of laryngoscopic attempts is associated with the incidence of airway and hemodynamic adverse events. These data support the recommendation of the ASA Task Force on the Management of the Difficult Airway to limit laryngoscopic attempts to three in lieu of the considerable patient injury that may occur."

Program directors and certifying bodies need guidance to create standards for training programs. Little well-developed literature on the topic exists."

A SEMS can also hold more complex shapes down the length of the trachea or bronchi. Such contouring is dif /uniFB01 cult to achieve with silicone stents (Fig 3). The principle behind this approach is similar to that used in the treatment of tracheobronchial dehiscence following lung transplantation. Tracheal stent placement can be used successfully even in cases that would have been historically treated via a surgical approach. 47,48,65,66 After 4 to 6 weeks of adequate healing these stents can be removed. 24,67-71 The complications associated with long-term stent placement for tracheal injury repair are similar to those for other indications. These include, but are not limited to, infection, stent migration, metal fatigue, granulation tissue formation leading to tracheal stenosis, and mucus plugging. 67,72-75 Hence, these stents should be removed as soon as healing of the tear is noted. Rarely, replacement of a fresh stent may be required because of overwhelming granulation tissue formation compromising the stent ' s patency and safe removal. In poor surgical candidates, bene /uniFB01 ts of minimally invasive interventional techniques appear to far outweigh the risk of complications. There have been reports of successful placement of multiple SEMSs or silicone Y-stents in patients with injury that extends beyond the trachea. 47 In cases where a tracheostomy is part of the injury it may be dif /uniFB01 cult or impossible to place a stent since it may lead to closure of the tracheal stoma.",

The stylet should never extend beyond the tip of the ET tube during intubation to prevent trauma to the upper airways as well as the posterior tracheal wall.
