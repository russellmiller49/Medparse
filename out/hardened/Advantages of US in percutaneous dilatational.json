Prior  studies  (19-21)  have revealed the feasibility of the selection of  more  accurately  sized  endotracheal tubes for pediatric patients on the basis of US measurements of the tracheal dimensions. In our report, we suggest that  measurement  of  the  tracheal  dimensions with US in adults could be an effective  method  to  select  PDT  tubes of  the  most appropriate diameter and length. We used tubes with extra length in  the  proximal  portion  for  patients with  deep-set  tracheas  to  prevent  the complications  caused  by  tubes  of  improper lengths that have been reported by Mallick et al (22)."

Consecutive  inflation  and  deflation  of  the  cuff  accurately  showed the  cuff  level  in  instances  in  which  it was imprecise. The penetration length of  the  seeking  needle  was  limited  to a  calculated  tracheal  depth  to  prevent posterior tracheal wall damage. Chacko et al (8) reported the advantages of US guidance by an introduced cannula and guidewire  insertions  during  PDT;  our findings were similar to those of their study.

        "abstract": "We used portable ultrasound scans to identify relevant anatomical structures in the necks of 30 patients before percutaneous tracheostomy. We identified the tracheal midline, thyroid isthmus and blood vessels and located a safe level for needle insertion. Anterior jugular veins were seen in 15 patients; eight were near the midline and were considered vulnerable. Three veins were more than 4 mm in diameter and these larger vessels were electively ligated. Four patients had arteries which were considered vulnerable to damage. All patients underwent successful percutaneous tracheostomy. Portable ultrasound provides a simple method of screening for vulnerable blood vessels in the neck and for locating the midline before percutaneous tracheostomy. This method is particularly suitable for patients with landmarks that are difficult to visualise or palpate. Based on the ultrasonic findings we can make an informed decision about referral for surgical tracheostomy."

Complication rates associated with surgical tracheostomy are largely related to the restricted possibilities in diagnosis of anatomic variations. Therefore, endoscopic-guided tracheostomy is increasingly being used to enhance precision and safety. The purpose of this study was to assess the ultrasonographic anatomy of the anterior neck with regard to the performance of tracheostomy."

Once in the tracheostomy site, the tube assumes the new role of the upper airway. Consideration of the airway resistance of each tracheostomy tube and change in work of breathing are important in maintaining the respiratory system homeostasis. The airflow dynamics of neonatal, pediatric, and adult tracheostomy tubes were studied. Flow rates were plotted against change in pressure for inspiratory and expiratory flows and resistances for each tube were calculated. The expiratory resistances were larger for the neonatal tubes and pediatric tubes 0 and 00, while inspiratory resistances were the limiting factor in the adult tubes and the larger pediatric tubes. Comparison of calculated resistances of the tracheostomy tubes was made with known physiologic airway resistances. Adult tubes 8 and 10 most closely simulated the upper airway resistance of adults and neonatal tube 0 appeared most appropriate for the newborn. Work of breathing was determined for each tracheostomy tube. Increasing tube diameter as well as decreasing tidal volume and respiratory rate decreased the amount of work required to maintain a given flow."

We measured the depth from the skin surface to the tracheal wall and the angle of the tracheal stoma during percutaneous tracheostomy. In vitro measurements were also performed on standard tracheostomy tubes. Comparison of in vivo and in vitro dimensions demonstrated that standard length tracheostomy tubes are too short for the average critical care patient. We recommend that both the stomal and intratracheal lengths should be made longer by approximately 1 cm and tubes should be redesigned to an angle of 110-120 degrees to allow optimal tracheal placement."

It is widely available, portable, repeatable, relatively inexpensive, pain-free, and safe. In this review article, I describe ultrasonographic anatomy of the upper respiratory organs and present the main potential applications of ultrasonography in airway management. The role of ultrasound in endotracheal tube placement, including preintubation assessment, verification of tube position, double-lumen intubation, and extubation outcome, are explained. Also, ultrasound-guided percutaneous tracheostomy, the role of ultrasound in using the laryngeal mask airway, and upper airway anesthesia are described."

Conditions  presenting a possibility of major complications in six patients, and extremely short necks in three patients, led to the preference for surgical tracheostomy. The radiologist agreed with the clinicians' initial decisions for surgical tracheostomy after US examination in three patients. At  physical  examination,  a  palpated pulsatile vessel along the puncture site (confirmed as a high-located brachiocephalic trunk at US) was a consideration in one patient.

The radiologist agreed with the clinicians' initial decisions for surgical tracheostomy after US examination in three patients.

The radiologist agreed with the clinicians' initial decisions for surgical tracheostomy after US examination in three patients.
