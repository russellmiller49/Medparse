    "abstract": "Procedural setup is an important aspect of any procedure. Interventional pulmonologists provide a procedural practice and have additional expertise in performing high-risk procedures needed in the critically ill patients in intensive care. Taking the time to plan the procedure setup in advance and having all necessary equipment readily available at the patient’s bedside is imperative for procedural services.

Interventional pulmonologists provide a procedural practice and have additional expertise in performing high-risk procedures needed in the critically ill patients in intensive care. Taking the time to plan the procedure setup in advance and having all necessary equipment readily available at the patient's bedside is imperative for procedural services. This is especially essential to ensure patient safety, minimize risk of complications, and improve success for specialized procedures performed by interventional pulmonary in the intensive care unit.

The bronchoscopy tower or disposable bronchoscope screen should be setup at the patient's bedside in the ICU. The patient is placed in a supine position with the ventilator in a controlled mode. Anecdotally, patients' fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) is increased to 100% for the duration of the procedure. FB is typically done at the head of the bed, though it is often also done from the side of the bed especially in intubated patients in ICU. When the operator is at the head end of the bed, the bronchoscopic image visualized on the monitor shows the left mainstem on the left side of the monitor, and the anterior tracheal wall is on the upper part of the screen. This contrasts with the bronchoscopic image when the operator stands at the side of the bed and the bronchoscopic image on the monitor is inverted. With the operator at the side of the bed, the patient's left mainstem is seen on the right side of the monitor and the posterior tracheal wall is now on the upper part of the screen ( Figure 1 ). With the image inversion, the bronchoscopist adjusts for anatomy when performing any therapeutic interventions.

Rigid bronchoscopy (RB) is  used in cases of severe malignant airway obstruction where FB alone will be unsuccessful in recanalization of the airway. In these cases, the ET tube is removed, and a rigid bronchoscope is placed expeditiously.

After all equipment is available and ready, the patient is preoxygenated per protocol and a bite block is placed. The bronchoscope should be preloaded with an ET tube on the outside of it. It is important to well lubricate the scope and the ET tube. If the patient's mouth opening is too small to place a bite block, one can create a 'lollipop' out of multiple pieces of gauze and use that as an ad hoc bite block. In rare circumstances a 2-operator technique is employed. In these circumstances the intensivist (operator #1) inserts the laryngoscope to aid in visualization of the airway by mobilizing oropharyngeal soft tissue. The interventional pulmonologist (operator #2) can then insert the bronchoscope loaded with the ET tube."

An IP team designed to  streamline  PDT practice in an academic setting serves to improve efficiency, reduce procedural time and decrease procedural complications (1). Bronchoscopy is commonly performed at the time of PDT as adjunctive endoscopic visual guidance during the procedure. Most commonly, this is done flexibly, but some practitioners do use rigid bronchoscopes in rare circumstances-most commonly when airway obstruction is present or with very significant expiratory central airway collapse (19). FB is used for direct visualization of the airway and ET tube during tracheostomy needle placement, dilation and final tracheostomy tube placement. Bronchoscopy when used"

However, there is currently some uncertainty regarding the exact role FB during PDT as it adds complexity to the procedure, necessitates a second bronchoscopist, adds cost, and is associated with some negative physiologic consequences such as de-recruitment with subsequent hypoxemia (20). Recent studies question the need for routine bronchoscopy in low-risk patients, especially with the ubiquity and rise of use of ultrasound at time of bronchoscopy (20-23). These studies have reported that complication rates and success of PDT is essentially identical under ultrasound guidance alone as compared to when FB is used. However, these studies are in general, small number of patients. High risk and obese patients are more likely to benefit from bronchoscopic visualization."

Neck ultrasound is informative with regards to preoperative identification of vascular anatomy of the neck, localization of tracheal rings and thyroid isthmus (24). When ultrasound is utilized, a representative tracheal ultrasound image should be obtained ( Figure 6 ). T ypically, a  high  frequency  linear  ultrasound  probe  is  used  to visualize the trachea. Even when used as only an adjunct, pre-procedural ultrasound changes the entry location 25-50% of the time (25,26). FB and US can be used continuously or intermittently with no reported difference in outcomes (27). Figure 7 shows the setup and two operator positions for PDT in an ICU.

The patient's sedation is increased if the patient is not adequately comfortable on the ventilator. The FiO2 on the ventilator is increased to 100%. The next important step is to position the patient. This requires the patient to be supine and to have a large neck roll under the lower cervical spine/shoulders to establish passive neck hyperextension. This will minimize the soft tissue that the operator will have to go through to place the tracheostomy. After equipment is setup and the patient is positioned a time out is performed."

PDT kits are readily available in the ICUs. Ciaglia Blue Rhino (Cook Critical Care, Bloomington, IN, USA) kit was introduced in the market in 1999 and the Ciaglia technique is  the most commonly used technique in North America and worldwide (28). Dilation occurs in a two-step manner, first with a small punch dilator to create a gap in the trachea then via a larger single-beveled curved hydrophilic dilator; both are in the kit. Another commercially available kit is the PercuTwist (Rüsch, T eleflex, Athlone, Ireland). PercuT wist is a single-step screw-type dilator over a guidewire. In both these two kits, the use of a single dilator is associated with reduced tidal volume loss during the procedure (29). Portex Griggs percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy kit (Portex; Hythe, Kent, UK) has largely fallen out of favor. Griggs guidewire dilating forceps technique uses a special forceps (modified Howard Kelly forceps) over a guidewire to result in single step dilatation of soft tissue. The blunt dissection in this procedure was technically more challenging when compared to the Ciaglia technique and was associated with a higher incidence of soft tissue damage and bleeding (30).

Bleeding is known to occur in 2-5% PDT. Injectable lidocaine with epinephrine, extra sutures and silver nitrate should be part of the setup. It is prudent to have a portable cautery pen or device readily available on standby if worsening bleeding is noted intraoperatively."

Interventional pulmonologists provide a procedural practice and have additional expertise in performing high-risk procedures needed in the critically ill patients in intensive care. Taking the time to plan the procedure setup in advance and having all necessary equipment readily available at the patient’s bedside is imperative for procedural services. This is especially essential to ensure patient safety, minimize risk of complications, and improve success for specialized procedures performed by interventional pulmonary in the intensive care unit. In this review we describe the equipment and procedural setup ideal for both pleural and airway procedures. These include flexible diagnostic and therapeutic bronchoscopy, ultrasound guided thoracentesis, chest tube insertion, difficult airway management, and bedside percutaneous dilatation tracheostomy. We provide a guide checklist for these procedures emphasizing the practical aspects of each procedure from selecting the appropriate size endotracheal tube to operator positioning to ensure efficiency and best access. The components of procedural setup are discussed in relation to patient factors that include patient positioning and anesthesia, personnel in the procedure team and the equipment itself. We further briefly describe the additional equipment needed for specialized techniques in therapeutic bronchoscopy used by interventional pulmonologists.",

The dressing is typically a larger size occlusive bandage. For a diagnostic thoracentesis where <50 cc of fluid is to be aspirated, it is possible to do this with only a 21G/22G needle and a syringe after cleaning under local anesthesia. For the operator, gowns, gloves and facemask are arranged separately. If the drainage of pleural fluid is expected to exceed 2 L, additional drainage containers will have to be setup before starting the procedure. Fluid can be safely aspirated using gravity drainage, manual aspiration or active suction. The prepackaged trays include equipment to setup gravity drainage with bag and 3 way stop cock for manual aspiration. Active suction can be performed using vacuum bottles or low wall suction. T o establish drainage under low wall suction, tubing and canister setup like nasogastric tube aspiration is setup and constant pressure of 0 to -80 mm Hg is used. Sterile gloves and mask are the minimum protective gear for the operator.",
          "ssential to have two suctions (one for the bronchoscope and one for oral suctioning). After all equipment is available and ready, the patient is preoxygenated per protocol and a bite block is placed. The bronchoscope should be preloaded with an ET tube on the outside of it. It is important to well lubricate the scope and the ET tube. If the patient's mouth opening is too small to place a bite block, one can create a 'lollipop' out of multiple pieces of gauze and use that as an ad hoc bite block. In rare circumstances a 2-operator technique is employed. In these circumstances the intensivist (operator #1) inserts the laryngoscope to aid in visualization of the airway by mobilizing oropharyngeal soft tissue. The interventional pulmonologist (operator #2) can then insert the bronchoscope loaded with the ET tube.",
          "o localize the location for needle entry within the trachea prevents accidental cannulation into mediastinal structures. However, there is currently some uncertainty regarding the exact role FB during PDT as it adds complexity to the procedure, necessitates a second bronchoscopist, adds cost, and is associated with some negative physiologic consequences such as de-recruitment with subsequent hypoxemia (20). Recent studies question the need for routine bronchoscopy in low-risk patients, especially with the ubiquity and rise of use of ultrasound at time of bronchoscopy (20-23). These studies have reported that complication rates and success of PDT is essentially identical under ultrasound guidance alone as compared to when FB is used. However, these studies are in general, small number of patients. High risk and obese patients are more likely to benefit from bronchoscopic visualization.",
          "wivel adaptor, and different sized sequential dilators. A tracheostomy tube of choice is separately arranged. In obese patients, an extra-long tracheostomy tube is needed. When using an ultrasound, arrange for a sterile probe cover. If using FB, then having bronchoscopy equipment ready alongside dual suction setup is required as well. Bleeding is known to occur in 2-5% PDT. Injectable lidocaine with epinephrine, extra sutures and silver nitrate should be part of the setup. It is prudent to have a portable cautery pen or device readily available on standby if worsening bleeding is noted intraoperatively.",
