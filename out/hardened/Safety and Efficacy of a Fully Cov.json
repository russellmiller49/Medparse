    "abstract": "Background: The use of self-expandable metallic stents (SEMS) in benign airway disease was the object of a boxed warning from the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2005 due to the risk of stent-related complications and difficulties associated with their removal. Third-generation fully covered SEMS have been commercialized since this warning and theoretically should not present the same difficulties associated with removal as they cannot become embedded in the airway mucosa. Objectives: We aimed to examine the safety and efficacy of a specific third-generation SEMS, the Silmet stent. Methods: We reviewed the records of all patients treated for benign airway stenosis with third-generation Silmet SEMS from January 2011 to December 2015 at the North Hospital of Marseilles, France. Results: Forty SEMS were inserted in 30 patients over this period. Twenty (50.0%) stents were removed because of stentrelated complications after a median of 77.0 ± 96.6 days (migration 32.5%, granulation tissue formation 7.5%, sub- rates [3] . The possibility to deploy SEMS with the assistance of flexible bronchoscopy, guidewires, and fluoroscopy, without the use of rigid bronchoscopy required for the deployment of silicone stents, led to a more frequent use of airway stents. Initial publications involved a variety of stents and pathologies [3-5] , but as experience with SEMS grew, long-term complications and difficulties of removal in patients with prolonged survival became apparent even with partially covered stents [6, 7] . This culminated in a boxed warning for the use of SEMS in benign tracheal disease from the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2005 [8] . This warning focused on patients with benign disease due to the prolonged survival in this group, allowing time for complications to develop and cause significant clinical impairment [9] . Three generations of metallic airway stents exist. The first generation is composed of uncovered balloon-expandable metallic stents, the second of partially covered or uncovered SEMS, and the third of fully covered SEMS. Third-generation SEMS were introduced to solve the problem of metallic stent removal. Despite almost a decade of experience with third-generation SEMS, few data have been published on their efficacy, complications, and removability. Marchese et al. [10] recently published their experience with 52 patients obtaining clinically significant symptomatic improvement in all but 1 patient with an acceptable complication rate (migration 13.4%, granulation tissue formation 3.8%, infections 5.7%, obstruction due to tumor outgrowth 15.0%) and successful removal in all 7 cases where it was required. This experience al- most exclusively included malignant airway obstructions (49/52), a situation where second-generation SEMS had previously also performed well. The only available reports of the performance of third-generation SEMS in benign airway disease include a series of 17 patients published by Dooms et al. [11] shortly after the appearance on the market of these stents, demonstrating an unacceptable complication rate at 12 weeks (stent migration 60%, stent fracture 15%, stent shriveling 10%) as well as other small series of post lung transplantation anastomotic strictures treated mainly with AERO stents (Merit Medical Systems, South Jordan, UT, USA) [12-14] . Our clinical experience with fully covered third-generation SEMS in benign airway stenosis is larger than any other previously published series to our knowledge; hence, we decided to review it to evaluate the safety and efficacy of third-generation SEMS in benign airway disease",

[11]  , which may be explained by a difference in experience with the use of third-generation SEMS. We had been using these stents for 5 years prior to the beginning of the study period, while Dooms et al. published their initial experience with a technology which was novel in 2006. With any new stent a learning curve is mandatory, and we cannot always draw conclusions from initial experiences. Experience is especially important for stent sizing, as undersizing  may  lead  to  migration,  while  oversizing  may lead to fracture and metal fatigue. Dooms et al. also included several different third-generation SEMS in their study, and all third-generation SEMS may not be equal in all situations, as their fabrication methods and composition differ   [15]  . This is the reason why we included only one  stent  model  in  our  series.  As  an  example,  certain stents demonstrate less elongation on compression and hence will undergo less stress, putting them at lower risk of cover damage and fracture. Although important, our complication rate can be considered acceptable when put into perspective with the previous failure of other treatment options in the majority of the study population, the successful endoscopic management of all complications, and the absence of stent-related mortality or major complications. All patients had complex airway stenosis unlikely  to  resolve  without stent placement, as previously demonstrated   [18, 19]  . Sixteen (53.3%) patients had previously been treated with silicone stents and treatment had failed in all cases because of stent-related complications. The largest series of endoscopic treatment of benign airway stenosis with silicone stents demonstrated a complication rate of 30.1%   [20]  , which is lower than in our  series  with  covered  SEMS,  but  complication  and treatment  success  rates  would  likely  have  decreased  if SEMS had been used routinely at our institution as a firstline treatment of complex benign airway stenosis."

This difference may be of clinical interest in the treatment of tracheal disease, where the largest  diameter  of  silicone  stent  commercially  available may be insufficient, increasing the risk of migration. Our previous work showed a lower risk of migration with Silmet stents than with silicone stents in dynamic A-shape tracheal stenosis, a situation where large tracheal stents are needed   [22]  . In our experience, certain SEMS, such as Silmet stents, also have less axial stiffness than silicone stents and adapt better to the shape of tortuous airways."

To our knowledge, no previous studies have compared these methods, but we feel that rigid bronchoscopy is more efficient. It allows the operator to dilate the airway stenosis using the rigid bronchoscope and to treat potential complications more efficiently. It also allows easier removal of airway stents if necessary. We also feel that direct vision allows more precise positioning and adjustment of the stent's position after it has been released."

Second, we could not directly compare the complication and treatment success rates between SEMS and silicone stents in our population because failure of previous silicone stent treatment was not necessary for treatment with SEMS, although the majority of patients included had previously failed treatment with silicone stents and because patients in whom silicone stent treatment was a success were not included in this study. We stress that comparing the performance of SEMS and silicone stents was not the objective of this study, which was to demonstrate the safety of Silmet stents in benign airway disease and, secondarily, their efficacy. Third, complications may have been missed due to the retrospective nature of the study and the absence  of  systematic  follow-up  bronchoscopy.  On  the other hand, we feel that systematic follow-up bronchoscopies  detect  mainly  clinically  insignificant  complications and that the goal of stenting is symptom palliation, which can be evaluated clinically. Finally, we did not have formal symptomatic and quality of life follow-up questionnaires available,  hence the clinical success rate of SEMS treatments was based on endoscopic aspect after stent positioning and subjective physician questionnaire on followup without the use of formal measurement tools."

Its outside surface bears regularly placed studs to prevent displacement. First results are encouraging. So far, 118 prostheses have been placed in 66 patients. Tolerance was excellent and complications were rare. Migration occurred 12 times: in seven cases an early prototype that was poorly designed had been used. Obstruction was noted in two cases without major problems. Mean follow-up at the time of this writing is three months, with the longest follow-up 19 months."

Thirty-nine metal stent prostheses (6-20 mm in diameter) and 35 Gianturco stents (30 mm in diameter) were used in 55 adult patients with 62 lesions of the trachea (n = 33) or bronchi (n = 29). All lesions except one were endoscopically confirmed to be noninflammatory. Immediately after implantation, radiologic and endoscopic studies verified reestablishment of a satisfactory airway diameter in all patients. At a mean follow-up of 10.35 (range, 3-27) months, improvement in the respiratory status of 49 of the 55 patients (89%) was maintained and tolerance of the device was excellent. For the Wallstent endoprosthesis, the six complications observed at endoscopy were successfully treated. The Gianturco stent, however, led to a high rate of complications: 30% of cases had migration and/or rupture of the metallic mesh, potentially leading to obstruction or wall perforation; one case of respiratory distress was fatal. This procedure offers rapid epithelialization and incorporation of the device into the tracheobronchial wall."

Indications for stenting were tracheobronchomalacia (n=13), neoplasia (n=20), and tracheal stenosis (n=4). Airway patency was restored in all patients. Symptoms improved in all but one patient. The median follow-up for all patients and the group of 16 patients alive has been 21 and 69.5 weeks, respectively. Complications have included granulomas and bronchitis. Migration or mucus plugging was not encountered. We conclude that metallic stents can be inserted safely using a flexible bronchoscope. At least in the short term, major complications are uncommon."

Strictures recurred in all patients 1, 3, and 5 months after stent deployment. Attempts at stent retrieval were successful for three of five devices. The use of AERO stents may not offer a therapeutic advantage versus balloon dilation of bronchus intermedius strictures in lung transplant recipients."

Luminal compromise beyond 50% often leads to debilitating symptoms such as dyspnea. Silicone stents remain the most commonly placed stents worldwide and have been the \"gold standard\" for the treatment of benign and malignant airway stenoses over the past 20 years. Nevertheless, silicone stents are not the ideal stents in all situations. Metallic stents can serve better in some selected conditions. Unlike silicone stents, there are large and increasing varieties of metallic stents available on the market. The lack of prospective or comparative studies between various types of metallic stents makes the choice difficult and expert-opinion based. International guidelines are sorely lacking in this area."

Endoscopic management is used for inoperable patients with 17% to 69% success. Dynamic \"A-shape\" tracheal stenosis (DATS) results in a dynamic stenosis with anterior fracture of tracheal cartilage and frequently associated posterior malacia. We report the results of our multidisciplinary management."

          "ates   [3]  . The possibility to deploy SEMS with the assistance of flexible bronchoscopy, guidewires, and fluoroscopy, without the use of rigid bronchoscopy required for the deployment of silicone stents, led to a more frequent use of airway stents. Initial publications involved a variety of  stents  and  pathologies    [3-5]  ,  but  as  experience  with SEMS grew, long-term complications and difficulties of removal in patients with prolonged survival became apparent even with partially covered stents   [6, 7]  . This culminated in a boxed warning for the use of SEMS in benign tracheal disease from the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2005   [8]  . This warning focused on patients with benign disease due to the prolonged survival in this group, allowing time for complications to develop and cause significant clinical impairment   [9]  .",

The only available reports of the performance of third-generation SEMS in benign airway disease include a series of 17 patients published by Dooms et al.

Our clinical experience with fully covered third-generation SEMS in benign airway stenosis is larger than any other previously published series to our knowledge; hence, we decided to review it to evaluate the safety and efficacy of third-generation SEMS in benign airway disease.",

Stenosis with an element of malacia was classified  as  complex    [15]  .  The  usual  follow-up  for  stents  in  benign airway  disease  at  our  institution  includes  visits  at  1,  6,  and  12 months,  then  annually.  No  systematic  follow-up  bronchoscopy was performed unless the patient was symptomatic. Stent removal was attempted after 6-12 months unless the patient was felt to be at too high risk of stenosis recurrence.",
          "as repeatedly plugged with mucus requiring bronchoscopy, and 1 (2.5%) was removed urgently 24 h after deployment because of laryngeal edema. There were no cases of stent shriveling or fracture. No mortality was associated with stent complications. All complications were managed endoscopically with success. In the case of laryngeal edema, the stent was removed and a tracheostomy tube was reinserted as prior to the airway stent insertion procedure. Nine of the 10 (90.0%) patients who had stent  migration  had  a  history  of  stent  migration  when previously treated with silicone stents.",
          "omplications after a follow-up of 433 and 455 days, respectively. Two patients (6.7%) died of unrelated causes with their stent in place without any stent-related complication. No patients were lost to follow-up with an SEMS in place. The clinical success rate of SEMS treatment was 11/27 (40.7%). It did not differ statistically significantly according to type of stenosis, site of stenosis, Odds ratio (or) presence Odds ratio (or) absence of previous treatments ( p = 0.39, p = 0.55, and p = 0.37, respectively).",

This difference may be of clinical interest in the treatment of tracheal disease, where the largest  diameter  of  silicone  stent  commercially  available may be insufficient, increasing the risk of migration. Our previous work showed a lower risk of migration with Silmet stents than with silicone stents in dynamic A-shape tracheal stenosis, a situation where large tracheal stents are needed   [22]  . In our experience, certain SEMS, such as Silmet stents, also have less axial stiffness than silicone stents and adapt better to the shape of tortuous airways.",

Further  studies  are needed to compare the performance of third-generation SEMS and silicone stents in benign airway stenosis.",
          "ates   [3]  . The possibility to deploy SEMS with the assistance of flexible bronchoscopy, guidewires, and fluoroscopy, without the use of rigid bronchoscopy required for the deployment of silicone stents, led to a more frequent use of airway stents.

          "ates   [3]  . The possibility to deploy SEMS with the assistance of flexible bronchoscopy, guidewires, and fluoroscopy, without the use of rigid bronchoscopy required for the deployment of silicone stents, led to a more frequent use of airway stents. Initial publications involved a variety of  stents  and  pathologies    [3-5]  ,  but  as  experience  with SEMS grew, long-term complications and difficulties of removal in patients with prolonged survival became apparent even with partially covered stents   [6, 7]  . This culminated in a boxed warning for the use of SEMS in benign tracheal disease from the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2005   [8]  . This warning focused on patients with benign disease due to the prolonged survival in this group, allowing time for complications to develop and cause significant clinical impairment   [9]  .",

The only available reports of the performance of third-generation SEMS in benign airway disease include a series of 17 patients published by Dooms et al.   [11] shortly after the appearance on the market of these stents, demonstrating an unacceptable complication rate at 12 weeks (stent migration 60%, stent fracture 15%, stent shriveling 10%) as well as other small series  of  post  lung  transplantation anastomotic strictures treated  mainly  with  AERO  stents  (Merit  Medical  Systems, South Jordan, UT, USA)   [12-14]  . Our clinical experience with fully covered third-generation SEMS in benign airway stenosis is larger than any other previously published series to our knowledge; hence, we decided to review it to evaluate the safety and efficacy of third-generation SEMS in benign airway disease.",

Stenosis with an element of malacia was classified  as  complex    [15]  .  The  usual  follow-up  for  stents  in  benign airway  disease  at  our  institution  includes  visits  at  1,  6,  and  12 months,  then  annually.  No  systematic  follow-up  bronchoscopy was performed unless the patient was symptomatic.

There were no cases of stent shriveling or fracture. No mortality was associated with stent complications. All complications were managed endoscopically with success. In the case of laryngeal edema, the stent was removed and a tracheostomy tube was reinserted as prior to the airway stent insertion procedure.

This difference may be of clinical interest in the treatment of tracheal disease, where the largest  diameter  of  silicone  stent  commercially  available may be insufficient, increasing the risk of migration. Our previous work showed a lower risk of migration with Silmet stents than with silicone stents in dynamic A-shape tracheal stenosis, a situation where large tracheal stents are needed   [22]  . In our experience, certain SEMS, such as Silmet stents, also have less axial stiffness than silicone stents and adapt better to the shape of tortuous airways.",
