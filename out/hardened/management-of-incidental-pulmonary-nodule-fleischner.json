Since then, new information  has  become  available;  therefore,  the  guidelines have been revised to reflect current thinking on nodule management. The revised guidelines incorporate several substantive changes that reflect current thinking on the management of small nodules. The minimum threshold size for routine follow-up has been increased, and recommended follow-up intervals are now given as a range rather than as a precise time period to give radiologists, clinicians, and patients greater discretion to accommodate individual risk factors and preferences. The guidelines for solid  and  subsolid  nodules  have  been  combined  in  one simplified table, and specific recommendations have been included for multiple nodules. These guidelines represent the consensus of the Fleischner Society, and as such, they incorporate  the  opinions  of  a  multidisciplinary  international group of thoracic radiologists, pulmonologists, surgeons, pathologists, and other specialists. Changes from the previous guidelines issued by the Fleischner Society are based on new data and accumulated experience."

These are followed by  graded  ratings  of  each  recommendation  using  the  American  College  of Chest Physicians recommendations for  evidence  grading  in  clinical  guidelines  (9).  Additional  explanations  are provided  regarding  the  rationale  for each recommendation, which is based on  the  consensus  of  a  multidisciplinary  team  and  a  systematic  review  of the literature, further details of which are included in Appendix E1 [online]. The minimum threshold size for recommending follow-up is based on an estimated cancer risk in a nodule on the order of 1% or greater. This criterion is necessarily arbitrary, and we recognize that a higher threshold may be considered appropriate in some environments and  that  this  threshold  will  ultimately depend on social and economic factors. Several  general  considerations  regarding  technical  aspects  of  using  these recommendations  are  also  presented. Finally, in Appendix E1 (online), additional  information  regarding  methods and risk factors is given."

Also, because  lung  cancer  is  rare  in  children and adults younger than 35 years, these guidelines are not appropriate for such patients.  When incidental nodules are encountered  in  young  patients,  management decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis, and the physician should recognize that infectious causes are  more  likely  than  cancer  and  that use of serial CT should be minimized. Most nodules smaller than 1 cm will not be  visible  on  chest  radiographs;  however,  for  larger  solid  nodules  that  are clearly  visualized  and  are  considered low  risk,  follow-up  with  radiography rather than CT may be appropriate to take  advantage  of  the  lower  cost  and lower radiation exposure."

The purpose of these recommendations is to reduce the number of unnecessary follow-up examinations while providing greater discretion  to  the  radiologist,  clinician,  and patient to make management decisions. Thus,  a  range  of  times  rather  than  a specific interval for follow-up computed tomography (CT) is given for many scenarios. This change has been made in recognition of the multiple factors that determine risk and that cannot be easily incorporated into a summary table, as well as the important role of patient preference  for  either  more  aggressive or more conservative management. Although we have taken into account new data from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), Nederlans-Leuvens Longkanker  Screenings  Onderzoek  (NELSON), International Early Lung Cancer Action  Program  (iELCAP),  Pan-Canadian  Early  Detection  of  Lung  Cancer Study (PanCan), and British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA) cancer screening trials, all of which support the use of less aggressive management of small nodules,  we  recognize  that  screening programs have defined protocols to educate  candidates  about  potential  risks and the need for consistent monitoring, whereas incidentally identified nodules represent a separate population that requires a more varied approach to clinical management (3-7)."

There  is  a  paucity  of  direct evidence  regarding  cancer  probability in small nodules in low-clinical-risk situations. However, there is abundant evidence for cancer risk in current smokers or those who recently quit smoking and who  have  been  studied  in  the  context of lung cancer screening programs. The risk of cancer in patients who have never  smoked  and  in  younger  patients is known to be significantly lower, with a  relative  risk  on  the  order  of  0.15  in the United States when compared with risk in heavy smokers in the case of solid nodules (21). Given that the average risk of cancer in solid nodules smaller than 6 mm in patients at high risk is less than 1%, it is reasonable to assume an even lower risk in a patient with low clinical risk  (7,22).  This  recommendation  is consistent  with  our  policy  of  excluding nodules with a less than 1% risk of cancer from routine CT follow-up."

These revised guidelines increase the size threshold for routine follow-up of solid nodules to 6 mm. This change is based on supporting data from several screening trials that indicate the risk of cancer in nodules smaller than 6 mm is considerably  less  than  1%,  even  in  patients at high risk (6,7).

Thus, the size threshold ( , 6 mm) corresponds to a rounded measurement of 5 mm or less in these guidelines. As an alternative  to  manual  linear  measurements,  automated  or  semiautomated volumetric measurements can be used, and  they  have  the  advantage  of  being more  reproducible  than  manual  techniques (17). Volume thresholds of 100 and  250  mm 3   are  used  for  volumetry instead of the 6- and 8-mm thresholds used  for  linear  measurements.  However, volumetry is substantially dependent on the specific software used (18,19).  For  this  reason,  volumetric measurements to assess nodule growth should be performed  with  identical software  versions.  More  comprehensive recommendations on nodule measurements, including a full discussion of technical and observer-related factors, will  be  provided  in  a  separate  White Paper from the Fleischner Society that is currently in preparation."

Prediction models used to estimate malignancy yield better  results  with  the  average  diameter than with  the  maximum  transverse diameter (16). The Fleischner Society has  recommended  use  of  the  average diameter since 2005, as the average of long and short axes more accurately reflects  three-dimensional  tumor  volume (1). For larger nodules and for masses larger than 10 mm, it is generally appropriate  to  record  both  long-  and short-axis  dimensions,  with  the  longaxis dimension being used to determine the T factor in lung cancer staging and being  a  criterion  for  tumor  response to treatment.

In these guidelines, nodules are further divided into solid, ground-glass, and part-solid categories. However, the criteria  for  making  these  distinctions have not been completely agreed upon and remain controversial. Van Riel et al (59)  examined  the  agreement  between experienced  thoracic  radiologists  using traditional  subjective  criteria  to  assign nodules to solid, pure ground-glass, and part-solid categories. Both inter- and intraobserver agreement was found to be highly variable in these nodules. Correct classification of nodules as solid or subsolid by all radiologists was achieved in only 58% of cases (59). Nonetheless, it is generally agreed that nodules that are rendered partially invisible when viewed on thin sections with mediastinal (softtissue) window settings and a sharp filter can be regarded as subsolid and that any nodule components other than normal vascular or bronchial structures that remain visible on such images are solid. Small  solid  or  semisolid  components that represent early signs of invasive adenocarcinoma may be rendered invisible"

        "abstract": "Calcium concentration may be a useful feature for distinguishing benign from malignant lung nodules in computer-aided diagnosis. The calcium concentration can be estimated from the measured CT number of the nodule and a CT number vs calcium concentration calibration line that is derived from CT scans of two or more calcium reference standards. To account for CT number nonuniformity in the reconstruction field, such calibration lines may be obtained at multiple locations within lung regions in an anthropomorphic phantom. The authors performed a study to investigate the effects of patient body size, anatomic region, and calibration nodule size on the derived calibration lines at ten lung region positions using both single energy (SE) and dual energy (DE) CT techniques. Simulated spherical lung nodules of two concentrations (50 and 100 mg/cc CaCO3) were employed. Nodules of three different diameters (4.8, 9.5, and 16 mm) were scanned in a simulated thorax section representing the middle of the chest with large lung regions. The 4.8 and 9.5 mm nodules were also scanned in a section representing the upper chest with smaller lung regions. Fat rings were added to the peripheries of the phantoms to simulate larger patients. Scans were acquired on a GE-VCT scanner at 80, 120, and 140 kVp and were repeated three times for each condition. The average absolute CT number separations between the calibration lines were computed. In addition, under- or overestimates were determined when the calibration lines for one condition (e.g., small patient) were used to estimate the CaCO3 concentrations of nodules for a different condition (e.g., large patient). The authors demonstrated that, in general, DE is a more accurate method for estimating the calcium contents of lung nodules. The DE calibration lines within the lung field were less affected by patient body size, calibration nodule size, and nodule position than the SE calibration lines. Under- or overestimates in CaCO3 concentrations of nodules were also in general smaller in quantity with DE than with SE. However, because the slopes of the calibration lines for DE were about one-half the slopes for SE, the relative improvement in the concentration estimates for DE as compared to SE was about one-half the relative improvement in the separation between the calibration lines. Results in the middle of the chest thorax section with large lungs were nearly completely consistent with the above generalization. On the other hand, results in the upper-chest thorax section with smaller lungs and greater amounts of muscle and bone were mixed. A repeat of the entire study in the upper thorax section yielded similar mixed results. Most of the inconsistencies occurred for the 4.8 mm nodules and may be attributed to errors caused by beam hardening, volume averaging, and insufficient sampling. Targeted, higher resolution reconstructions of the smaller nodules, application of high atomic number filters to the high energy x-ray beam for improved spectral separation, and other future developments in DECT may alleviate these problems and further substantiate the superior accuracy of DECT in quantifying the calcium concentrations of lung nodules."

        "abstract": "The lungs are among the most prominent target organs for metastatic disease. Most frequently, lung metastases originate from cancers of the head and neck, breast, stomach, pancreas, kidney, bladder, the male and female genitourinary tract, and sarcomas. Plain chest radiography is typically the modality used for detection and therapeutic monitoring; however, the use of CT for these purposes is becoming more frequent. Currently, spiral CT appears to be the most sensitive imaging technique in the identification of metastases, because it detects a higher number of pulmonary nodules compared to other techniques. Pulmonary metastatic disease manifests itself by the presence of pulmonary nodules, lymphangitic carcinomatosis, endobronchial tumors, and pleural involvement. Nevertheless, the differential diagnosis is an important consideration, particularly in patients with solitary pulmonary nodules, systemic disorders, and signs or symptoms indicative of infection. The role of the radiologist involves the identification of metastatic disease, monitoring of response to therapy, and the use of invasive procedures when the differential diagnosis indicates the need for biopsy and histopathologic proof. The radiologist must be aware of the impact of his diagnosis on patient management and should be familiar with oncologic strategies as well as the terminology used to characterize tumor response. In future, the role of imaging may further expand due to the increased sensitivity in lesion detection, increased specificity in lesion (tissue) characterization using MR imaging imaging, and reduced radiation exposure."

        "abstract": "The solitary pulmonary nodule is a common radiologic abnormality that is often detected incidentally. Although most solitary pulmonary nodules have benign causes, many represent stage I lung cancers and must be distinguished from benign nodules in an expeditious and cost-effective manner. Evaluation of specific morphologic features of a solitary pulmonary nodule with conventional imaging techniques can help differentiate benign from malignant nodules and obviate further costly assessment. Small size and smooth, well-defined margins are suggestive of but not diagnostic for benignity. Lobulated contour as well as an irregular or spiculated margin with distortion of adjacent vessels are typically associated with malignancy. There is considerable overlap in the internal characteristics (eg, attenuation, cavitation, wall thickness) of benign and malignant nodules. The presence of intranodular fat is a reliable indicator of a hamartoma. The presence and pattern of calcification can also help differentiate benign from malignant nodules. Computed tomography (CT) (particularly thin-section CT) is 10-20 times more sensitive than standard radiography and allows objective, quantitative assessment of calcification. Initial evaluation often results in nonspecific findings, in which case nodules are classified as indeterminate and require further evaluation to exclude malignancy. Growth rate assessment, Bayesian analysis, contrast material-enhanced CT, positron emission tomography, and transthoracic needle aspiration biopsy can be useful in this regard."

        "abstract": "Although most lesions that occur in the chest have a nonspecific soft-tissue appearance, fat-containing lesions are occasionally encountered at cross-sectional computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging. The various fat-containing lesions of the chest include parenchymal and endobronchial lesions such as hamartoma, lipoid pneumonia, and lipoma. Endobronchial hamartoma usually appears at CT as a lesion with a smooth edge, focal collections of fat, or fat collections that alternate with foci of calcification. Mediastinal fat-containing lesions include germ cell neoplasms, thymolipomas, lipomas, and liposarcomas. The most frequent CT manifestation of the germ cell neoplasm teratoma is a heterogeneous mass with soft-tissue, fluid, fat, and calcium attenuation. Cardiac lesions with fat content include lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia. Diagnosis of the former is made with CT when a smooth, nonenhancing, well-marginated fat-containing lesion is identified in the interatrial septum. Finally, fat may herniate into the chest at several characteristic locations. When such a lesion is identified, the time required for differential diagnosis is significantly reduced, often allowing a definitive radiologic diagnosis. Sagittal and coronal reformatted images can add valuable information by showing diaphragmatic defects and hernia contents."

Nodular ground-glass opacity may be observed in malignancies such as bronchioloalveolar carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, as well as in their putative precursors, such as atypical adenomatous hyperplasia. Nodular ground-glass opacity also may be seen in the presence of benign conditions, including focal interstitial fibrosis, inflammation, and hemorrhage. The persistence of nodular ground-glass opacity over time may be strongly suggestive of an early-stage malignancy, especially if the lesion increases in size or includes a solid component that increases in its extent. Persistent nodular ground-glass opacity also may remain stable in size but show increased attenuation. The more extensive the solid portions of the lesion, the higher the probability of malignancy and the poorer the prognosis. An awareness of the clinical setting, in addition to familiarity with the thin-section CT features of nodular ground-glass opacity at initial and follow-up imaging over several months, can help identify malignancy and achieve an accurate diagnosis. A meticulous evaluation of those CT features, and their correlation with specific histopathologic characteristics, also may enable a more accurate prognosis in cases of neoplastic disease."

Of these, an estimated 10 to 15% will be caused by factors other than active smoking, corresponding to 16,000 to 24,000 deaths annually. Thus lung cancer in never smokers would rank among the most common causes of cancer mortality in the United States if considered as a separate category. Slightly more than half of the lung cancers caused by factors other than active smoking occur in never smokers. As summarized in the accompanying article, lung cancers that occur in never smokers differ from those that occur in smokers in their molecular profile and response to targeted therapy. These recent laboratory and clinical observations highlight the importance of defining the genetic and environmental factors responsible for the development of lung cancer in never smokers. This article summarizes available data on the clinical epidemiology of lung cancer in never smokers, and several environmental risk factors that population-based research has implicated in the etiology of these cancers. Primary factors closely tied to lung cancer in never smokers include exposure to known and suspected carcinogens including radon, second-hand tobacco smoke, and other indoor air pollutants. Several other exposures have been implicated. However, a large fraction of lung cancers occurring in never smokers cannot be definitively associated with established environmental risk factors, highlighting the need for additional epidemiologic research in this area."

Management protocols use thresholds for nodule size and growth rate to determine which nodules require additional diagnostic procedures, but these should be based on individuals' probabilities of developing lung cancer. In this prespecified analysis, using data from the NELSON CT screening trial, we aimed to quantify how nodule diameter, volume, and volume doubling time affect the probability of developing lung cancer within 2 years of a CT scan, and to propose and evaluate thresholds for management protocols."

The ACR supports the recommendations of the US Preventive Services Task Force and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network for screening patients. To be effective, lung cancer screening should be performed at sites providing high-quality low-dose CT examinations overseen and interpreted by qualified physicians using a structured reporting and management system. The ACR has developed a set of tools necessary for radiologists to take the lead on the front lines of lung cancer screening. The ACR Lung Cancer Screening Center designation is built upon the ACR CT accreditation program and requires use of Lung-RADS or a similar structured reporting and management system. This designation provides patients and referring providers with the assurance that they will receive high-quality screening with appropriate follow-up care."

        "abstract": "While grading the strength of recommendations and the quality of underlying evidence enhances the usefulness of clinical guidelines, the profusion of guideline grading systems undermines the value of the grading exercise. An American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) task force formulated the criteria for a grading system to be utilized in all ACCP guidelines that included simplicity and transparency, explicitness of methodology, and consistency with current methodological approaches to the grading process. The working group examined currently available systems, and ultimately modified an approach formulated by the international GRADE group. The grading scheme classifies recommendations as strong (grade 1) or weak (grade 2), according to the balance among benefits, risks, burdens, and possibly cost, and the degree of confidence in estimates of benefits, risks, and burdens. The system classifies quality of evidence as high (grade A), moderate (grade B), or low (grade C) according to factors that include the study design, the consistency of the results, and the directness of the evidence. For all future ACCP guidelines, The College has adopted a simple, transparent approach to grading recommendations that is consistent with current developments in the field. The trend toward uniformity of approaches to grading will enhance the usefulness of practice guidelines for clinicians."

Recently, the morphological characteristics, including thin-section CT and pathologic findings, and prognosis of small peripheral lung adenocarcinomas have been studied extensively. The radiologic and microscopic findings correlate well with each other and are closely associated with tumour prognosis. Most importantly, some subtypes of small lung adenocarcinomas with specific CT or pathologic features are curable. Therefore, all defining characteristics (CT, pathologic and prognostic) of this kind of tumour should be integrated to improve our understanding, provide guidelines for management and accurately assess its prognosis."

        "abstract": "Integrating current evidence with fundamental concepts from decision analysis suggests that management of patients with pulmonary nodules should begin with estimating the pretest probability of cancer from the patient's clinical risk factors and computed tomography characteristics. Then, the consequences of treatment should be considered, by comparing the benefits of surgery if the patient has lung cancer with the potential harm if the patient does not have cancer. This analysis determines the \"treatment threshold,\" which is the point around which the decision centers. This varies widely among patients depending on their cardiopulmonary reserve, comorbidities, and individual preferences. For patients with a very low probability of cancer, careful observation with serial computed tomography is warranted. For those with a high probability of cancer, surgical diagnosis is warranted. For patients in the intermediate range of probabilities, either computed tomography-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy or positron emission tomography, possibly followed by computed tomography-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy, is best. Patient preferences should be considered because the absolute difference in outcome between strategies may be small. The optimal approach to the management of patients with pulmonary nodules is evolving as technologies develop. Areas of uncertainty include quantifying the hazard of delayed diagnosis; determining the optimal duration of follow-up for ground-glass and semisolid opacities; establishing the roles of volumetric imaging, advanced bronchoscopic technologies, and limited surgical resections; and calculating the cost-effectiveness of different strategies."

Here we report molecular profiling of 230 resected lung adenocarcinomas using messenger RNA, microRNA and DNA sequencing integrated with copy number, methylation and proteomic analyses. High rates of somatic mutation were seen (mean 8.9 mutations per megabase). Eighteen genes were statistically significantly mutated, including RIT1 activating mutations and newly described loss-of-function MGA mutations which are mutually exclusive with focal MYC amplification. EGFR mutations were more frequent in female patients, whereas mutations in RBM10 were more common in males. Aberrations in NF1, MET, ERBB2 and RIT1 occurred in 13% of cases and were enriched in samples otherwise lacking an activated oncogene, suggesting a driver role for these events in certain tumours. DNA and mRNA sequence from the same tumour highlighted splicing alterations driven by somatic genomic changes, including exon 14 skipping in MET mRNA in 4% of cases. MAPK and PI(3)K pathway activity, when measured at the protein level, was explained by known mutations in only a fraction of cases, suggesting additional, unexplained mechanisms of pathway activation. These data establish a foundation for classification and further investigations of lung adenocarcinoma molecular pathogenesis."

        "abstract": "Exposure to high concentrations of radon progeny (radon) produces lung cancer in both underground miners and experimentally exposed laboratory animals. To determine the risk posed by residential radon exposure, the authors performed a population-based, case-control epidemiologic study in Iowa from 1993 to 1997. Subjects were female Iowa residents who had occupied their current home for at least 20 years. A total of 413 lung cancer cases and 614 age-frequency-matched controls were included in the final analysis. Excess odds were calculated per 11 working-level months for exposures that occurred 5-19 years (WLM(5-19)) prior to diagnosis for cases or prior to time of interview for controls. Eleven WLM(5-19) is approximately equal to an average residential radon exposure of 4 pCl/liter (148 Bq/m3) during this period. After adjustment for age, smoking, and education, the authors found excess odds of 0.50 (95% confidence interval: 0.004, 1.81) and 0.83 (95% percent confidence interval: 0.11, 3.34) using categorical radon exposure estimates for all cases and for live cases, respectively. Slightly lower excess odds of 0.24 (95 percent confidence interval: -0.05, 0.92) and 0.49 (95 percent confidence interval: 0.03, 1.84) per 11 WLM(5-19) were noted for continuous radon exposure estimates for all subjects and live subjects only. The observed risk estimates suggest that cumulative ambient radon exposure presents an important environmental health hazard."

However, the advent of uranium mining in the area has been associated with an increased incidence of lung cancer among Navajo uranium miners. This study centers on Navajo men with lung cancer who were admitted to the hospital from February 1965 to May 1979. Of a total of 17 patients with lung cancer, 16 were uranium miners, and one was a nonminer. The mean value of cumulative radon exposure for this group was 1139.5 working level months (WLMs). The predominant cancer type was the small cell undifferentiated category (62.5 percent). The low frequency of cigarette smoking in this group supports the view that radiation is the primary cause of lung cancer among uranium miners and that cigarette smoking acts as a promoting agent."

        "abstract": "Tobacco use, primarily in the form of cigarettes, is the leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in the United States (U.S.). The adverse effects of tobacco use began to be recognized in the 1940's and new hazards of active smoking and secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure from cigarettes continue to be identified to this day. This has led to a sustained and wide-ranging array of highly effective regulatory, public health, and clinical efforts that have been informed by extensive scientific data, resulting in marked decreases in the use of cigarettes. Unfortunately, the dramatic recent decline in cigarette use in the U.S., has been accompanied by an upsurge in adolescent and young adult use of new, non-cigarette tobacco and nicotine-delivery products, commonly referred to as alternative tobacco products (ATPs). Commonly used ATPs include hookah, cigars, smokeless tobacco, and electronic cigarettes. While there have been a number of review articles that focus on adult ATP use, the purpose of this review is to provide an overview of what is, and is not known about emerging ATP use among U.S. adolescents on a national scale; as well as to identify research gaps in knowledge, and discuss future health and policy needs for this growing public health concern. This paper is not meant to systemically review all published survey data, but to present clear depiction of selected ATP usage in youth populations using national survey data."

We evaluated the risk of lung cancer among CPFE patients compared to IPF and emphysema patients. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who were diagnosed as CPFE, IPF and emphysema using chest CT scans at Seoul National University Hospital from Jan 2000 to Dec 2011. Patients with CPFE were enrolled and matched (1:1:2) with IPF and emphysema patients based on the radiological criteria. The main outcome was time to diagnosis of lung cancer and evaluated with Cox-proportional hazard regression. Forty-eight CPFE, 48 IPF, and 96 emphysema patients were included in this study. Twenty-five cases of lung cancer occurred. The CPFE group had a higher risk of lung cancer (adjusted HR 4.62, 95% CI 1.58-13.55) than that of the emphysema group. Also, IPF group had a higher risk of lung cancer (adjusted HR 4.15, 95% CI 1.03-16.78) than that of emphysema group. However, there was no statistically significant difference in lung cancer risk between the CPFE and IPF group. Additionally, the CPFE group had a higher risk of lung cancer or death (adjusted HR 4.62, 95% CI 2.25-9.47) than that of the emphysema group. In conclusion, patients with CPFE and IPF had a higher risk of lung cancer than those with emphysema, although lung cancer risk was similar between CPFE and IPF."

        "abstract": "Cancer is the leading cause of death among Hispanics/Latinos, who represent the largest racial/ethnic minority group in the United States, accounting for 17.4% (55.4 million/318 million) of the total US population in 2014. Every 3 years, the American Cancer Society reports on cancer statistics for Hispanics based on incidence data from the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics. Among Hispanics in 2015, there will be an estimated 125,900 new cancer cases diagnosed and 37,800 cancer deaths. For all cancers combined, Hispanics have 20% lower incidence rates and 30% lower death rates compared with non-Hispanic whites (NHWs); however, death rates are slightly higher among Hispanics during adolescence (aged 15-19 years). Hispanic cancer rates vary by country of origin and are generally lowest in Mexicans, with the exception of infection-associated cancers. Liver cancer incidence rates in Hispanic men, which are twice those in NHW men, doubled from 1992 to 2012; however, rates in men aged younger than 50 years declined by 43% since 2003, perhaps a bellwether of future trends for this highly fatal cancer. Variations in cancer risk between Hispanics and NHWs, as well as between subpopulations, are driven by differences in exposure to cancer-causing infectious agents, rates of screening, and lifestyle patterns. Strategies for reducing cancer risk in Hispanic populations include increasing the uptake of preventive services (e.g., screening and vaccination) and targeted interventions to reduce obesity, tobacco use, and alcohol consumption."

To estimate high risk, we  recommend  combining  the  ACCP intermediate-risk  (5%-65%  risk)  and high-risk ( . 65% risk) categories.

Volume thresholds of 100 and  250  mm 3   are  used  for  volumetry instead of the 6- and 8-mm thresholds used  for  linear  measurements.  However, volumetry is substantially dependent on the specific software used (18,19).

Because these factors are numerous  and  have  differing  effects on  the  likelihood  of  cancer,  several sophisticated risk prediction  models have  been  developed  (Appendix  E1 [online]).  However,  for  the  purposes of  these  guidelines,  we  recommend that risk be assigned according to the categories  proposed  by  the  American College  of  Chest  Physicians  (ACCP). Low risk, which corresponds to an estimated risk of cancer of less than 5%, is associated with young age, less smoking,  smaller  nodule  size,  regular  margins, and location in an area other than the upper lobe. To estimate high risk, we  recommend  combining  the  ACCP intermediate-risk  (5%-65%  risk)  and high-risk ( . 65% risk) categories. Highrisk  factors  include  older  age,  heavy smoking,  larger  nodule  size,  irregular or spiculated margins, and upper lobe location.

Chiles et al (69) investigated the relationship  between  chronic  obstructive pulmonary disease phenotypes and risk of cancer in indeterminate nodules detected  in  the  NLST  trial  and  found that  emphysema-predominant  chronic obstructive  pulmonary  disease  phenotype and increasing severity of centrilobular emphysema  were  associated with increased risk of malignancy. Pulmonary fibrosis, particularly idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, is also an independent risk factor, with a hazard ratio of approximately 4.2 compared with emphysema alone (70).",
