Airway stenosis occurs in the upper trachea below the glottis, severely affecting the patient's quality of life and occasionally resulting in death due to respiratory failure. STBS is mainly caused by longterm tracheal intubation, tracheotomy, tracheobronchial tuberculosis, trauma, infection, congenital malformations, or inflammatory lesions. With improved surgical techniques, the incidence of secondary benign airway stenosis caused by tracheal intubation and tracheotomy is increasing, as is the incidence of STBS. Among critical patients on intensive care unit (ICU) mechanical ventilation, the incidence of tracheal benign stenosis is reported to be approximately 1% (1). STBS manifestations are complex. Radical surgical resection and reconstruction is an important approach to treating such diseases (2), but whether the surgery should be performed depends on many factors such as the degree and range of airway stenosis and co-infections. In addition, the surgery has high requirements for the patient's basic physical conditions, often combined with many perioperative complications and a high incidence of longterm anastomotic restenosis (3). Shortcomings such as long recovery times after surgery, especially in patients with complications such as lung infections and central nervous system dysfunction, often make these patients unable to tolerate traditional surgery. Palliative tracheotomy greatly influences patients' quality of life; therefore,"

            "text": "treatment choices should be balanced among conservative treatment, interventional therapy, and surgery, relying on close collaboration and consultation with physicians from multiple disciplines while considering the patient's needs and wishes. With bronchoscopic interventions trending, increasing endoscopic interventional treatments (e.g., laser therapy, balloon dilation, cryotherapy, stent implantation, etc.)  have  been  developed, providing safer and more effective treatment options for patients with STBS after tracheotomies. Of these, the Montgomery T-tube (referred to as the T-tube hereafter) is a rigid bronchoscopic insertion considered to be relatively safe, effective, and well-tolerated due to its minimal trauma, easy operation, and rapid symptomatic relief for the patient."

The T-tube was first applied to prevent tracheal stenosis after tracheal surgery (4). Initially, the T-tube used acrylic material, which was too rigid to intubate and severely affected the expectoration function of  tracheal  cilia.  In  1986,  Boston  Medical  Products developed the 'safe-T-tube' and later used an implantable silicone material (5). In its early days, the T-tube was mainly applied to treat acute tracheal injuries and stenosis and in temporary preoperative preparation for tracheal reconstruction or tracheotomy and anastomosis. It was also used for patients with laryngotracheal stenosis unsuitable for surgical treatment and in transitionally treating benign tracheal lesions before surgery (6). Compared with other tracheal stent designs, the T-tube's design features are as"

Moreover, the T-tube surface is highly polished, so scabbing and adhesion are prevented, and the coneshaped connection on the edge provides comfort while preventing granulation tissue hyperplasia. (II) The T-tube's internal branch is used to support and shape the trachea, and the external branch is used to fasten the T-tube, which overcomes the high displacement tendency of the commonly used straight silicone stent. Stent displacement is reported to occur in 6-18% of the patients who are inserted with straight silicone DUMON stents (7,8). Moreover, the ring and groove design of the external branch enables fixing the spacer and utterance valve, which prevents the T-tube's displacement when the patient breathes or talks.

The T-tube diameter should not be too thick or too tight and should be smaller than the airway diameter. Generally, a T-tube with a diameter of 11-14 mm is chosen, and a T-tube with a diameter that is too large increases the risk of granulation tissue hyperplasia on the edge of the T-tube, and compression and ischemia of the tracheal mucosa are prone to causing infection and restenosis, while a T-tube with too small a diameter may lead to sputum clogging, which is not conducive to airway (3).

In addition, too short a distance between the upper end of the T-tube and the glottis may be a factor. Postoperatively, the patient's expectoration ability should be closely monitored and evaluated, and the airway should be moistened daily. The patient should be encouraged to drink water frequently to promote expectoration, and the utterance valve should be mostly closed to prevent luminal dryness and dry sputum ( Figure 6 ). If necessary, dry sputum should be periodically cleaned off the tube wall to prevent it from clogging. Patients should be encouraged to self-expectorate, so they are well prepared for subsequent extubation.",

However, many patients reportedly manifest no complications or intolerance, even with long-term T-tube intubation. Extubating the T-tube is simple and performed under general anesthesia by slowly pulling the side branch to extract the T-tube from the trachea, or by first cutting out the external branch and removing the internal portion with forceps under a rigid bronchoscope. After extubation, the airway condition must be closely monitored, and in cases of luminal stenosis, mucosal membrane congestion, edema, or excessive secretions, a temporary tracheostomy catheter should be placed to ensure safe ventilation. Some reported (22) that after T-tube extubation, a temporary tracheostomy catheter should be inserted, and after a 2-month follow-up, patients should be completely extubated if airway collapse or obstruction do not occur. Otherwise, the T-tube must be reinstalled, or surgery must be performed."

        "abstract": "We aim to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of the cases of postintubation tracheal rupture (PiTR) published in the literature, with the aim of determining the risk factors that contribute to tracheal rupture during endotracheal intubation. A further objective has been to determine the ideal treatment for this condition (surgical repair or conservative management). A MEDLINE review of cases of tracheal rupture after intubation published in the English language and a review of the references in the articles found. The articles included were those that reported at least the demographic data (age and sex), the treatment performed, and the outcome. Those papers that did not detail the above variables were excluded. The search found 50 studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria. These studies included 182 cases of postintubation tracheal rupture. The overall mortality was 22% (40 patients). A statistical analysis was performed determining the relative risk (RR), 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) and/or statistical significance. The analysis was performed on the overall group and after dividing into 2 subgroups: patients in whom the lesion was detected intraoperatively, and other patients. Patient age (p=0.015) and emergency intubation (RR=3.11; 95% CI, 1.81-5.33; p=0.001) were variables associated with an increased mortality. In those patients in whom the PiTR was detected outside the operating theatre (delayed diagnosis), emergency intubation (RR=3.05; 95% CI, 1.69-5.51; p&lt;0.0001), the absence of subcutaneous emphysema (RR=2.17; 95% CI, 1.25-4; p=0.001), and surgical treatment (RR=2.09; 95% CI, 1.08-4.07; p=0.02) were associated with an increased mortality. In addition, age (p=0.1) and male gender (RR=1.89; 95% CI, 0.98-3.63; p=0.13) showed a clear trend towards an increased mortality. PiTR is an uncommon condition but carries a high morbidity and mortality. Emergency intubation is the principal risk factor, increasing the risk of death threefold compared to elective intubation. Conservative treatment is associated with a better outcome. However, the group of patients who would benefit from surgical treatment has not been fully defined. Further studies are required to evaluate the best treatment options."

Of the 4,595 procedures, 1,146 were performed with a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope (Olympus BF-5B2 or BF-B2) under topical anesthesia with tetracaine and procaine, and 3,449 procedures were performed with a rigid bronchoscope under general intravenous anesthesia with hexobarbital (Evipan) using a modified Sanders' technique to ventilate the patients. Complications occurred in 235 procedures (5.1 percent). Major complications that threatened the patient's life and required intensive medical treatment, surgical intervention, or resuscitative measures occurred in 51 procedures (1.1 percent); deaths occurred after 6 procedures (0.1 percent). A comparison of the complications of rigid bronchoscopy and flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy revealed significantly higher rates of complications of fiberoptic bronchoscopy attributable to toxic effects of tetracaine and of complications of rigid bronchoscopy associated with insufficient general anesthesia. With rigid bronchoscopy, the number of major complications induced by diagnostic manipulations through the bronchoscope and the total number of major complications were significantly higher than with flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy."

The tube has been used for palliation in 11 patients with malignant obstruction of the airway, and as the sole treatment or as an adjunct to operation in 36 other patients. Based on the satisfactory results with the use of these tubes, we have utilized silicone stents in the bronchus and bifurcation prostheses at the carina. In the past, we have inserted the T tubes through a tracheostomy stoma. More recently, we have used a technique for endoscopic placement of the T tubes in which the horizontal limb is pulled out through the tracheostomy stoma. This technique facilitates introduction of the tube and maintains the airway during insertion. The use of silicone stents provides an important tool in the management of complicated airway problems, and we anticipate their increased use in the future."

Extubating the T-tube is simple and performed under general anesthesia by slowly pulling the side branch to extract the T-tube from the trachea, or by first cutting out the external branch and removing the internal portion with forceps under a rigid bronchoscope. After extubation, the airway condition must be closely monitored, and in cases of luminal stenosis, mucosal membrane congestion, edema, or excessive secretions, a temporary tracheostomy catheter should be placed to ensure safe ventilation. Some reported (22) that after T-tube extubation, a temporary tracheostomy catheter should be inserted, and after a 2-month follow-up, patients should be completely extubated if airway collapse or obstruction do not occur. Otherwise, the T-tube must be reinstalled, or surgery must be performed.",
