She had no pulmonary symptoms. A chest CT scan showed a 1-cm elongated nodular opacity along the anterior left upper lobe (LUL) bronchus and adjacent to a large blood vessel (3.8 mm) (Fig. 1). A robotic assisted bronchoscopic biopsy of the LUL lesion was recommended, and the procedure was performed by an expert bronchoscopist with specialized interventional pulmonology training. The RAB was performed under general anesthesia, and paralytics were used. The airway was accessed through a size 8 standard endotracheal tube (ET). The endobronchial navigation was performed after alveolar recruitment maneuver was performed and continued with a PEEP of 10 for the rest of the procedure. These maneuvers were performed with the intention to split open small subsegmental airways and facilitate the advancement of the scope beyond the 5th-6th generation without air insufflation.",

Suction was applied to the proximal end of the robotic catheter. Simultaneously, a flexible bronchoscope (4 mm OD), with a 2.0-mm working channel, was inserted into the airways, parallel to the robotic scope, to help control the bleeding. The flexible bronchoscope was inserted through  the  nose,  traversing  the  vocal  cords  parallel  to  the  ET (Fig. 3a). The ET cuff was then partially deflated, and the bronchoscope was advanced into the distal trachea and distal left main stem bronchus  (Fig.  3b-d).  Bleeding  was  noted  emanating  from  the LUL surrounding the wedged robotic bronchoscope (Fig. 2, 3g).

However, the experience with bleeding during RAB is limited.

It is reported to complicate 2.4% of RABs [2, 4]. Its current treatment includes tamponade"

The treatment modalities for SAB are limited, and this is in part due to the tradeoff between the stability and reach needed for peripheral bronchoscopy  against  the  delayed  reaction  capacity  and small channel allowing for suboptimal suction. Fortunately, this complication appears to be rare; however, it remains a constant threat to patients, and a clear and effective treatment algorithm is required. If such an episode is encountered in the future, it is the authors' recommendation to implement our proposed management strategy with combined,  simultaneous  flexible  and  robotic  bronchoscopy (Fig. 2) as a next immediate step (Table 1).",

Limitations in existing guided bronchoscopy platforms has led to developments in robotic assisted technologies. These devices may allow the bronchoscopist to more precisely maneuver the scope and instruments into the periphery of the lungs under direct visualization while also ensuring stability during sampling of the target lesions. These devices have the potential to improve the diagnostic yield in sampling peripheral lung lesions and may play a role in the treatment of non-operable or oligometastatic peripheral tumors using bronchoscopic ablative therapies. In this article, we review the existing robotic bronchoscopy technologies and summarize the available pre-clinical and clinical data supporting their use."
