These include the stability of the system, the ability of the  catheter  to  remain  in  position  without  the need of human hands, and the improved navigation platform. 2"

Although not optimal, initial airway clearance was performed using a small bronchoscope through a 6.5  ETT  prior  to  performing  RAB.  The  ETT adapter was connected to the 6.5 cuffed ETT, and RAB was performed without interruption. We are not aware of any other reported cases in the literature  describing  the  use  of  robotic  bronchoscopy through a small nasal airway. This case highlights a deviation from recommended protocols suggesting larger oral ETT in patients undergoing RAB. This illustrated approach of using a smaller ETT, via oral or nasal routes, could be useful in patients with history of head and neck cancers, limited jaw movement, and in patients with a known history of tracheal stenosis."

Since  rapid  on-site  cytology  was  negative  from the LUL nodule, we drove the IRB catheter and parked it 7  mm away from lymph node station 5. We then extended a 21-gauge needle under fluoroscopic guidance and obtained a sample, which came back consistent with small cell carcinoma. The final pathology from LUL nodule was nondiagnostic.

The drive force signal feature was helpful in alleviating  these  concerns.  In  addition,  we  used  a diagnostic  bronchoscope  which  was  navigated through the airways on the side of the ETT. We wanted to document the position of the Ion catheter  tip  in  close  proximity  to  the  stump  while avoiding  excessive  pressure.

The advanced  features  of  RAB  in  these  scenarios allowed for obtaining diagnostic samples in patients who otherwise would have required surgical  and  more  invasive  approaches.  RAB  was used  unconventionally  in  this  series  to  access through a nasal artificial airway, to sample mediastinal  lymph  node  stations  not  reachable  with convex Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) bronchoscope, and to reach recurrent lung cancer hidden behind a previous airway stump. RAB systems provide advantageous catheter maneuverability  and  stability, and  these promising features should be explored further in clinical  situations  not  amenable  to  conventional bronchoscopy."

Protocols and guidelines have since been published advocating use of large oral artificial airways, use of confirmatory technologies such as radial endobronchial ultrasound (R-EBUS), and preferably limiting sampling to pulmonary parenchymal lesions. We present three clinical cases where RAB was used unconventionally to sample pulmonary nodules in unusual locations and in patients with challenging airway anatomy. In case 1, we introduced the ion catheter through a nasal airway in a patient with trismus. In case 2, we established a diagnosis by sampling a station 5 lymph node, and in case 3, we sampled a lesion located behind an airway stump from previous thoracic surgery. All three patients would have presented significant challenges for alternative biopsy modalities such as CT-guided needle biopsy or video-assisted thoracic surgery.",

Limitations in existing guided bronchoscopy platforms has led to developments in robotic assisted technologies. These devices may allow the bronchoscopist to more precisely maneuver the scope and instruments into the periphery of the lungs under direct visualization while also ensuring stability during sampling of the target lesions. These devices have the potential to improve the diagnostic yield in sampling peripheral lung lesions and may play a role in the treatment of non-operable or oligometastatic peripheral tumors using bronchoscopic ablative therapies. In this article, we review the existing robotic bronchoscopy technologies and summarize the available pre-clinical and clinical data supporting their use."

        "abstract": "<b>Rationale:</b> Conventional electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy and other guided bronchoscopic modalities have a very desirable safety profile, but their diagnostic yield is only 60-70% for pulmonary lesions. Recently, robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (RAB) platforms have been introduced to improve the diagnostic performance of bronchoscopic modalities. <b>Objectives:</b> To determine the diagnostic performance and safety profile of RAB (using shape-sensing and electromagnetic navigation-based platforms) by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis. <b>Methods:</b> The PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar databases were searched to find studies that reported on the diagnostic performance and/or the safety profile of one of the RAB systems. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tool. Meta-analysis was performed using MedCalc version 20.118. Pooled diagnostic yield was calculated using a Freeman-Tukey transformation. We planned to use a random-effects model if the <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> index was &gt;40%. <b>Results:</b> Twenty-five studies were included: 20 including diagnostic and safety analyses and 5 including only safety analyses. The pooled diagnostic yield of RAB (20 studies, 1,779 lesions) was 84.3% (95% confidence interval, 81.1-87.2%). The <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> index was 65.6%. On the basis of our subgroup analyses, the heterogeneity was likely driven by differences in study designs (prospective vs. retrospective) and procedural protocols (such as different RAB systems). Lesion size&#x2009;&gt;&#x2009;2&#x2009;cm, the presence of a computed tomography bronchus sign, and concentric radial endobronchial ultrasound view were associated with a statistically significant increase in the odds of diagnosis with RAB. The overall rates of pneumothorax, need for tube thoracostomy, and significant hemorrhage were 2.3%, 1.2%, and 0.5%, respectively. <b>Conclusions:</b> RAB systems have significantly increased the diagnostic yield of navigational bronchoscopy compared with conventional systems such as electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy, but well-designed prospective studies are needed to better understand the impact of various factors, such as the use of three-dimensional imaging modalities, cryobiopsy, and specific ventilatory protocols, on the diagnostic yield of RAB."

        "abstract": "Despite many advancements in recent years for the sampling of peripheral pulmonary lesions, the diagnostic yield remains low. Initial excitement about the current electromagnetic navigation platforms has subsided as the real-world data shows a significantly lower diagnostic sensitivity of ~70%. \"CT-to-body divergence\" has been identified as a major limitation of this modality. In-tandem use of the ultrathin bronchoscope and radial endobronchial ultrasound probe has yielded only comparable results, attributable to the limited peripheral reach, device maneuverability, stability, and distractors like atelectasis. As such, experts have identified three key steps in peripheral nodule sampling-navigation (to the lesion), confirmation (of the correct location), and acquisition (tissue sampling by tools). Robotic bronchoscopy (RB) is a novel innovation that aspires to improve upon these aspects and consequently, achieve a better diagnostic yield. Through this publication, we aim to review the technical aspects, safety, feasibility, and early efficacy data for this new diagnostic modality."

        "abstract": "Recent advances in navigational platforms have led bronchoscopists to make major strides in diagnostic interventions for pulmonary parenchymal lesions. Over the last decade, multiple platforms including electromagnetic navigation and robotic bronchoscopy have allowed bronchoscopists to safely navigate farther into the lung parenchyma with increased stability and accuracy. Limitations persist, even with these newer technologies, in achieving a similar or higher diagnostic yield when compared to the transthoracic computed tomography (CT) guided needle approach. One of the major limitations to this effect is due to CT-to-body divergence. Real-time feedback that better defines the tool-lesion relationship is vital and can be obtained with additional imaging using radial endobronchial ultrasound, C-arm based tomosynthesis, cone-beam CT (fixed or mobile), and O-arm CT. Herein, we describe the role of this adjunct imaging with robotic bronchoscopy for diagnostic purposes, describe potential strategies to counteract the CT-to-body divergence phenomenon, and address the potential role of advanced imaging for lung tumor ablation."

Advanced bronchoscopic navigational techniques have improved the airway-based approaches to these lesions. Robotic Assisted Bronchoscopy (RAB) can be considered the current pinnacle of this evolution; allowing for a safer approach to sampling lesions previously considered outside of bronchoscopic reach. We present a comprehensive review of the changing epidemiology of lung cancer and the importance of early tissue sampling, the evolution of sampling and navigational bronchoscopic techniques, technical considerations and evidence pertaining to the use of RAB, and adjunct techniques in the diagnosis of lung cancer. Complications and future applications of RAB are also discussed."
